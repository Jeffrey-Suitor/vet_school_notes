## Blood Smear Prep
Equipment needed:
- Clean glass slides
- Micro-chromatic tubes
- Blood sample

If it has been sitting make sure to mix
Fill tube 1/3 full
Pull second slide back, wait to spread, and then push forward
Well made blood smear has a nice even layer of cells
Make sure to label with patient number, last name of patient, and date of sample, write in pencil

## Blood Smear Evaluation

Feathered edge is slightly rounded
Lighter area is the monolayer

In body of smear looking for platelet clumps, abnormal white cells, large organisms

Check feathered edge for platelet clumps, abnormal white cells, large organisms

In monolayer where you do the white cell count, type, morphology change, number of red cells
