# C2S - L8 - Transport Of Molecules Around The Body
## Intended Learning Outcomes
- Describe the major body fluid compartments and the composition of intracellular and extracellular body fluid
- Explain how water and solutes traverse the capillary wall, using Fickâ€™s equation and Starlingâ€™s hypothesis
- Describe the organization of the cardiovascular and lymphatic systems and their role in fluid homeostasis
- Explain the mechanisms underlying disruptions to fluid homeostasis including oedema and lymphoedema

## Body Fluids

What are the three types of body fluid::intracellular, extracellular fluid, plasma

What are the types of the extracellular fluid::plasma, interstitial fluid, lymph, transcellular fluid (CSF, synovial fluid)

What are the is the composition of total body water and what are the contributes of each element
?
60% of lean body weight
1/3 extracellular
  - 1/4 plasma
  - 3/4 interstitial
  - Exchange of water solutes, nutrients and gases occurs via diffusion and osmosis driven by hydrostatic and oncotic pressures
2/3 intracellular
- Water, solutes, nutrients, and gases must cross the cell membrane
- Simple diffusion and osmosis occurs for some molecules
- Additional transport mechanisms are required for others

What is the function of the capillary membrane::H20 and most plasma constituents (except plasma proteins) freely exchanged, composition of plasma and interstitial fluid is similar, plasma is the only fluid compartment that can be actively modified

T/F The plasma compartment is the only one which can be actively modified::True

What is the function of the cell membrane::highly selective, permits movement of some molecules but not others, passive and active mechanisms

How much protein is in the interstitial fluid::essentially 0

How does the concentration of molecules differ in the intracellular fluid compared to other body fluid compartment::less Na+, higher K+, lower CL-, lower Ca2+

What are the signs associated with dehydration and their dehydration estimate
?
| Clinical Sign        | Dehydration estimate |
| -------------------- | -------------------- |
| Normal               | < 5%                 |
| Dry mucous membranes | 5%                   |
| Reduced skin turgoe  | 6-8%                 |
| Increased HR         | 8-10%                |
| Weak pulses          | 10-12%               |
| Collapse, shock      | 12-15%               |

What are the two forces which help with passive movement of molecules across membranes
?
Diffusion: down a concentration gradient
Movement along an electrical gradient

Example the process of diffusion and give an example::Diffusion moves down a concentration gradient due to random molecular collisions. The membrane barrier and the substance can permeate the membrane, will move from high to low concentration. An example is the diffusion of oxygen from the lung into the blood.

What is Fick's equation
?
The factors which influence the rate of net diffusion across the membrane
1. Magnitude of concentration gradient: grater difference in concentration, faster rate of net diffusion
2. Permeability of the membrane to the substance: Greater permeability, faster rate of net diffusion
3. Surface area of membrane available for diffusion: Larger surface area, faster the rate of net diffusion
4. Molecular weight of substance: heavier the molecule, the slower the rate of net diffusion
5. Distance of diffusion: greater the distance, the slower the rate of net diffusion
Diffusion rate = surface area x concentration gradient x membrane permeability / membrane thickness

Describe the process of osmosis::diffusion of water across it's own concentration gradient. Water will flow across a membrane that is permeable to water but not solutes

What are some key traits of water that makes it great at diffusion::small polar molecule, this allows it to pass through lipid bilayer of cell membrane, also can pass thorugh channels aquaporins in cell membrane

What direction does water flow in osmosis::Region of higher water concentration to a region of lower water concentration

Describe how osmosis would work on pure water, presence of solutes, and with osmotic pressure
?
Pure water: There is no net diffusion of water across a membrane
Solutes: Less water concentration in solutes so water flows to salt
Osmotic pressure: There is an amount of pressure require to stop the flow of water across the membrane

Describe how we maintain fluid balance
?
ECF volume and osmolarity is tightly regulated
ECF volume: critical for blood pressure
ECF osmolarity: critical to prevent swelling/shrinking of cells due to osmosis

What is tonicity and describe the 3 types of solution
?
effect of a solution on cell volume
Hypertonic: fluid leaves cell due to higher solutes outside cell, cell shrinks and crenates
Isonotic: fluid remains constant due to balanced water concentration, no cell change
Hypotonic: fluid enters the cell to due to less solutes outside the cell, cell expands and can cause lysis

## Cardiac and Lymphatic System

What is the high level summary of the cardiovascular system
?
Heart: driving force, propels blood around the body
Arterial system: the distribution channels
Microcirculation: the exchange vessels
Venous: blood reservoirs, return blood to the heart

Describe the functions of blood vessels
?
| Functional Groups     | Function                                                                                                           |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Conducting arteries   | Elastic arteries that act as a pressure reservoir - elastic recoil continues driving blood forward during diastole |
| Distributing arteries | Primary role to conduct flwo to smaller arteries, can change diameter actively                                     |
| Resistance vessels    | Control local blood flow to tissues. Main source of peripheral resistance, control arterial pressure               |
| Exchange vessels      | Site of metabolic exchange. Low ressitance, high corss-sectional area to faciliate exchange                        |
| Capacitance vessels   | Act as a reservoir of blood, stabilize and regulate venous return to the heart                                                                                                                   |

What are capillaries and describe their structure and function::exchange of fluid (nutrients and metabolic products) between blood and interstitial fluid, capillary walls are made up of a single layer of endothelial cells, capillaries are located close to every cell in body

What are the 4 types of capillaries, where are they found, and what is their key features
?
Continuous (muscle, skin, lung, fat, connective tissue): Contain narrow junction (clefts) and small coated pits (caveolae)
Fenestrated (kidneys, intestines, endocrine glands, joints): Contain pores or fenestrae - permeable to small molecules
Discontinuous (bone marrow, liver, spleen): Wide gaps between endothelial cells - permeable to large molecules
Neural (brain): Endothelial cells fused together by tight junctions and covered by thick basement membrane and astrocyte processes. Water diffuses, solutes require specific transport

Rank the capillary types from least leaky to most leaky::neural, continuous, fenestrated, discontinuous

What are the 3 methods for movement of substances across capillary walls
?
Diffusion: lipid soluble molecules across EC membranes, lipid insoluble pass between ECs and through pores, rate of diffusion described by Fick's Law
Transcytosis or pinocytosis: Movement of macromolecules across ECs in vesicles
Bulk flow via Starling's Forces: Bulk flow of fluid through channels in capillary walls, molecules moving together in bulk, transfer of water and dissolved substances across capillaries depend on net hydrostatic and osmotic forces

What is Starling's Forces and what are the forces
?
Four forces influencing bulk flow
Capillary blood pressure (Pc): hydrostatic pressure exerted on the capillary wall by the blood. Forces fluid out of the capillary
Plasma colloid osmotic pressure (also known as oncotic pressure ||p): force caused by plasma proteins which remain in plasma, which exerts an osmotic effect on water. Forces fluid into the plasma compartment
Interstitial fluid pressure (Pif): hydrostatic pressure exerted by the interstitial fluid on the outside of the capillary wall. forces fluid into capillaries
Interstitial fluid colloid osmotic pressure(||if): the protein concentration in the interstitium is normally very low, and so this force is close to zero
Net filtration pressure (NFP) = Filtration + Absorption
NFP = (Pc = ||if) - (Pif + ||p)

Why is filtration greatest at the arterial end of the capillary
?
Hydrostatic forces favour filtration are greatest at the arterial end of capillaries
Oncotic osmotic pressure predominates at the venous ends of the capillaries ensuring 90$ of the fluid is reabsorbed which creates a filtration absorption imbalance
Positive NFP equation is net filtration (out) and negative NFP is net absorption

T/F The following NFP equation of NFP = (35 + 3) - (28 + 0) = +10 which would indicate that the current osmotic gradient would lead to reabsorption::False, a positive NFP number indicates that there is net filtration (out)

T/F In normal circumstances slightly more fluid is filtered out of capillaries than is reabsorbed back into plasma::True, this extra fluid is picked up by the lymphatic system as lymph

Describe the lymphatic system and it's 4 functions
?
Extensive network of one-way vessels
Functions as a tissue drainage system and is responsible for returning excess interstitial fluid back to the venous circulation
1. Return of excess filtered fluid to the bloodstream
2. Defence against disease: lymph passes through lymph nodes located within the lymphatic system
3. Transport of absorbed fat: fat absorbed in the GI system is unable to access capillaries but can enter initial lymphatics
4. Return of filtered proteins: when plasma proteins do leak capillaries, they travel within the lymphatics back to the intravascular space

Describe the structure of the lymphatic system
?
Lymphatic capillaries form plexuses plexuses that give rise to larger lymphatic vessels
These converse into large trunks which open into the major veins in the thorax
Lymph nodes are placed along lymph pathways - lymph passes through a node before entering the blood stream
In lymph nodes, it is exposed to lymphocytes and phagocytes, provides for immune surveillance

What is oedema and where can it occur
?
The accumulation of excess body fluid in the ECF or ICF
Caused by a disturbance in Starling's forces
Intracellular oedema: due to physical damage to cell membrane of failure of cell metaolism leading to excessive Na+ and water entry
Extracellular oedema: accumulation in interstitial tissues or in body cavities

What are the causes of extracellular oedema and give an example of each
?
1. Increased plasma hydrostatic pressure (hypertension)
2. Decreased plasma colloid oncotic pressure (low plasma proteins)
3. Lymphatic obstruction  (lymphoedema)
4. Increased vascular permeability (sites of inflammation)
5. Sodium retention

Describe lymphoedema and provide some potential causes
?
Impairment of lymphatic drainage causes lymphoedema upstream
generally localised to the drainage field of the damaged/obstructed area
Can be caused by damage to, or obstruction of, lymphatic vessels or nodes (trauma, inflammation, infection)
