## Intended Learning Outcomes
- Describe the composition of the cell membrane and explain how the distribution of phospholipids and proteins influences the membrane permeability to ions, hydrophilic and hydrophobic compounds, and cell-cell communication
- Describe how cells regulate the movement of substances across their membranes and the role of diffusion, facilitated diffusion, and primary and secondary active transport mechanisms
- Explain how energy from the Na+ and K+ electrochemical gradients across the plasma membrane are maintained

## Transport of Fluid Across Cell Membranes

What are some of the key function of biological membranes
?
1. Selective barrier: Regulates flow of material into and out of the cell
2. Organization: form compartment (organelles), help maintain separates and distinct molecular environments
3. Transport: Contain specific molecular pumps and channels for transporting solutes
4. Controlling information flow: Specific receptors for external signalling, generate chemical and electrical signals
5. Cell to cell interactions: cell recognition, cell adhesion
6. Reactions: enzyme activity

What are the constituents of the plasma membrane::phospholipid bilayer, proteins (integral, surface), cholesterol, carbohydrates linked to proteins and lipid

Describe the fluid mosaic model::Membrane proteins move freely in the lipid layer, ever changing pattern of proteins, and the cytoskeleton can restrict proteins to specific areas of cell membrane

Describe the structure of the phospholipid bilayer
?
2 sets of phospholipids, tail to tail
Hydrophilic polar head group which is attracted to water
Hydrophobic nonpolar, tail region composed of fatty acids

What is the importance of cholesterol in the phospholipid bilayer::inserts between phospholipids to support membrane fluidity

Describe the permeability of the phospholipid bilayer
?
Hydrophobic (lipid soluble) region which diffuses quickly
Hydrophilic (lipid insoluble) which makes hydrophilic substances in membranes sparingly soluble
1. Nonpolar molecules: pass freely (fatty acids, steroid hormones, Co2, O2)
2. Small uncharged polar molecules: pass freely but more slowly than nonpolar molecules (H20)
3. Large polar molecules and ions: Don't pass freely (glucose, Na+)
4. Macromolecules: Don't pass (proteins, polysaccharides, nucleic acids)

Why are Co2 and O2 nonpolar::Due to their linearity which gives them nonpolar properties

What are integral membrane proteins::permanently attached to the cell membrane lipid bilayer, some span the entire membrane (e.g. ion channels, hormone receptors), others are embedded (enzymes)

What are peripherally associated membrane proteins::not permanently attached to the cell membrane lipid bilayer,  non-covalently bound, often attached to integral proteins (e.g. regulatory protein, transporter proteins, enzymes)

What are the functions of membrane proteins
?
1. Transport: form hydrophilic channels across lipid bilayer which are highly selective
2. Enzymatic activity: Control chemical reactions inside or outside cell
3. Signal transduction: receptor proteins that receive external signals
4. Cell recognition: facilitate cell to cell interactions, cells' ability to recognize self
5. Intercellular joining: cell adhesion molecules, form loops or hooks to grip other cells
6. Attachment: proteins that connect the cell to extracellular matrix

Describe membrane channels used for simple diffusion
?
Pores: conduits which are always open
Channels (gated): Which are gated by a door which can be opened or closed

Describe the types of gated ion channels
?
Voltage gated (Na+ or K+, specific to each channel)
Chemical or ligand gated (acetylcholine ACH as an example)
Mechanically gated (sound waves in inner ear open ion channels)

What are the three types of transport across biological membranes::simple diffusion, facilitated diffusion, active transport

## Passive Diffusion

Describe simple diffusion
?
Movement down a concentration or electrical gradient
- Through membrane (lipid soluble molecules)
- Through pores - integral cell membrane protein (aquaporin for water)
- Through protein channels - selectively permeable, may be gated (ion channels)

Describe facilitated diffusion
?
Down a concentration of electrical gradient
- Carrier mediated - need integral membrane protein
- Transporter is specific for the molecule
- Rate limited by binding and conformational change in carrier protein; (glucose, amino acids)

Describe active transport::up a concentration or electrical gradient and is carrier mediated and energy dependent

Describe the carrier mediation of facilitated diffusion
?
Carrier protein used to facilitate transfer across membrane and down a concentration gradient
Molecule binds to a receptor within carrier protein
Binding triggers a shape (conformation) change of carrier protein allowing entry to opposite side of membrane
Release returns carrier protein's shape to original or unoccupied state
Carrier proteins demonstrate specificity
Transport is rate limited by concentration of molecule and number of channels (receptors become saturated)
Example: glucose (in most cells) and amino acids

In facilitated diffusion what rate limits transport::the concentration of the molecule and the number of channels

T/F Carrier proteins in facilitated demonstrate specificity::True as they have specific conformational changes 

## Active Transport

Describe generally active transport and the differences between primary and secondary active transport
?
Use of protein carrier to carry a specific substance
Transported against concentration or electrochemical gradient
Require expenditure of energy (in the form of ATP) to drive carrier
Active transport mechanisms are often called pumps
Primary active transport: directly uses chemical energy (mostly ATP) to move molecules
Secondary active transport: uses an electrochemical gradient generated by active transport as an energy source to move molecules against the gradient. It does not directly require a chemical source of energy such as ATP

Describe the general overview sodium potassium ATPase pump
?
Primary active transport
Found in the membrane of cells
Concentrates NA+ in the ECF and K+ in the ICF
3 receptors of Na+ inside cell and 2 receptors for K+ outside cell
ATPase activated when ions bind --> cleaves 1 molecule of ATP
Liberated energy causes conformational change in carrier which flips the ions across the membrane

What are the 3 functions of the sodium potassium ATPase pump
?
1. Establishes Na+ and K+ concentration gradients across the cell membrane, interior of cell negative with respect to exterior, critical for propagation of action potential sin nerves and for muscle contraction
2. Regulates cell volume by controlling solute concentrations, minimizes osmotic effects that would induce swelling/shrinking of cell
3. Energy used also indirectly serves a s energy source for co-transport of glucose and amino acids through secondary active transport

Describe the process of secondary active transport
?
Uses an electrochemical gradient generated by active transport as an energy source to move molecules against their gradient
Intestinal and kidney cells actively transport glucose and amino acids up their concentration gradients
Co-transport carriers have two binding sites - one for Na+ and another for the nutrient molecule (glucose)
When both glucose and Na+ are bound to carrier it changes shape and opens to the inside of the cell, both Na+ and glucose are released into the ICF
Released Na+ is quickly pumped out again by the Na+ -K+ ATPase pump to keep intracellular Na+ low maintaining Na+ concentration gradient across membrane

Describe the process of vesicular transport
?
Some large molecules/multimolecular materials are too large for channels and carriers
They are transferred in a membrane enclosed vesicle for vesicular transport
vesicular transport requires energy (active transport mechanism)
Transport into the cell = endocytosis, transport out of the cell = exocytosis

What are the three forms of endocytosis
?
1. Pinocytosis: non-selective uptake of ECF
2. Receptor mediated endocytosis (large molecule)
3. Phagocytosis (multimolecular particles)

What is the order of vesicular transport
?
1. Vesicle buds off from plasma membrane
2. Vesicle transport intact, release contents to exterior by exocytosis or fuses with  a lysosome
3. Membrane components recycled to the plasma membrane

Describe the membrane potential of cells
?
All cells have a membrane potential due to difference in the relative number of cations and anions in the ICF and ECF
The ions primarily responsible are Na+, K+ and negatively charged intracellular proteins
Negatively charged intracellular proteins cannot permeate the membrane, unbalanced distribution, ICF is more negative than ECF

How much of membrane potential is generated by the sodium potassium pump::20%, rest is generated through the passive diffusion of Na+ and K+ down concentration gradients

Describe the interaction of ion concentrations and electrical gradients using potassium as an example
?
For K+, the concentration gradient would tend to move the ion out of the cell but the electrical gradient would tend to move K+ into the cell
K+ diffuses out of the cell down it's concentration gradient until electrical forces prevent further net diffusion
More diffusion (leak) channels for K+ than Na+ so K+ leaves than Na+ enters
Negative ions that can't easily diffuse remain in ICF which results in a net negative charge within a cell.

T/F The charge inside a cell is net positive::False, the charge inside a cell is net negative

Describe the movement of sodium and potassium when the cell is at rest
?
Resting membrane potential is maintained
Passive leaks of Na+ and K+ down their electrochemical gradient
Counterbalanced by sodium potassium pump
No net movement of Na+ and K=, membrane potential remains constant
