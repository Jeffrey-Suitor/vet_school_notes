# C2S - L10 - Role Of Blood And Blood Cells In Homeostasis
## Intended Learning Outcomes
- Describe the components of blood (cells, ions, proteins, platelets), giving their normal values, and explain how blood is important for maintaining homeostasis.  
- Describe the leukocytes found in the blood of normal animals and the differences in appearance between common domestic species.
- Describe the normal balance of leukocyte turnover and how this can alter in response to infection.

## Composition of Blood

What are the 4 components of blood::plasma, red blood cells (erythrocytes, RBC), white blood cells (leukocytes, WBC) platelets. 55% of blood volume is plasma

What are the components of plasma
?
Water (90%)
Ions/Salts (Na, Cl, K, HCO3, PO4)
Protein (albumin, globulins - antibodies, clotting proteins - fibrinogen, hormones)
Nutrients (glucose)
Enzymes
Waster products (urea)
Dissolved gases (O2, CO2)

What is a anti-coagulant used for separating blood::EDTA, Heparin

If you spin down a sample of blood with an anticoagulant what are the 3 constituents that will emerge and what are their relative abundance
?
Plasma: 55% of total blood volume
Buffy Coat: Leukocytes (WBCs) (~8x10^9/L) and platelets (~250x10^9/L)
Red blood cells: (RBCs) which is about 45% (~5x10^12/L)

What is the difference between plasma and serum::plasma = serum + coagulation factors (including fibrinogen)

T/F plasma  = serum + coagulation factors (not including fibrinogen)::False, plasma = serum + coagulation factors (INCLUDING fibrinogen)

T/F serum contains coagulation factors::False, serum does not contain coagulation fibres

What are the components of plasma
?
90 - 92% of water
6-7%
- Albumin: colloid osmotic pressure
- Globulin: enzymes, antibodies
- Fibrinogen - polymerizes into fibrin during coagulation or clot formation
2-3% other
- Fats
- Carbohydrates (glucose)
- Electrolytes: Bicarbonate, calcium, chloride, magneium, phosphorus, potassium, sodium
- Gases ($O_2$, $CO_2$)
- Chemical messengers

What aspects will of the blood will analyzer analyze
?
Red blood cell count (RBC)
White blood cell count (WBC): Differential counts
Platelets
Haematocrit (Hct) or PCB
Haemoglobin (Hb)

T/F Hct, RBC count and Hb should be proportional::True

What are 2 factors that can affect plasma levels::Dehydration: can mask anaemia and increased fluid in pregnancy can mimic anaemia

T/F Increased fluid in pregnancy will not affect testing for anaemia::False, increased fluid in pregnancy can mimic anaemic

T/F Dehydration can mimic anaemia in blood testing::False, dehydration can mask anaemia in blood testing

How do we analyze protein in content in the blood
?
Total protein: refractometer or biochemistry
Albumin: biochemistry or protein electrophoresis
Globulins: Total proteins - Albumin

How do we measure electrolytes in plasma::Na, K, Cl, $HCO_3$ - ion specific electrode or biochemical method

How do we measure enzymes in the plasma::biochemical methods

How is lipids in the blood measured and what is measured::triglycerides and cholesterol are measured via biochemistry

How do we measure the level of glucose in the blood::glucometer or biochemistry

What are haemopoietic stem cells
?
Morphologically indistinguishable from a small lymphocyte
Multipotent - not pluripotent: can differentiate into any of the mature haemopoietic cell precursors - myeloblastis monoblasts, rubriblasts, megakaryoblasts
Rare in bone marrow (< 0.2% of haemopoietic cells)
Very potent: 
- as few as 30 cells can repopulate the haemopoietic system of an irradiated mouse
- One HSC can produce up to 700,000 progeny by clonal expansion 

T/F haemopoietic stem cells are pluripotent::False, they are multipotent but not pluripotent

What can haemopoietic stem cells differentiate into::myeloblastis, monoblasts, rubriblasts, megakaryoblasts

T/F haemopoietic stem cells are common in bone marrow::False, they are very rare making up less than 0.2% of haemopoietic cells

What are the 5 types of cells that can originate from leukopoiesis::macrophages, neutrophil, eosinophil, mast cells

What are the 3 precursor stages of the macrophage::monoblast, promonocyte, monocyte

T/F macrophages are found in circulation::False, monocytes are found in circulation not macrophages

What are the 3 types of cells that share common precursor names in leukopoiesis and what are the precursor names::granulocytes (neutrophil, eosinophil, basophil), myeloblast, promyelocyte, myelocyte, metamyelocyte

What are the three cells involved in thrombopoiesis::megakaryoblast, megakaryocyte, platelets

What are the cells involved in erythropoiesis::rubriblast, prorubricyte, rubricyte, metarubricyte, reticulocyte, erythrocyte

Describe the structure and composition of red blood cells
?
Most common blood cell, 4 - 10 um
Contents: water (60%) + haemoglobin (40%)
Biconcave disk - maximises surface area
Anucleate in mammals, nucleated in birds and reptiles and fish
Stain eosinophilic (pink)

What is the ultrastructure of red blood cells::homogeneous and electron dense with no organelles in mature mammalian RBC

T/F in immature RBCs there are organelles::True, but there are none in mature RBCs

What is the function of haemoglobin::carry $0_2$, $CO_2$ & $H^+$ (buffering role)

What is the lifespan of RBCs in cats, dogs, humans, horses, cattle, and sheep
?
| Animal                | Lifespan in days |
| --------------------- | ---------------- |
| Cats                  | 80               |
| Dogs, Humans          | 100-120          |
| Horses, Cattle, Sheep | 150              |

T/F Red blood cells in birds and reptiles have a nucleus::True, but not in mammals
