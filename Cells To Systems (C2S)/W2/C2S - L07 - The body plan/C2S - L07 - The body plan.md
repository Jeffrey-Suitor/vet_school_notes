# C2S - L7 - The body plan

## Intended Learning Outcomes
- Identify regions of the body by their anatomical name in domestic and novel species, necessary to communicate in an effective way
- Describe the position and relationships of the major systems in relation to the major bones of the quadruped skeleton and in relation to each other, so they can be found in any animal you are presented with
- Identify major structures of the major systems by their anatomical name and relative position, to facilitate communication about these body systems
- Find selected structures from a written description and/or their anatomical name, a necessary skill in a veterinary career, for example to follow instructions to perform a surgery

## The body plan

What are the regions of the forelimb::shoulder or scapular region, brachial region or brachium, antebrachium, carpus, metacarpus, digital (phalangeal) region, manus (metacarpus, carpus, digital region)

What are the regions of the hind-limb::rump or gluteal region, thigh, carpus, tarsus, metatarsus, digital (phalangeal) region, pes (tarsus, metatarsus, digital region)

What is the diaphragm::the body sheet which divides the thorax from the abdomen

What are the 3 body cavities::thoracic cavity, abdominal cavity, pelvic cavity

T/F The abdominal cavity and pelvic cavity are connected::True

What are the 5 generalised systems in the body::musculoskeletal, integument, cardiovascular, nervous, lymphatic

What composes the musculoskeletal system::bones, joints, muscles, tendons, ligaments, fascia

What composes the integument::skin, hair, glands, pads, claws, nasal plate

What is an erosion cast::Substance is injected postmortem to outline all the capillaries and other elements of the cardiovascular system

What are the major structures of the cardiovascular system

| Heart             | Cranial ventral part of the thorax behind the 3-5 ribs                                                                                     | Pumps blood                                                                                               |
| Aorta             | Dorsal to the heart and runs medially and caudally along the body                                                                          | Largest blood vessel in the body, supplies blood to all caudal structures in the body                     |
| Caudal vena cava  | Caudal and then runs through the dorsal abdomen and dorsal thorax to enter the caudal dorsal heart                                         | Transport the majority of blood from caudal structures back to the heart except from the digestive system |
| Portal vein       | Medial and central runs from the intestines to the liver                                                                                   | Brings blood from the intestines to the liver for processing                                              |
| Carotid artery    | Cranial to the heart and ventral to the cervical vertebrae                                                                                 | Supplies the brain with blood                                                                             |
| Jugular veins     | Runs down the ventro lateral side of the neck, enters the thorax, and joins with the blood from the forelimb to form the cranial vena cava | Returns blood from the head                                                                               |
| Cranail vena cava | Enters the heart via the cranial dorsal aspect                                                                                             | Returns blood to the heart from cranial structures                                                        |
