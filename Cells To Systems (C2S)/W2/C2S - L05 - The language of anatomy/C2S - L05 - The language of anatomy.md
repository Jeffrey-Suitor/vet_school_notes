# C2S - L5 - The language of anatomy

## Inteded Learning outcomes
- Describe the position, relationships, form, and appearance of important animal structures and features to enable meaningful, unambiguous communication
- Apply correct terminology for normal and novel structures in a meaningful way, an essential skill for a veterinarian

| Tranverse | At right angles to the long axis of the body part being sectioned. Different directions on body compared to limbs, divides body into cranial and caudal parts, Divides limbs into distal and proximal. |
| Dorsal    | Right angle to both median adn transverse planes, parallel to ground, divides body into dorsal and ventral                                                                                              |

| Flexion        | Angle between the bones at a joint become smaller                      |
| Extension      | The angle between the bones at a joint approaches 180                  |
| Hyperextension | A joiny travels beyond 180 in a continuation of the extension movement |
