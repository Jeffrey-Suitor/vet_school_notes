CELLS TO SYSTEMS – EPITHELIAL TISSUES

Classification of epithelia
Epithelium (singular), epithelia (plural) present in two major forms:
•

Surface epithelium – sheets of cells that cover external surfaces and line
internal surfaces of the body

•

Glandular epithelium – secretory cells of glands

Classification of epithelia based on the number of cell layers
1. Simple epithelia – a single cell layer thick
2. Stratified epithelia – two or more layers of cells
3. Pseudostratified epithelia – appear to be stratified, because the cells vary in
height and the nuclei lie at different levels

Classification of epithelia based on the shape of cells
1. Squamous cells – flat cells
2. Cuboidal cells – Height and width of the cells are the same
3. Columnar cells – cells are taller than they are wide
Simple squamous epithelium
•

This type is composed of a single layer of flattened, scale- or plate-like cells.

•

Occurs in many organs.

•

The large body cavities and heart, blood vessels and lymph vessels are
typically lined by a simple squamous epithelium.

•

The nuclei of the epithelial cells are often flattened or ovoid, i.e. egg-shaped,
and they are located close to the centre of the cells.

Simple cuboidal epithelium
•

Cells appear cuboidal in sections perpendicular to the surface of the
epithelium. Viewed from the surface of the epithelium they look rather like
small polygons.

•

Simple cuboidal epithelium occurs in small excretory ducts of many glands,
the follicles of the thyroid gland, the tubules of the kidney and on the surface
of the ovaries.

Simple columnar epithelium
•

The cells forming a simple columnar epithelium are taller than they are
wide.

•

The nuclei of cells within the epithelium are usually located at the same
height within the cells - often close to the base of the cells.

•

An example is the simple columnar epithelium which lines the internal
surface of the small and large intestines.

Tips for Identifying epithelium in histology sections
•

The outlines of individual epithelial cells are not always visible, and it may
be difficult to identify the shape of the cells.

•

It is often helpful to look at the shape, location and spacing of the nuclei in
the epithelium.

•

How many cell layers seem to be visible in a section depends very much on
the angle between the plane of the section and the plane of the surface of the
epithelium.

•

Oblique sections of epithelium will be visible in almost all slides of organs
in which epithelium lines a surface with a very irregular profile. A single
surface is usually not lined by several types of epithelia.

•

The number of epithelial cell layers will usually be the smallest number of
layers visible anywhere along the surface lined by the epithelium.

Sublingual Gland, H&E
Blood vessels are probably present in all sections you will ever see. With
very few exceptions, they are lined by a simple squamous epithelium. The
individual epithelial cells are extremely flattened and form a much larger part
of the surface than individual cells in cuboidal or columnar epithelia. The
nuclei of the squamous epithelial cells are also
flattened and often stain darkly. Not every epithelial
cell nucleus will be included in the plane of the
section, and if the vessel is very small (e.g. a
capillary), there may not be any visible nuclei in the
epithelial lining.
Capillaries and other small vessels are easily
deformed during tissue processing, and the
epithelium of larger vessels may be damaged or look
corrugated. It may therefore take a little more
patience than you expect to find a "good" simple
squamous epithelium.
Duodenum, H&E
The small intestines are lined by a simple
columnar epithelium. Most of the epithelial
cells (enterocytes) are involved in the
absorption of components of the digested
food in the lumen of the intestines. Complex
folds of the intestinal lining increase the
surface area available for absorption. The
plane of the section will therefore often pass
at an oblique angle through the epithelium.
The epithelium may look stratified where this
happens.

Mucus producing goblet cells are a second
cell type of this epithelium. Mucus stains
2

only weakly or not at all in H&E stained sections. Round, light "hollows" in
the epithelium represent the apical cytoplasm of the goblet cells, which is
filled with mucin-containing secretory vesicles.
Oesophagus H&E
Stratified squamous epithelium
•

The deepest cells, which are in contact with the
basement membrane, are cuboidal or columnar in
shape (basal layer).

•

At the surface of the epithelium, cells appear like flat
scales - similar to the epithelial cells of simple
squamous epithelia.

•

The shape of the cells that form the surface of the
epithelium gives the name to the epithelium.
Keratinised epithelium
•
Most apical layers (exterior) of cells
are dead and lose their nucleus and
cytoplasm, instead contain a tough, resistant
protein called keratin.
•
This specialization makes the
epithelium waterproof, so is found in the
mammalian skin

Pseudostratified and transitional epithelia
•

These two types of epithelia are difficult to classify using the shape of the
cells in the surface layer and the number of the cell layers as criteria.

•

Transitional epithelium is found exclusively in the excretory urinary
passages (including the ureter and the urinary bladder).

Transitional epithelium
•

The shape of the cells in the surface layer of a transitional epithelium varies
with the degree of distension of the organ with a lumen lined by this type of
epithelium. In the 'relaxed' state of the epithelium, it seems to be formed by
many cell layers. The most basal cells have a cuboidal or columnar shape.
There are several layers of polyhedral cells, and, finally, a layer of
superficial cells, which have a convex, dome-shaped luminal surface. In the
distended state of the epithelium, only one or two layers of cuboidal cells
are covered by a superficial layer of large, low cuboidal or squamous cells;
the epithelium will resemble a stratified squamous epithelium.

Pseudostratified columnar epithelium
All cells of this type of epithelium are in contact with the basement
membrane, but not all of them reach the surface of the epithelium. Nuclei of
the epithelial cells are typically located in the widest part of the cell.
Consequently, the nuclei of cells which do or do not reach the surface of the
epithelium are often located at different heights within the epithelium and
give the epithelium a stratified appearance. The epithelium will look
stratified but it is not - hence its name "pseudostratified". Pseudostratified
columnar epithelia are found in the excretory ducts of many glands.

Surface characteristics
Epithelial cells have three distinct surfaces
1. Basal surface – rests on the basement membrane
2. Lateral (or contact) surface – in contact with neighbouring epithelial cells
3. Apical (or free) surface
Basement membrane
• Epithelia are separated from the underlying connective tissue by an
extracellular supporting layer called the basement membrane.
• Membrane proteins of the epithelial cells are anchored in the basement
membrane, which is produced by the epithelial cells.
• In addition to its function as support of the epithelium, the basement
membrane acts as a selectively permeable filter between epithelium and
connective tissue.
Apical surface modifications
•
•
•
•

Microvilli and stereocilia:
Non-motile finger- or thread-shaped extensions of epithelial cells.
Their main function is to increase the surface area of cells active in
absorption.
Microvilli are much shorter than stereocilia.
Cilia:
Motile structures that beat in a synchronous manner to move material across
epithelial surfaces.

Lateral surface modifications
Junctional complexes
•

Occluding type
•

•

•

Tight junctions (= zonulae occludens), connects adjacent cells; close
to the apical surface

Adhering type
•

Desmosomes (maculae adherens) and zonulae adherens anchor cells
to each other; connected to the cytoskeleton

•

Hemidesmosomes connect cells to the basement membrane

Communicating type
•

Gap junction (nexus), allows movement of small molecules from one
cell to an adjacent cell

Glandular epithelia
Glands
•

Cells or aggregations of cells that function to secrete.

Exocrine glands release the secretory product (e.g. milk, mucus, sweat)
via a system of ducts that open onto of the surfaces of the body which are in
contact with the external world (skin, respiratory tract, etc).
Endocrine glands release their secretory product (typically hormones) into the
spaces between the secretory cells (extracellular space) from which it enters
the bloodstream.
Copyright © University of Melbourne

Both endocrine and exocrine glands are developmentally derived from epithelia that
grow into the underlying connective tissue, then develop the special characteristics
of the mature gland. Exocrine glands maintain the connection with the surface
epithelium, whereas the connection is lost by endocrine glands.
Classification of glands
Glands are classified anatomically based on the shape of their secretory units and
the complexity of their duct system

Type of secretion
•

Mucous product: viscous
secretion, made from mucin and H2O
•

Serous product: thin, aqueous
secretion, containing various enzymes
•

Mixed product: mixed
mucous/serous secretion

Compendium of Histology pp 101-120

Method of secretion
•

Merocrine secretion corresponds to the process of exocytosis. Vesicles open
onto the surface of the cell, and the secretory product is discharged from the
cell without any further loss of cell substance.

•

Apocrine secretion is a mechanism in which part of the apical cytoplasm of
the cells is lost together with the secretory product. The continuity of the
plasma membrane is restored by the fusion of the broken edges of the
membrane, and the cell is able to accumulate the secretory product anew.
This mechanism is used by apocrine sweat glands, the mammary glands and
the prostate.

•

Holocrine secretion designates the breakdown and discharge of the entire
secretory cell. It is only seen in the sebaceous glands of the skin.

Smooth muscle

Smooth muscle

• Two broad types of smooth muscle
1. Multiunit
2. Visceral

• Multiunit type
– functionally independent smooth muscle cells which
are often innervated by a single nerve terminal and
which never contract spontaneously
– smooth muscle in the walls of large blood vessels,
the eyes and hair follicles

• Visceral type
– represents bundles of smooth muscle cells
connected by GAP junctions, which contract
spontaneously if stretched beyond a certain limit
– smooth muscle in the walls of the intestines or
uterus.

Skeletal Muscle
• Skeletal muscle consists of very long tubular cells, which are also called
muscle fibres.
– The average length of skeletal muscle cells in humans is about 3 cm (stapedius muscle
only about 1 mm, sartorius muscle up to 30 cm). Their diameters vary from 10 to 100 µm.

• Skeletal muscle fibres contain many peripherally placed nuclei.
Up to several hundred rather small nuclei with 1 or 2 nucleoli are located just
beneath the plasma membrane.
• Skeletal muscle fibres show in many preparations characteristic crossstriations.
• Skeletal muscle is innervated by the somatic nervous system.
• Skeletal muscle makes up the voluntary muscle.

Type I (slow) fibres

-

Type II (fast) fibres

Energy production
- Type I (slow oxidative) fibres
- Type IIA (fast-oxidative) fibres

- Type IIB/ IIx (fast –glycolytic) fibres

Muscle Fibre Types
Type I (slow – oxidative) fibre
• Predominantly red muscle cells.

• Comparatively thin
• Contains large amounts of myoglobin
and mitochondria.

• myosin with low ATPase activity
• Contraction is slow and sustained.
e.g. in the control of posture.
• Relatively resistant to fatigue

Muscle Fibre Types
Type IIA (fast – oxidative) fibre
• Predominantly found in red muscles
• Thicker fibres
• Contains large amounts of
myoglobin and many mitochondria.
• ATPase activity of the myosin
isoform is high and contraction is
fast.

Muscle Fibre Types
Type IIB (fast – glycolytic) fibre
• Predominantly found in white
muscles
• Thicker and contain little
myoglobin.
• ATPase activity of the myosin
isoform in white fibres is high,
and contraction is fast.

• Type IIB/IIX fibres contain only
few mitochondria.
• usually prone to fatigue

Muscle Spindles
• Muscle spindles are sensory
specialization of the muscular
tissue.
• A number of small specialised
intrafusal muscle fibres (nuclear
bag fibres and nuclear chain
fibres) are surrounded by a
capsule of connective tissue.

Muscle Spindles
• If the muscle is stretched, the muscle
fibres in the muscle spindle are
stretched, sensory nerves are
stimulated, and a change in contraction
of the muscle is perceived.
• Different types of intrafusal fibres and
nerve endings allow the perception of
position, velocity and acceleration of the
contraction of the muscle.

Cardiac Muscle
• Cardiac muscle, the myocardium, consists of muscle cells, cardiomyocytes, with
one centrally placed nucleus.
Nuclei are oval, rather pale and located centrally in the muscle cell which is 10 15 µm wide.
• Cardiac muscle cells exhibit cross-striations.
• Cardiac muscle cells excitation is mediated by rhythmically active modified
cardiac muscle cells.
• Cardiac muscle is innervated by the autonomic nervous system, which adjusts
the force generated by the muscle cells and the frequency of the heart beat.
• Cardiac muscle is for these reasons also called involuntary striated muscle.

Cardiac muscle
• Often branch at acute angles and are connected to each
other by specialisations of the cell membrane in the region
of the intercalated discs.
• Intercalated discs invariably occur at the ends of cardiac
muscle cells in a region corresponding to the Z-line of the
myofibrils (the last Z-line of the myofibril within the cell is
"replaced" by the intercalated disk of the cell membrane).

Cardiac Muscle

Junctions in the Intercalated disks
• Fascia adherens
• Anchor actin to nearest sarcomere

• Macula adherens
• desmosome
• Stop separation during contraction

• Gap junctions
• Allow action potentials to spread between cells

Intercalated Disk

Purkinje fibres
• Conduct stimuli faster than ordinary
cardiac muscle cells (2-3 m/s vs. 0.6 m/s).

• A bundle of Purkinje fibres extends from
the atrioventricular node, pierces the
fibrous body, divides into left and right
bundles, and travels, beneath the
endocardium, towards the tip (apex) of the
heart.
• Branches of the bundle contact ordinary
cardiac muscle cells by way of
specialisations similar to intercalated discs.
• Purkinje fibres are thicker than ordinary
cardiac muscle cells.

Central Nervous System
Brain and spinal cord
Two major classes of cells
• Neurones (nerve cells)

nucleolus.
• Cytoplasm of many neurones contains
aggregates of rough endoplasmic
reticulum (Nissl bodies).
• Prominent in motor neurones in the
ventral horn of the grey matter of the
spinal cord.
• The size of the perikaryon depends on the
level of activity of the neurone and the
length of the processes which the
neurone has to support.

Neurones

Neuroglia

• Star shaped cells
• Processes often in contact
with blood vessels
• Mechanical and metabolic

• It consists of:
• groups of neurones (ganglion cells),
called ganglia,

• feltworks of nerve fibres, called
plexuses, and
• bundles of parallel nerve fibres that
form the nerves and nerve roots.

Peripheral Nervous System
• Nerve fibres, which originate from
neurones within the CNS and
pass out of the CNS in cranial
and spinal nerves, are called
efferent or motor fibres.
• Nerve fibres which originate from
nerve cells outside the CNS but
enter the CNS by way of the
cranial or spinal nerves are called
afferent or sensory nerve fibres.

Schwann cells
• Nerve fibre. Axon and its nerve sheath.
• Sheath of Schwann cells.
• Schwann cells form a sheath around one
axon and surround this axon with several
double layers (up to hundreds) of cell
membrane.
• Insulates the axon, improves its ability to
conduct.

Ganglion
• A ganglion is an aggregate of
nerve cells (ganglion cells) outside
the CNS
• Individual ganglion cells are
surrounded by a layer of flattened
satellite cells.

LECTURE OVERVIEW
LECTURE NOTES
Anatomy is the study of the structure - the form, relations, and arrangement of tissues and organs, and function resulting
from these relations. Knowledge of anatomy is essential to veterinary medicine. It is required for examining animals to
determine what is normal and what is abnormal. It is required to accurately and safely take samples of blood or tissues for
diagnosis. It is needed for surgery and injections of medication, and much more.

The word ‘anatomy’ derives from an ancient Greek word meaning ‘to cut’. Now, as in ancient Greece, dissection is a crucial
part of learning anatomy. To make anatomy easier to learn, it can be divided into gross anatomy (visible structures) and
histology (microscopic structures). Anatomy can also be divided into body systems or only consider anatomy present in a
particular body region.

Anatomy gives names to all structures of the body and the many parts within these structures, as well as their positions and
relationships. These names can be used to describe what you see and to follow written descriptions. Prior to 1985, many
languages had their own terminology for each structure. This made it very difficult for clinicians and researchers around the
world to communicate, as some structures had more than 10 different names. To remove ambiguity and improve clarity,
veterinary anatomical language was internationally standardised.

The definitive list of veterinary anatomical names is found in the Nomina Anatomica Veterinaria (NAV, current revision 6th
edition 2017), as well as the guidelines which dictate the accepted names.
The names in the NAV must follow these guidelines:
1.

Aside from a very limited number of exceptions, each anatomical concept should be designated by a single term.

2.

Each term should be in Latin in the official list, but the anatomists of each country are free to translate the official
Latin terms into the language of instruction.

3.

Each term should be as short and simple as possible.

4.

The terms should be easy to remember and should have, above all, instructive and descriptive value.

5.

Structures that are closely related topographically should have similar names. For example, Arteria femoralis, Vena
femoralis, Nervus femoralis.

6.

Differentiating adjectives should generally be opposites, as major and minor, superficialis and profundus.

7.

Terms derived from proper names (eponyms) should not be used.

To summarise these guidelines, the term used to describe an anatomical structure is in Latin (or the local language
translation), is short, simple, easy to remember, descriptive and instructive, and is the only term for this structure
(ideally). If differentiating adjectives are used for two or more structures, they should be opposite. Structures closely
related in their anatomical position should have similar names.

While the names used in veterinary anatomical structures or concepts are derived from many languages, the majority are
derived from ancient Greek or Latin. Becoming familiar with the translations for frequently used medical words (in particular
commonly used prefixes, suffixes, or tissue names) will usually help bring meaning and comprehension to the sea of new
words you will encounter in the coming years. You do not need to know which language the words come from, but the origin
of some words has been included below for your interest (Gr = Greek, L = Latin).

The point of learning anatomical names and terms is to use them to communicate, so they are only useful if you can be correct
in your use of these words. Like any language, this will require practice. Use anatomical terms when asking questions and
practice describing the positions of structures to your fellow students. Translating anatomical descriptions into lay
terminology will assist you in developing ways of communicating to clients as well as improving your understanding of the
terminology.

DIRECTIONAL TERMS:
Being able to describe a structure, its relationship to structures nearby, and its function are much more important than
being able to name the structure. Identification of a structure is possible using just position terms and a general
descriptive term such as bone, muscle, tendon, ligament, nerve, vessel (or more specifically artery or vein), lymph node,
and organ, as long as you can relate that structure to something that is more accurately identifiable. To describe the
position and the tissue, you will need a bank of descriptive words.

Terms to describe direction in veterinary science are based on an upright, plantigrade (feet flat on the ground) stance.

From: Dyce, Sack & Wensing’s Textbook of Veterinary Anatomy (4th ed).

The correct terms for describing anatomy of an animal are:
•

Left and right (from the animal’s perspective)

•

Dorsal – towards the animal’s back or ‘dorsum’

•

Ventral – towards the animal’s belly or ‘ventrum’

•

Proximal (limbs and tail) – towards the junction to the body

•

Distal (limbs and tail) – away from the junction to the body

•

Cranial – towards the head (cranium, Gr = head)

•

Caudal – towards the tail (cauda, L = tail)

•

Medial – towards the ‘centre’ or ‘middle’ of the body, towards the median plane (see below)

•

Lateral – towards the flank or side of the body, away from the median plane

•

Superficial – towards the surface of the body

•

Deep – away from the surface of the body

•

External – towards or in the surface of the body

•

Internal/inner – away from the surface of the body

For the carpus, tarsus, and all structures distal to these joints:
•

Dorsal – the side of the distal limbs away from the ground, towards the dorsum

•

Palmar – the ‘palm’, the side of the distal forelimb in contact with the ground

•

Plantar - the side of the distal hindlimb in contact with the ground

For the digits:
•

Axial – towards the central axis of the limb

•

Abaxial (ab – L – away) – away the central axis of the limb

For the head:
•

Rostral – towards the nose or ‘rostrum’

•

All other directional terms are the same i.e. dorsal and ventral, medial and lateral, superficial and deep, internal
and external.

•

Some features of the eyes and ears are the only structures where the human terms ‘anterior’, ‘posterior’,
‘superior’, and ‘inferior’ are applicable in veterinary anatomy.

BODY PLANES:
The planes of the body are 2-dimensional slices through the 3-dimensional body, which allows the body to be divided
into different sections or allows us to view the arrangement of tissues in a certain slice. Understanding body planes is
central to interpreting ultrasound, CT scans and MRI diagnostic images.
•

Median plane – through the ‘centre’ or ‘middle’ of the body, creating equal left and right halves of the body.

•

Sagittal plane – parallel to the median plane, dividing the body into unequal left and right parts.

•

Transverse plane – through the body or limb at right angles to the long axis, creating cranial and caudal parts
(on the body) or proximal and distal parts (on the limbs).

•

Dorsal plane – through the body at right angles to both median and transverse planes, dividing the body into
dorsal and ventral parts.

ASPECTS:
Aspects or views are used to communicate from what direction you are observing the animal. The name of the aspect you are
viewing is the part of the animal closest to you (or the camera in an image). The aspect is named using the directional terms
outlined above e.g. cranial aspect if you are viewing the front of the animal and it’s cranium is closest to you.
The view might be angled and thus the description of the aspect will be a combination of two adjacent directions. For
example, the horse in the directions diagram above is viewed from the craniolateral aspect.

JOINT MOVEMENT:
We also need words to describe how a joint is moving. For this, we use the long axis of the limb as reference and determine if
the angle between the two bones of a joint is getting smaller or increasing compared to this straight line.

•

Flexion (L – to bend) - the angle between the bones at a joint becomes smaller.

•

Extension (L – stretch out) - the angle between the bones at a joint approaches 180o (approaches the straight line of
the limb axis)

•

Hyperextension - a joint travels beyond 180o straight line of the limb axis in a continuation of the extension
movement.
o

•

Adduction – joint movement such that a limb moves towards the midline of the body
o

•

‘hyper’ (Gr – over) + ‘extension’ (L - stretch out)

‘ad’ (L – toward) + ‘duction’ (L – bringing)

Abduction – joint movement such that a limb moves away from the midline of the body
o

‘ab’ (L – away) + ‘duction’ (L – bringing)

•

Pronation – rotation of the manus (‘hand’) or pes (‘foot’) so the palmar/plantar surface turns toward the ground
o

•

‘pronate’ (L – lying face down)

Supination – rotation of the manus (‘hand’) or pes (‘foot’) so the dorsal surface turns toward the ground
o

‘supinate’ (L - lay on the back)

Supination

Pronation

BUILDING A PICTURE OF THE BODY IN YOUR MIND :
If you identify the relative position and type of structure yourself whenever you encounter a new name, then you will be
creating meaning for yourself in association with that word. In time, and with a great deal of practice, you will be able to build
a complete picture of the body in this way.
It is much more important to be able to build this mental “picture”, than to remember the precise name of a specific structure.
From such a mental picture, you may deduce a lot about the function of specific structures and hence develop ideas of how to
approach problems that you may encounter in clinical practice. You will also be able to find the correct name from a textbook
if you can follow a description in detail.

Intended Learning Outcomes
At the end of this lecture, you should be able to:
• Describe the position, relationships, form, and
appearance of important animal structures and

features
• Apply correct terminology for normal and novel
structures in a meaningful way

What is anatomy?
•

Anatomy is the study of the structure - the form, relations, and arrangement of tissues and organs, and function
resulting from these relations.

•

‘Anatomy’ comes from ancient Greek, meaning ‘to cut’
− Dissection is still a crucial part of learning anatomy

•

Many ways to categorize anatomy for ease of study
e.g. gross (visible) vs histology (microscopic)
e.g. systemic (by body system) vs regional (by body region)

Why is anatomy important?
• You will use it every day in clinical practice
- Animal examination and diagnosis – knowing what’s normal to determine abnormal
- Need anatomy to safely and accurately take diagnostic samples, take blood samples
- Treatment – anatomy is crucial for safe and successful surgical procedures
- Need anatomy to give injections of medication

The language of anatomy
•

Anatomy gives names to all structures of the body and the
many parts within these structures, as well as their
positions and relationships.

• Until 1895, many languages had their own terminology
for the structures discovered
− Very confusing!!

The language of anatomy
• To remove ambiguity, anatomical language has been internationally standardised
•

Facilitates clear communication
– Between colleagues verbally
– From written text e.g. textbooks, clinical case notes.

• Nomina Anatomica Veterinaria (NAV), current revision 6th edition (2017)
–

Nomina Embryologica Veterinaria and Nomica Histologica Veterinaria also available
• Guidelines that decide the name for an anatomical structure or concept (with the occasional exception):
– the only term for this structure
– in Latin (or the local language translation)
– short, simple, easy to remember, descriptive and instructive
– if differentiating adjectives are used for two or more structures, they are opposite e.g. superficial and deep
– structures closely related in their anatomical position have similar names e.g. femoral nerve, artery and vein

The language of anatomy
• The words of veterinary anatomy come from many languages
• Most are from Ancient Greek (Gr) or Latin (L)
• Try to learn what common prefixes, suffixes, and root words mean
• Breaking down new words into their parts usually helps understand and remember them
• E.g. hypothermia

‘hypo-’ = below (Gr)
‘-thermia’ = heat (Gr)

Directional terms
This is up
Or is this up?

• Everyday terms can lead to confusion, depending on how the animal or observer is positioned.

• Standardized anatomical language uses directional terms relative to the animal’s body.
• Still use left and right.
− Remember, this is the animal’s left or right.

From: Dyce, Sack & Wensing’s Textbook
of Veterinary Anatomy (4th ed).

Veterinary position terms are based on an upright, plantigrade stance.

Directional terms
Dorsal (dorsalis in Latin, = back)
- closer to the back, also known as the dorsum

Dorsal

Ventral (ventralis in Latin, = belly)
- closer to the belly, also known as the ventrum
• applies to the entire body, expect for the limbs.
Ways to use dorsal and ventral:
e.g. the dorsal midline is the line that runs along the centre of
the back, also known as the dorsum, shown in green.
e.g. the ventral midline is the line that runs along the centre of
the back, also known as the ventrum , shown in purple.
e.g. the heart is located ventral to the two large veins of the
body, the cranial and caudal vena cava (who’s names are
explained more on future slides).

Ventral

Directional terms
Proximal (proximalis in Latin)
- closer to the junction of
the limb to the body
• applies to the limbs and tail.

Distal (distalis in Latin)
- away from the junction
the limb to the body
Proximal femoral artery

elbow

Distal femoral artery

Proximal

Ways to use proximal and distal:
e.g. the proximal femoral artery is a blood vessel that leaves
the major artery in the hindleg closer to the body compared to
the distal femoral artery, which leaves the major hindleg artery
further away from the body.
e.g. the toes are distal to the elbow in the forelimb
e.g. as you move proximally through the forelimb from the toes,
you first encounter the carpus (‘wrist’), then the elbow.
e.g. the dog has a cut in the skin on the distal third of their
antebrachium (‘forearm’).

Proximal

Middle

Directional terms
Cranial (cranialis in Latin) Caudal (caudalis in Latin)
(cranium = head, Gr)
(cauda = tail, L)
- closer to the head
- closer to the tail

Cranial
Caudal

• applies to the neck and trunk & to the limbs
proximal to the carpus (‘wrist’) and tarsus (‘ankle’).
Ways to use cranial and caudal:
e.g. the cranial vena cava is cranial to the heart.
e.g. the caudal vena cava is caudal to the heart.
e.g. as you move cranially through the body from the tail, you will
first encounter the caudal vena cava, then the heart, then the
cranial vena cava.

tarsus
carpus

Directional terms for the distal limbs
Dorsal (dorsalis in Latin)
Palmar (palmaris in Latin) – forelegs only, ‘palm’
Plantar (plantaris in Latin) – hindlegs only
• dorsal and palmar is used for the carpus and
everything distal to it in the forelimb
• dorsal and plantar is used for the tarsus and
everything distal to it in the hindlimb
Ways to use dorsal, palmar, and plantar:
e.g. the digital pads are found on the palmar and plantar
Plantar
surfaces of the forelimbs and hindlimbs respectively.
e.g. the dog has a cut in the skin on the dorsal surface of
Digital pads
the carpus.

- closer to the median plane (the ‘centre’
or ‘middle’ of the body)
Lateral (lateralis in Latin)
- closer to the side or flank of the body

Medial
Lateral

For digits

OR

• applies to the whole body
Median
plane

Ways to use medial and lateral:
e.g. the hindlimbs are located lateral to the udder of a cow
e.g. the first digit (dewclaw) is on the medial side of the limb
e.g. the fifth digit is on the lateral side of the limb
Special terms for sides of digits (other than the horse)

Superficial (superficialis in Latin)
- closer to the surface of the skin
Deep (profundus in Latin)
- closer to the ‘centre’ of the body or limb, or further
away from the skin surface
Internal/inner and external are also used to describe
a structure based on proximity to the body surface
• applies to the entire body.

Deep

Superficial

e.g. the deep gluteal muscle is located next to the pelvis bone
under several layers of tissue, while the superficial gluteal
muscle is closer to the skin.
e.g. the external ear is seen on the skin surface, while the
inner ear is located within the skull.
e.g. the internal obturator muscle is located on the inside
of the pelvis, and the external obturator muscle is on the
outside of the pelvis.

Internal

External

From: Goody. Dog Anatomy (2nd ed).

Directional terms for the head
Rostral (rostralis in Latin)
- closer to the nose (‘rostrum’)

Caudal (caudalis in Latin)
- closer to the tail

Caudal

Dorsal and ventral, medial and lateral, superficial and
deep, internal and external used on head, same meanings
as rest of body.

Some eye and ear structures are the only place ‘human’
terms (anterior, posterior, superior, and inferior)
apply in veterinary anatomy
Ways to use rostral and caudal in the head:
e.g. the whiskers are found more rostrally on the
head compared to the eye.
e.g. the nose is the most rostral body part of the dog.
e.g. as you move caudally on the head of a dog from the nose, you
will encounter the eye, then the ear.

Aspects
•

Aspects or views are used to communicate
from what direction you are observing the
animal

•

The name of the aspect you are viewing is
the part of the animal closest to you (or
the camera)

e.g. when a dog rolls over onto their back, you
are looking at their ventral aspect.
•

The view might be angled
• Thus the aspect is a combination of two
adjacent aspects
e.g. craniolateral, caudolateral, etc.

e.g. if you were viewing a digit on an angle

Supination

•

Pronation

Pronation – rotation of the manus (‘hand’) or pes (‘foot’) so the palmar/plantar surface turns
toward the ground; (Latin - ‘pronate’ = lying face down)
hint: think the palm is turning towards the ground

•

Supination – rotation of the manus (‘hand’) or pes (‘foot’) so the dorsal surface turns toward
the ground; (Latin - ‘supinate’ = lay on the back)
hint: think the palm is turning towards upwards and can now hold some ‘soup’!

Example
The cephalic vein crosses the palmar side of the distal third of the third and fourth
metacarpal bones.
It then courses proximally on the palmar side of the interosseous muscles and
passes superficial to the flexor retinaculum parallel to the carpal canal.

It then runs medially to the cranial surface of the antebrachium where it joins the
accessory cephalic vein and continues proximally on the cranial surface of the
extensor carpi radialis muscle to the flexor angle of the elbow joint.

Example
• The cephalic (L – pertaining to the head) vein crosses the palmar side of the distal third of the third
and fourth metacarpal (meta = after + carpal – pertaining to the carpus (Gr wrist)) bones.
• It then courses proximally on the palmar side of the interosseous (inter = between + osseous –
pertaining to bones) muscles and passes superficial to the flexor (L – flex = bent) retinaculum (L – a
rope cable) parallel to the carpal canal.

• It then runs medially to the cranial surface of the antebrachium (ante = before + brachium L/Gr – arm)
where it joins the accessory cephalic vein and continues proximally on the cranial surface of the
extensor (L – extend = stretch out) carpi radialis (L – pertaining to the radius) muscle to the flexor
angle of the elbow joint.

LECTURE 6
THE SKELETON
LECTURER
DR JANINE HOFMANN
Email: hofmann.j@unimelb.edu.au

INTENDED LEARNING OUTCOMES
At the end of this lecture, you should be able to:
-

-

Describe the position, relationships, form, and appearance of the major bones of the quadruped skeleton,
information used to understand the skeleton scaffold within the body, radiography, and as landmarks during clinical
procedures.
Identify the major bones in novel animals, as not all animals treated by veterinarians will be domestic species.

KEY WORDS
-

Axial skeleton: skull, mandible, hyoid, vertebral column (cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral, caudal vertebrae), thoracic
skeleton (thoracic vertebrae, ribs, sternum).
Appendicular skeleton: bones of the forelimb and hindlimb.
Bones of the forelimb: pectoral girdle (scapula, clavicle, coracoid), humerus, radius and ulna, carpal bones,
metacarpal bones, digits (phalanges).
Bones of the hindlimb: pelvic girdle (ilium, ischium, pubis, acetabulum), femur, tibia and fibula, tarsal bones,
metatarsal bones, digits (phalanges).
Features on bones: process, tuberosity, epicondyle; fossa, foramen, fissure, canal, duct, condyle, articular facet.
Specialised bones: sesamoids, splanchnic bones, pneumatic bones.

LECTURE NOTES
The skeleton serves to support the body and provide its basic shape, as well as anchor the leverage system used for locomotion
and provide protection to delicate structures.
We use the dog as a ‘universal plan’ in this course as their skeleton contains nearly all the bones you would find in domestic
species. From this universal plan, the name and function of a bone in an unfamiliar species can be deduced from careful
observation and extrapolating from the basic quadruped skeletal plan using the relative positions and relationships which are
almost always conserved.

AXIAL SKELETON

Image by Dr Helen Davies
Skull
The skull is formed by the interlocking of many bones. The joints between these bones are fibrous ‘sutures’ which are flexible
when the animal is young and growing but with age, the sutures fill with bone to form a single structural unit. The skull is
bilaterally symmetrical - that is, when cut along the median plane, the left and right sides contain the same structures. All the
unpaired bones are located on the midline, and while unpaired, their left and right parts are mirror images.
Paired (left and right):
• Incisive
• Nasal
• Maxillary
• Lacrimal
• Frontal
• Parietal
• Temporal (squamous, petrosal, tympanic)
• Palatine
• Pterygoid
• Zygomatic
Unpaired (single bone on midline):
• Occipital
• Sphenoid complex
o basisphenoid
o presphenoid
• Vomer
• Ethmoid
Mandible
The mandible is formed by two mirrored bones that meet at the intermandibular joint.
The teeth found in the skull and mandible reflect the diet of the animal and are useful in the deduction of the type of animal
skeleton being observed.

Hyoid
The hyoid is a complex of 9 bones which suspends the tongue, larynx, and pharynx from the skull and supports the tongue by
connecting it to the larynx. The joints between the bones varies between species, or even within species. They are commonly
synovial joints but can also be fibrocartilage or fused by bone.
They hyoid can be divided into 2 parts. The ‘suspensory apparatus’ consists of the hyoid components connecting the tongue to
the tympanic region of the skull (the tympanohyoid cartilage, stylohyoid, epihyoid, ceratohyoid and basihyoid bones).
The ‘hyoid apparatus’ (equivalent to the human hyoid bone) consists of the basihyoid and thyrohyoid bones that connect the
tongue to the larynx.
Vertebral column
The vertebral column, or the ‘spine’, runs from the skull to the most caudal tip of the body. The column is composed of individual
vertebrae (vertebrae = plural, vertebra = singular) which interconnect in a complex arrangement to allow all the movements
required for the central axis of the body.
The vertebral column is divided into regions based on their location in the body:
• Cervical (C) – in the neck
• Thoracic (T) – in the thorax/chest; all thoracic vertebra articulate with ribs
• Lumbar (L) – in the lumbar region, above the abdomen
• Sacral (S) – articulate with the pelvis
• Caudal (Ca) – in the ‘cauda’ or tail

The shape of the first two cervical vertebra has evolved to provide specialised functions to these vertebrae. The first cervical
vertebra – C1 – is broad and flat, and articulated with the caudal skull in a manner that only allowed flexion and extension. In
other words, the ‘atlantooccipital’ joint only allows the skull to move in a dorsal and ventral direction, producing the nodding or
‘yes’ head motion. Because C1 is holding up the body’s important control centre, it is also termed ‘atlas’ after the Greek god Atlas
who holds up the world.
The joint between C1 and C2 only allows rotation, allowing the head to shake or make the ‘no’ head motion. Reflecting this, C2 is
also termed ‘axis’ as it is the bone around which the head rotates.

Thoracic skeleton
The thoracic skeleton, or ‘ribcage’, consists of the thoracic vertebrae, ribs, and sternum. The ribs are long, slender bones that
wrap around the lateral sides of the thorax dorsally to ventrally. All ribs articulate with thoracic vertebra, however, only some
articular with the sternum (sternal ribs), others join to other ribs (asternal ribs) and sometimes the last rib is not attached at all
ventrally (floating rib). The sternum is a complex of 8 bones, that is fused in some species. The individual bones are referred to as
sternebrae. The first sternebra has a special name, the manubrium, as does the 8th sternebra, the xiphoid process which is
extended further caudally by a xiphoid cartilage.

Digits

A ‘girdle’ is the structures which connect a limb to the main axial skeleton. The forelimb developed from the front fin – or pectoral
fin, the one closest to the head – so you will see the term pectoral limb used in sometimes. Where we do use the term pectoral
commonly is in relation to the structures involved in the forelimb ‘girdle’.
In the ‘universal’ plan, there are three bones in the pectoral girdle – the girdle which connects the limb which developed from the
pectoral fin – to the body. The coracoid and clavicle (when present) articulate with both the scapula and the sternum. By
contrast, the scapula is attached to the trunk by muscles which create a ‘sling’ in which the body cradles.

Naming of both the distal forelimb and hindlimb is simplified to a numbering system which begins on the medial side (where our
thumbs are located). Hence, the distal row of carpal and tarsal bones, the metacarpals/metatarsals, and the digits are all
numbered in this way. The phalanges within a digit are numbered from proximally to distally. That is, phalanx 1 articulates with
the metacarpus/metatarsus, phalanx 3 is most distal, and phalanx 2 in between. This numbering system is consistently applied
across all species.
Forelimb joints
• Shoulder joint – between scapula and humerus
• Elbow joint – between humerus, ulna and radius
• Carpal joint – any joint that involved carpal bones
o Radiocarpal joint – between radius and proximal carpal bones
o Middle carpal joint – between proximal (1st row) and distal (2nd row) carpal bones
o Carpometacarpal joint – between distal carpal bones and metacarpals
• Metacarpophalangeal joints – between metacarpal and phalanx 1 in each respective digit
• Interphalangeal joints – between phalanges
o Proximal interphalangeal joint – between phalanx 1 and 2
o Distal interphalangeal joint – between phalanx 2 and 3

The term ‘pelvis’ specifically refers to the pelvis girdle and the sacrum together. It is worth noting that in common use, pelvis is
more often used to refer to the hip bones alone.

Hindlimb joints
• Sacroiliac joint – between sacrum and hip bone (specifically the ilium)
• Hip joint – between hip bone and femur
• Stifle joint
o Femorotibial joint – between femur and tibia, the weightbearing joint of the stifle
o Femoropatella joint – between femur and patella
• Tarsal joint – any joint that involved tarsal bones
o Tibiotarsal joint – between tibia and 1st row of tarsal bones
o Proximal tarsal joint – between 1st and 2nd row of tarsal bones
o Distal tarsal joint – between 2nd and 3rd row of tarsal bones
o Tarsometatarsal joint – between 3rd row of tarsal bones and metatarsals
• Metatarsophalangeal joints – between metatarsal and phalanx 1 in each respective digit
• Interphalangeal joints – same as forelimb
o Proximal interphalangeal joint
o Distal interphalangeal joint

Features on bones
The many lumps, bumps, holes, and dints of the bones have been given names if they are consistently found throughout a
species. There are many terms used to describe these bone features, some of which are:
• Condyle – any articular surface
• Epicondyle – an enlarged bony feature next to or near a condyle, notably the distal humerus
• Head – a condyle which has a ball or ‘head’ like shape, notably the proximal humerus and femur
• Articular facet – generally used for articular surfaces on the vertebra
• Tuberosity – a large protrusion from a bone surface
• Tubercule – a tuberosity on the proximal forelimb
• Trochanter – a tuberosity on the proximal hindlimb
• Process – a more long and pointy protrusion, notably on vertebra
• Fossa – an indentation in a bone
• Cavity – a large fossa
• Foramen – a hole in a bone, large or small
• Fissure – a gap in a bone, notably in the skull
• Canal – a tubular hole through a bone, usually carrying a structure e.g. nerve, blood vessel
• Duct – a longer canal, often carrying a duct structure.

Specialised bones
Sesamoids are bones that have formed usually within tendons that are subjected to frequent large stresses to improve their
durability. The largest sesamoid in the body is the patella, or ‘kneecap’. There are several other sesamoids around the stifle
joint and they ae plentiful in the distal limbs.
Splanchnic bones are found within soft tissues not involved in locomotion or weightbearing. At this point in time, splanchnic
bones have been discovered in the heart (os cordis), the penis (os penis) and the snout of pigs (os rosti).
Birds have specialised pneumatic bones to assist them in flight. The core of these bones has been removed and left to empty,
thus lightening their overall body weight. Some pneumatic bones are connected to the airways of birds, increasing their lung
capacity so to speak.

LECTURER
DR JANINE HOFMANN
Email: hofmann.j@unimelb.edu.au

INTENDED LEARNING OUTCOMES
At the end of this lecture, you should be able to:
Identify regions of the body by their anatomical name in domestic and novel species, necessary to communicate in a
meaningful way.
Describe the position and relationships of the major systems in relation to the major bones of the quadruped
skeleton and in relation to each other, so they can be found in any animal you are presented with.
Identify major structures of the major systems by their anatomical name and relative position, to facilitate
communication about these body systems.
Find selected structures from a written description and/or their anatomical name, a necessary skill in a veterinary
career, for example to follow instructions to perform a surgery.

KEY WORDS
-

Body regions: pectoral limb, pelvic limb, head, neck, thorax, abdomen, pelvis.
Body cavities: thoracic/abdominal/pelvic
Relationships of generalised body systems (musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, lymphatic, nervous, integument) and
body systems with a restricted range (respiratory, digestive, urinary, reproductive, endocrine).
Specific structures/organs: heart, aorta, carotid artery, jugular vein, cranial vena cava, caudal vena cava, portal vein,
brain, spinal cord, spleen, trachea, lungs, diaphragm, tongue, teeth, oesophagus, liver, stomach, intestines, kidneys,
bladder, male and female reproductive tract.

LECTURE NOTES
While the body can be studied by system to better understand function and dysfunction, systemic anatomy neglects how
these systems are arranged throughout the body and as a result how they will interact with similarly located structures from
other systems. As such, regional anatomy divides the body into smaller sections and examines the integrated systems that
function as a whole body.

REGIONAL ANATOMY
The main body regions are:
•

Head or cranial body region

•

Neck or cervical body region

•

Thorax or thoracic body region

•

Pectoral limb or forelimb body region

•

Lumbar body region

•

Abdomen or abdominal body region

•

Rump or gluteal body region

•

Pelvic limb or hindlimb body region

•

Tail or cauda body region

The pectoral limb or forelimb can be further subdivided into:
•

Shoulder or scapular region – containing the scapula

•

Brachium or brachial region – containing the humerus

•

Antebrachium or antebrachial region – containing the ulna and radius

•

Carpus or carpal region – containing the carpal bones

•

Metacarpus or metacarpal region – containing the metacarpal bones

•

Digits or digital region – containing the phalanges

•

Manus – the carpus, metacarpus, and digits.

The pelvic limb or hindlimb can be further subdivided into:
•

Rump or gluteal region – containing the pelvis and gluteal muscles

•

Thigh or femoral region – containing the femur

•

Crus or crural region – containing the tibia and fibula

•

Tarsus or tarsal region – containing the tarsal bones

•

Metatarsus or metatarsal region – containing the metatarsal bones

•

Digits or digital region – containing the phalanges

•

Pes – the tarsus, metatarsus, and digits.

Body cavities
The space inside the body can also be divided based on landmarks.
•

Thoracic cavity – cranial to the diaphragm

•

Abdominal cavity – caudal to the diaphragm and cranial to the pelvic inlet
o

•

The pelvic inlet is the space between the most cranial bony landmarks of the pelvic bone

Pelvic cavity – caudal to the pelvic inlet

Applying anatomical language
Some tips when using, applying, or reading the anatomical language given in the last three lectures:
1.

Work from the known to the unknown

2.

Terms based on Latin and Greek roots (see lecture 4 and the lists on Canvas)
•

Dissect words to determine their meaning

•

English also based on these roots, so some word parts will already be familiar

3.

Names mostly describe appearance, form, relative position, tissue and/or function

4.

Practice is required

SYSTEMIC ANATOMY

Generalised body systems
There are 5 generalised body systems, which means they are found in all regions of the body.

Musculoskeletal
The musculoskeletal system contains the bones, joints, muscles, tendons, ligaments, and fascia. The skeletal part of the
musculoskeletal system was looked at in some detail in lecture 5 of Cells to Systems. This skeleton provides the scaffold to
which the muscles and connective tissue structures attach. The muscles layer over this boney scaffold and fill out the
integument to provide most of what we recognise as the body shape. Tendons are dense, strong connective tissue structures
which connect muscles to bones, while ligaments are composed of similar material but typically connect bones to bones.
Fascia are sheets or bands of connective tissue found beneath the skin and around the muscles that attach the muscles to
each other and to nearby structures.

Integument
The haired skin covers all of the body and is continuous with the internal mucosal lining at the body openings. The digital
pads are highly modified skin structures, evolved to allow animals to run on rough ground without damaging their more
delicate haired skin. Other modified skin structures are the claws, and their further modification to hooves, on the most distal
ends of each digit, and the nasal plate on the most rostral end of the head surrounding the external nasal opening (external
nares).

Cardiovascular
The smallest tubes in the cardiovascular system, the capillaries, permeate every tissue in the body ensuring every cell is
supplied with oxygen and nutrients while removing their waste products.

Larger cardiovascular structures of importance are:
•

Heart – located in the midline of the cranioventral thorax, generally medial to the 3rd, 4th and 5th ribs

•

Aorta – the largest artery, running caudal from the heart in the dorsal thorax and abdomen

•

Carotid artery – the artery which runs cranially from the aorta in the ventrolateral neck to supply the brain with
oxygenated blood

•

Jugular vein – a large vein returning deoxygenated blood from the brain and head. It is also located in the
ventrolateral neck, but more ventral and more lateral than the carotid artery

•

Cranial vena cava – the jugular vein and the veins returning from the forelimbs combine to form the cranial vena
cava, entering the heart from a dorsocranial direction

•

Caudal vena cava – the largest vein in the body, returning blood from all caudal structures in the body (except for the
digestive tract) and traversing the abdomen and thorax in a dorsal position. It enters the heart from a dorsocaudal
direction.

•

The portal vein - blood from the digestive tract needs to be processed before entering the general circulation to
remove excess nutrients and toxins. The portal vein collects all the digestive tract blood and carries it directly to the
liver. ‘Portal’ comes from the Latin for gateway, so you may think of the portal vein as the gateway of nutrients
acquired from digestion into the body.

Nervous system
The nervous system can be divided by location into the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system
(PNS). The CNS is the brain and the spinal cord, located within the skull and vertebrae of the axial skeleton respectively, and
runs the long central axis of the body. The PNS runs out from the CNS throughout the entire body. To do this, the PNS contains
many long peripheral nerves. There are also groups of nerve cell bodies found within the PNS, which are called ganglia.
The special senses of taste, smell, sight, and hearing are also important parts of the nervous system.

Lymphatic system (lymphoreticular)
Like capillaries, there are lymphatic ducts draining fluid from every tissue in the body. The largest organ in the lymphatic
system is the spleen, usually located in the cranioventral abdomen just caudal to the stomach. Lymph nodes are the other
major lymphatic structure. These are localisations of immune cells that monitor what has entered the body through the
various body openings or through the skin. Thus there are many lymph nodes in the caudoventral head and at the base of the
lungs. The digestive tract also has numerous lymph nodes throughout its length and lymph nodes in the caudoventral body
wall monitor the caudal body organs and body openings.

Localised body systems
There are 5 localised or regional specific body systems, found in only some regions of the body.

Respiratory System
The respiratory system is only found in the cranial half of the body – in the head, neck, and thorax. The system begins in the
nasal passages, passing internally through the maxilla of the skull. The pharynx and larynx connect the nasal passages to the
trachea, the long tube lined with cartilage rings that passes through the neck ventral to the vertebral column, close to the
ventral midline. In the thorax, the lungs surround the heart on the cranial, dorsal, and lateral sides. The diaphragm, the
muscle which divides the thoracic cavity from the abdominal cavity, is fundamental to breathing.

Digestive system
The digestive system is present in many body regions, however, the bulk of the organs are located in the abdominal cavity.
The tongue and teeth are located within the mouth in the head. The oesophagus traverses the neck, once again ventral to the
vertebral column, close to the ventral midline, in close association with the trachea. The oesophagus continues through the
dorsal thorax, before entering the stomach in the cranial abdomen. The liver is located cranial to the stomach, immediately
caudal to the diaphragm. The liver processes the blood from the digestive tract, as well as performing many critical metabolic
functions. The intestines fill most of the abdominal cavity and the digestive system subject will provide additional details
about where each part of the intestines can be located. The final, caudal part of the digestive system travels through the pelvic
cavity.

Reproductive system
In anatomy studies, we divide the reproductive organs into two systems historically termed male and female based on the
which organs were most often present. It is a simplification to aid general understanding of the systems and their functions
but it does not adequately represent all individuals.

Both the anatomically female and male reproductive system is predominantly located in the dorsal abdomen and the pelvic
canal, with smaller portions located on the body surface. The female has mammary glands located on both the thoracic and
abdominal ventral surface, while the penis in the male extends on the caudal and the caudoventral body wall.

Excretory system
The excretory system, which removes waste from the circulating blood, is far more restricted in location being only found in
the abdominal and pelvic cavities. The kidneys are located dorsocranially in the abdomen, just ventral to the lumbar
vertebrae. The bladder, the urine storage organ, is in the ventrocaudally abdomen. In anatomically female animal, a broad
tube runs from the bladder through the pelvic cavity to take urine from the body. In the anatomically male animal, this tube is
much longer and runs through the penis in the position described above.

Endocrine system
The endocrine system contains 5 distinct organs that produce hormones which subsequently circulate through the body. 4 of
the endocrine organs are located in the skull or cranial neck (pineal, pituitary, thyroid, parathyroid), while the adrenal gland is
located in the dorsocranial abdomen, in close association with the kidneys.

Cells to Systems: Lecture 7
TRANSPORT OF MOLECULES AROUND THE BODY
Dr Laura Dooley
laura.dooley@unimelb.edu.au

Learning Objectives:
•

Describe the major body fluid compartments and the composition of intracellular and
extracellular body fluid

•

Explain how water and solutes traverse the capillary wall, using Fick’s equation and
Starling’s hypothesis

•

Describe the organization of the cardiovascular and lymphatic systems and their role
in fluid homeostasis

•

Explain the mechanisms underlying disruptions to fluid homeostasis including
oedema and lymphoedema

Volume and composition of the fluid compartments of the body
• Body fluids are 60-70% of body weight
• Body fluids are in two main compartments.
o The intracellular compartment contains 2/3 of total body water
o The extracellular compartment contains 1/3 of total body water
■ Lies outside cell membranes and consists of plasma, lymph,
interstitial fluid and fluid in transcellular compartment (eg. CSF)
■ ¼ of extracellular fluid is intravascular
■ ¾ of extravascular fluid is interstitial
• The composition of extracellular and intracellular compartments is very different.
o Extracellular fluid contains high concentrations of Na+, Cl-, Ca2+, HCO3■ Extracellular fluid solute concentration can fluctuate
o Intracellular fluid contains high concentrations of K+, Mg2+,
phosphates, phospholipids and proteins.
■ Intracellular fluid solute content is normally fixed and maintained
by active transport mechanisms (covered in Lecture 9)
o For an animal to survive and function correctly the volume and
composition of the intracellular and extracellular compartments must be
rigorously maintained.
o Tonicity (measure of osmotic pressure) can be isotonic,
hypertonic or hypotonic.
Transport of fluid and solutes
• Two body systems transport fluid and solutes around the body; the
cardiovascular and the lymphatic systems.
• Both have thin walled vessels that allow molecules to diffuse over short
distances between the vessel and the interstitial fluid
1

Cardiovascular system
• Transports blood and is composed of:
o Heart
o Arterial system
o Capillaries/exchange network
o Venous system
• Blood transports:
o Nutrients and waste products
o Gases
o Water, electrolytes and hormones
o Cells of the immune system
• Capillaries allow the exchange of nutrients and metabolic products by diffusion
across the endothelial wall of the capillary
• Capillaries consist of a single layer of endothelial cells surrounded by a
basement membrane made up of a fine network of reticular collagen fibres.
• Venules have a discontinuous layer of vascular smooth muscle cells. They
carry blood back into low-pressure veins that return blood to the heart
There are several types of capillaries:
• Continuous capillaries
o Found in muscle, skin, lung, fat and connective tissues.
o Contain 10-15nm wide junctions or clefts between endothelial cells
o Hydrophilic molecules must pass through the clefts or small, coated
pits in the endothelial cell membrane called caveolae.
• Fenestrated capillaries – more ‘leaky’
o Found in kidneys, intestines, endocrine glands, and joints.
o Endothelial cells contain pores called fenestrae that enhance the
permeability to small hydrophilic molecules.
• Discontinuous capillaries – very ‘leaky’
o Found in bone marrow, liver, and spleen.
o They have wide clefts (100-1000nm) between adjacent endothelial cells
that are permeable to large molecules
o They also have large pores or fenestrations, which increases movement
of large molecules.
• Neural capillaries
o Found in brain
o Special case of continuous capillaries with tight junctions and no caveolae.
o Endothelial cells have tight junctions and capillary is surrounded by a
basement membrane and enclosed by the endfeet of astrocytes (glial
cells)
o Water diffuses, but solutes require transport mechanisms
Movement across the capillary wall
• Water crosses by osmosis
o Capillary walls are highly permeable to water
• Lipid soluble molecules like gases are able to cross endothelial cells by diffusion
• Other molecules and ions pass through water filled clefts and pores between
adjacent endothelial cells (1% of total area of capillary endothelium)
• Capillary endothelial cells can exchange small amounts of protein by endocytosis
and exocytosis, but albumin and other plasma proteins cannot cross continuous
2

•
•

capillary walls
Some capillaries are leaky (wide clefts and fenestrae, eg. liver) and some are
tight (eg. brain)
Leaky capillaries allow more macromolecules and proteins to escape

Forces that govern fluid exchanges between blood and interstitial fluid across
capillaries
• Passive diffusion (Fick’s law)
Fick’s equation describes factors that influence the rate of net diffusion across a membrane:
1. Magnitude of concentration gradient
 Greater the difference in concentration, faster the rate of net diffusion
2. Permeability of the membrane to the substance
 Greater the permeability, faster the rate of net diffusion
3. Surface area of membrane available for diffusion
 Larger the surface area, faster the rate of net diffusion
4. Molecular weight of substance
 Heavier the molecule, the slower the rate of net diffusion
5. Distance of diffusion
 Greater the distance, the slower the rate of net diffusion
•

Bulk flow across capillaries: Starling’s forces
• The four Starling’s forces that regulate fluid movement filtration across
the wall of a capillary are:
o Hydrostatic pressure in the capillary (Pc).
■ Capillary hydrostatic pressure is the pressure exerted on the inside
of the capillary walls by the blood (35 mm Hg at the arterial end of
the capillary and 15 mm Hg at the venous end)
o Hydrostatic pressure in the interstitial fluid (Pif), which works in the
reverse direction
o Oncotic pressure in the capillary (c)
■ Osmotic force exerted by plasma proteins which is equal to about
25 mmHg and drives fluid back into the capillary
o Oncotic pressure in the interstitial fluid (if)
■ This is very low and has minimal effect

The net fluid flux:
• Depends upon the surface area and permeability of the capillaries
• The balance of these forces allows the calculation of the net driving pressure
and dictates the direction and magnitude of flow
• At the arterial end of the capillary there is a net movement of fluid out of the
capillary and at the venous end fluid is reabsorbed
• Overall there is a small net filtration of fluid out of the capillary (and some protein
loss)
o Only about 90% of fluid is returned at the venous end and the remaining
10% of fluid and any proteins are returned to the blood by the lymphatic
system
Lymphatic system
Lymphatic pathways form a distinct circulation of fluid and cells, which is separate
from, but closely integrated with, the cardiovascular system, although the two
circulations differ considerably in the composition of their fluids, their cellular content
and their hydrodynamics.

3

The lymphatic system:
Returns fluid, protein and cells from interstitial spaces to the cardiovascular system
Network of vessels lined by endothelial cells
o Initial lymphatics start in the interstitial spaces
■ The spaces where fluids, nutrients and metabolites are
exchanged between parenchymal cells and blood
o Collecting lymphatic ducts take fluid to regional lymph nodes
(afferent lymphatics)
o Efferent lymphatics take lymph from one or more lymph nodes to the
thoracic duct or the right lymphatic duct, which then join the great
veins in the neck
Functions:
1. Return of excess filtered fluid to the bloodstream
2. Defence against disease: lymph passes through lymph nodes located
within the lymphatic system
3. Transport of absorbed fat: fat absorbed in the GI system is unable to
access capillaries but can enter initial lymphatics
4. Return of filtered proteins: when plasma proteins do leak from capillaries,
they travel within the lymphatics back to the intravascular space
•
•

Oedema
• Oedema is defined as the accumulation of excess body fluid, which can be
intracellular or extracellular
• Intracellular oedema: due to physical damage to cell membrane or failure of cell
metabolism leading to excessive Na+ and water entry
• Extracellular oedema: accumulation in interstitial tissues or in body cavities
• Five major mechanisms of extracellular odema:
1. Increased plasma hydrostatic pressure
2. Decreased plasma colloid oncotic pressure
3. Lymphatic obstruction (= lymphoedema)
4. Increased vascular permeability
5. Sodium retention
• Lymphoedema is the build-up of excess fluid due to the obstruction of lymph drainage
o Can be due to blocked or damaged lymphatics

Cells to Systems Lecture 9
MOVEMENT OF MOLECULES ACROSS CELL MEMBRANES
Dr. Laura Dooley
Intended learning outcomes:

•
•
•

Describe the composition of the cell membrane and explain how the distribution of
phospholipids and proteins influences the membrane permeability to ions,
hydrophilic and hydrophobic compounds, and cell-cell communication
Describe how cells regulate the movement of substances across their membranes
and the role of diffusion, facilitated diffusion, and primary and secondary active
transport mechanisms
Explain how energy from the Na+ and K+ electrochemical gradients across the
plasma membrane are maintained

Cell membranes
Biological membranes are composed mainly of lipids and proteins. They are
selective permeable barriers and carry out a number of important cellular functions.
All animal cells are surrounded by a plasma membrane and they also contain a
number of internal membranes that surround organelles.
Properties of cell membranes
• Separate the intracellular and extracellular fluid, allowing these to differ
in composition
• Provide a selective barrier that is permeable to water and some
molecules, but impermeable to others
• Cell membranes control the flow of information between cells and their
environment:
o Contain specific molecular pumps, channels and transport mechanisms
for small and large molecules
o Permit selective exchanges to take place ( e.g. ions &
metabolites), thus maintaining the unique intracellular composition
o Proteins, nucleic acids, nucleotides & sugars that the cell
synthesises or accumulates at great metabolic cost are controlled
o Contain specific receptors for external stimuli, and some membranes
generate signals which can be chemical or electrical
• Internal organelle membranes allow functional compartments to exist within a cell
o Nucleus, mitochondria, lysosomes, endoplasmic reticulum and golgi
apparatus are all contained within membranes
o Enzymes or ions within organelles can be kept separate from the cell
cytoplasm
Common features of cell membranes (fluid-mosaic model)
Consist of a phospholipid bilayer containing different types and amounts of lipids,
with cholesterol and protein molecules embedded. The combinations of these
components give each cell membrane its distinctive identity and specialized
functions.
•

Membrane lipids are relatively small molecules that are amphipathic in that
they have:
o A hydrophilic (water loving) polar ‘head group’ eg glycerol,
1

•

•

•

phosphate and alcohol
o A hydrophobic (water hating) non-polar region made up of two fatty
acid chains.
 hydrophobic interior provides the barrier function, making
the membrane essentially impermeable to polar molecules
such as amino acids, sugars, proteins and nucleic acids
The fluidity of the membrane bilayer, which has acts like a two-dimensional
liquid, allows movement of individual molecules
o Phospholipids (and proteins) can diffuse sideways freely within their own
monolayer so that neighbouring phospholipid molecules can change
places with each other
o Movement of lipids and proteins within the membrane is functionally
important as it can permit molecules to associate for expression of their
activity as well as aiding or inhibiting diffusion of particular substances
Membrane proteins are scattered throughout the bilayer and perform many
functions. Protein functions include:
o Transport of molecules (focus of this lecture)
o Enzymatic activity
o Signal transduction
o Cell to cell recognition
o Intercellular joining
o Attachment to extracellular matrix
Proteins are crucial both for membrane stability and function
o Integral proteins
■ Have transmembrane helices that span the entire lipid bilayer
once or several times
o Peripheral proteins
■ Only bound to one side of the lipid bilayer
■ Can be attached to an integral membrane protein

Transport of molecules across cell membranes
The permeability of biological membranes is highly selective. The flow of molecules
and ions between a cell and its environment is precisely regulated by specific transport
systems. Such systems:
• Regulate cell volume and maintain intracellular pH and ionic composition
within a narrow range to provide a favourable environment for enzyme activity.
• They extract and concentrate metabolic fuels and building blocks from
their environment and extrude toxic substances.
• Generate ionic gradients essential for excitability of nerves and muscles.
Three basic processes of movement across cell membranes
• Simple diffusion down an electrochemical gradient
 Due to the kinetic motion of the molecule
• Facilitated diffusion
 Requires interaction with a carrier protein
• Active transport
 Carrier mediated and energy dependent
Simple Diffusion
Diffusion is the random molecular movement of substances, molecule by molecule,
either through intermolecular spaces in the membrane or using a carrier protein. The
2

driving force for diffusion is the concentration or electrical gradient
• Net rate of diffusion is proportional to the concentration difference (or
partial pressure difference for a gas).
Movement of ions is affected by their electrical charge. Anions move to positively
charged areas and cations to negatively charged areas, leading to a difference in
charge between two adjacent areas. This produces an electrical gradient. Movement
of ions is regulated by the electrochemical gradient (both a concentration gradient
and an electrical gradient contribute).
Larger charged molecules can across a cell membrane through pores or channels
lined by proteins provided that:
• There is an electrochemical gradient favouring diffusion and
• Integral membrane proteins are present to help get the molecule across the
membrane
• Protein channels involved in simple diffusion are of two classes:
• Membrane pores or ungated channels, e.g. aquaporin
• Gated channels, e.g. ion, ligand or mechanically gated channels
Gates can be controlled in several ways:
Voltage gating, where conformational state depends upon the difference
between ionic charges on two sides of the membrane. Transmembrane ion
channels selective for K+, Na+, Cl-, and Ca2+ are present in virtually every
living cell and have a gate that can be open or closed.
o Chemical or ligand gating, where binding of the ligand alters the
conformational state and opens (or closes) the gate e.g. for the
neurotransmitter (acetylcholine)
o Mechanical gating, where a stimulus such as stretch alters the conformation
state
o

Facilitated Diffusion
Facilitated diffusion involves a conformational change of the channel protein following
binding of the transport molecule to a receptor. The receptor can become saturated
and the rate of diffusion is dependent on the binding and release of the transported
molecule, rather than the concentration or electrical gradient. Facilitated diffusion does
not require energy.
• The molecule moves down its concentration gradient
• Transport proteins show substrate specificity, but competition can occur
between structurally similar substrates
• Receptor can become saturated if the solute concentration is high
Active Transport
Passage of some molecules does not rely upon diffusion. They are transported
against an electrochemical gradient (uphill). They are dependent on carrier proteins
and require energy, either directly (primary active transport) or indirectly (secondary
active transport).
•

Primary active transport (ATP dependent)
• e.g. Na+K+ATPase, pumps are integral membrane glycoproteins
found in all animal cells and pump 3Na+ out for each 2 K+ into a cell.
• This pump uses about 1/3 of an animal’s entire energy output.
i.
ATPase cleaves 1 molecule of ATP (ATP ➔ADP), which
changes the conformation of the protein and flips the ion binding

•

site to the opposite side of the membrane. Dephosphorylation
restores the pump to its original state.
The pump is also an electrogenic pump as it generates a voltage
across the membrane (membrane potential) by releasing an excess
of positive ions outside and leaves the inside negative
Membrane potentials are necessary for nerve cell excitability and
represent a stored form of energy for secondary active transport

Secondary active transport (co-transport)
• Relies on a concentration gradient set up by primary active transport
and couples the transport of two compounds across a membrane.
• It effectively uses transmembrane solute gradients as a source of
energy.
• Occurs when uphill transport of one molecule e.g. glucose from the
gut, is coupled with the simple downhill transport of an ion e.g. Na+.

The electrochemical gradient into the cell for Na+ (created by the
Na+/K+ pump in the basolateral membrane) provides the driving force
needed for active uptake of glucose into the cell.
• Classified as
i.
Symporters (two solutes move in the same direction) e.g. Na+
and amino acids
ii.
Antiporters (two solutes move in the opposite direction or
counter- transport) e.g. the exchange of Na+ (in) and H+ (out)
Large molecule transport
Some molecules are too large to be transported by channels and instead bind to
specific protein receptor molecules in the cell membrane to form intracytoplasmic
vesicles. The vesicles are then incorporated into the plasma membrane by
invagination (endocytosis) or pinched off from the plasma membrane (exocytosis)
• Endocytosis: The extracellular face of the cell membrane fuses to form
vesicles around the macromolecule and the vesicle is pulled into the cell.
There are three types of endocytosis:
■ Pinocytosis is the continuous unspecific uptake of extracellular
fluid and molecules dissolved in it
■ Receptor mediated endocytosis via clathrin–coated pits or
caveolin- coated pits. Pits contain integral protein receptors for
molecules being endocytosed e.g. low-density lipoproteins.
■ Phagocytosis involves the endocytosis of particulate matter
such as microorganisms or cell debris by phagocytes.
•

•

Exocytosis: selective export of macromolecules out of the cell, e.g.
hormones for secretion kept in secretory vesicles can fuse with the cell
membrane and be released.

Role of blood and blood cells in homeostasis
Astrid Oscos Snowball

Learning Objectives:
1. Describe the components of blood (cells, ions, proteins, platelets), giving their
normal values, and explain how blood is essential for maintaining homeostasis

2. Describe the leukocytes found in the blood of normal animals and the differences in
appearance between common domestic species

3. Describe the normal balance of leukocyte turnover and how this can alter in
response to infection

Blood
Plasma 55% by volume
o Water about 90%
o Protein about 7%
▪

Albumin, globulin, immunoglobulins

▪

Hormones and other chemical messengers

▪

Fibrin for clot formation

o Electrolytes 2-3%

o Platelets
▪

200-1000 x 106/ml

Delivers nutrients and oxygen to tissues and removes metabolic wastes.
Vital for maintaining body temperature and pH and delivering chemical
messengers to tissues and organs.

Red blood cell (RBC) shape

A normal mammalian RBC is about 7-8µm in diameter and about 2.5µm thick
Most mammalian RBCs are a biconcave disc
o Maximises the cell’s surface area to volume ratio to facilitate the gas transfer
In some ungulates (sheep, cattle, deer), there is less of a central depression
Llamas and camels have oval-shaped RBCs.
Mature mammalian RBCs lose their nucleus, while those of birds, reptiles,
amphibians, and fish do not.

Red blood cell function

The primary function of RBC is to transport O2 from the lungs to the tissues
and CO2 from the tissues to the lungs
Also involved in pH balance
The functional molecule in RBC is haemoglobin (Hb).
o Each Hb molecule has four haem units, each with an iron atom that
can bind 1 O2 molecule; hence four molecules of O2 can be carried/Hb
molecule
o The binding is loose and reversible, allowing O2 to dissociate in the low O2
tension found in tissues.
o RBCs are vital for CO2 transport back to the lungs, either combined with Hb
(21%) as bicarbonate ions within the cell (64%) or dissolved in the cytoplasm
(4%). The remainder is carried as CO2 or bicarbonate ions in the blood
plasma.
o Hb also binds H+ ions, which has a buffering effect.

Platelets

Small cytoplasmic pieces (2µm) budded off from megakaryocytes in the bone marrow
Involved in haemostasis or clotting of blood
Damage to blood vessels activates platelets, and these are deposited at the injury site
Activated platelets bind serum thrombin, which in turn converts soluble plasma
fibrinogen into insoluble fibrin, forming a mesh of fibres over the platelet plug

Identification of leucocytes in domestic species

Five main types of leukocytes or white blood cells (WBC) can be identified in common
domestic species using haematoxylin and eosin, or Wright’s stain:
•

Lymphocytes are round cells with a nucleus that takes up most of the cell and often
has a slight indentation. The cytoplasm stains pale blue. These are the next most
common blood leukocyte type in domestic species and the most common type in
ruminant blood. Immunostaining is required to identify the B and T lymphocyte
subsets and the NK cells.

•

Monocytes are larger cells with a nucleus ranging from oval to varying degrees of
indentation, from single kidney bean shape to multiple indentations and lobular
shapes. Monocytes usually are less than 10% of the blood leukocytes. The
cytoplasm is blue- grey and can contain vacuoles, especially after activation.

•

Neutrophils generally have a segmented or multi-lobed nucleus and neutral staining
cytoplasm. Mature neutrophils have multiple lobes or segments, while immature
neutrophils (band neutrophils) have simpler, less-segmented nuclei. These are the
most common leukocytes in the blood of most domestic species other than
ruminants.

•

Eosinophils have a segmented or multi-lobed nucleus that is less defined than a
neutrophil nucleus. The cytoplasm stains pale blue but is generally obscured by
granules that stain reddish to orange (eosin-loving). The shape and colour of the
granules differ between species. Eosinophils are rare in the normal blood of most
species.
o

Dog granules are round and variable in number

o

Cat granules are rod-shaped and fill the cytoplasm

o

Horse granules are large, round, or oblong and fill the cytoplasm, often hiding
the nucleus

o
•

Ruminant granules are small, and round and fill the cytoplasm

Basophils – similar in size to neutrophils but very rare in the blood of most
species. They have a segmented nucleus and a light purple cytoplasm (basic
staining). The granules may or may not be visible, depending on the stain used
and the species.
o

Dog granules may have low numbers of small purple granules or be invisible.

o

Cat granules are small, round, and lavender coloured

o

Horse granules are small, numerous, and purple. They may hide the nucleus

o

Ruminant basophil granules are small, numerous, and purple

White blood cell functions

Lymphocytes are involved in the adaptive immune system. B lymphocytes or B cells produce
antibodies to antigens (molecules recognised as foreign), referred to as humoral or antibodymediated immunity. T lymphocytes or T cells have several functions. T helper cells are
involved in activating B cells and other T cells. Cytotoxic T cells induce apoptosis or
programmed cell death in other cells that express foreign antigens on their surface (such as
virus-infected cells). This is referred to as cell-mediated immunity.
Monocytes are phagocytic and antigen-presenting cells – they process antigen and present
it to T and B lymphocytes. They are the immature form of tissue macrophages.
Neutrophils are often associated with bacterial infections. They are phagocytic and are the
first line of defence against pathogens.
Eosinophils are often associated with helminth parasite infections such as intestinal
roundworm and tapeworm infections and may also be involved in allergic responses.
Basophils are most often associated with allergic responses. They bind IgE, an
immunoglobulin associated with allergic responses, and release histamine in response to
allergens that the IgE recognises.
Most WBC exerts their functions in tissues rather than blood, so they need to migrate out of
the blood and into tissue sites of infection. They do this by emigrating from the blood into
sites of inflammation, following cytokine and chemokine gradients produced by the infected
tissues. WBC express adhesion molecules on their surface, which bind to complementary
adhesion receptors on blood vessel endothelial cells, slowing them down in the blood flow
and allowing the WBC to migrate between the endothelial cells into sites of inflammation.

Haemopoiesis (Haematopoiesis)

The cellular elements are all produced from haematopoietic stem cells (HSC) in
the bone marrow
The production and regulation of mature blood cells (haemopoiesis) is vital to
the homeostasis of animals, and the role of the haemopoietic system is to
maintain adequate numbers of RBC, platelets, and WBC
Blood cells display certain distinctive features.
o The short lifespan of most mature blood cells requires continuous new blood

cell formation throughout life
▪

Total new blood cell production (RBC and WBC) is around 3 x 1011/day.

o This rate of production must be maintained without pause for the lifespan of the
individual
▪

In humans, the bone marrow will have released > 1016 mature blood
cells during a 70-year lifespan

o The multiplicity of blood cell types: myeloid and lymphoid, need to be produced.
o The short lifespan of some Leukocytes limits their ability to damage the
animal’s tissues.

Bone marrow cells

Red blood cell morphology and function
Structure and composition:
• Most common blood cell, 4-10 m
• Contents - Water (60%) + haemoglobin (40%)

• Biconcave disk – maximises surface area
• Anucleate in mammals, nucleated in birds and reptiles and fish
• Stain eosinophilic (pink)
Ultrastructure:
• homogenous, electron dense
• no organelles in mature mammalian RBC (present in immature RBCs)
Haemoglobin functions - carry O2, CO2 & H+ (buffering role)
Life-span is about 80 d in cats; 100-120 d in dogs & humans; 150 d in horses, cattle &
sheep

Quick Quiz - What is this cell?

Platelets (thrombocytes) – Species Variation
• Small, round to ovoid bodies in mammals,
nucleated in birds (thrombocytes)
• Cytoplasmic pieces ‘budded off’ from
megakaryocyte
• ~ 2 m diameter, disc shaped

• Produced in bone marrow
• Lifespan 8-10 days (sequestered in the spleen)

Platelet function
• Blood clotting

Aggregation – platelet adherence
Coagulation – fibrin formation

• Aggregation – associated with endothelial cell injury;
formation of platelet plug
• Coagulation – initiated at larger sites of injury;
formation of a clot (thrombus)
• Clotting is tightly regulated

White Blood Cells - Leukocytes
Neutrophils

Monocytes

Leukocyte classification:

• 5 main types of WBC

Eosinophils

• Granulocytes
• Neutrophils
• Eosinophils

Lymphocyte
s

Basophils

• Basophils

• Monocytes
• Lymphocytes

Lymphocytes
• Most are small (~92%) size 7-8 m
• Less intermediate and large (~8%) size 9-20 m
• Round to indented nuclei, clumped chromatin,
small rim of blue cytoplasm, some have
granules
• Long life span – weeks to years
• Produced in thymus, bone marrow and lymphoid
tissue

Lymphocyte Functions
• Antibody production (humoral immune

response - B lymphocytes
• Regulate immune response - Helper T cells
(CD4+)

• Cytotoxicity (contain cytotoxic granules)
• T cells (CD8+)
• NK cells

Lymphocytes

Monocytes
• Size 15-25 m (largest leukocyte)

• Round/oval/bean-shaped/trilobed nuclei of
clumped chromatin
• Abundant blue cytoplasm, may contain
vacuoles
• Phagocytic
• Numbers are elevated during chronic
bacterial infections & protozoan infections

• Life-span is 20-40h in blood
• Macrophage precursors

Monocytes

Granulocytes - Neutrophils
•

Size 10-12 m

•

Multi-lobed nucleus (polymorphonuclear)

•

Clear cytoplasm with clear granules in most species

•

Pale pink granules in some species e.g. rabbits,
primates, avian, reptiles) - heterophils

•

Form first line of defence against microbial
infection

•

Life-span is 4-12h in blood & 1-2 days in tissues

•

Produced in bone marrow in adults

• Numbers are elevated during bacterial infections

Neutrophils

Granulocytes - Eosinophils
• Size 10-15 m
• Contain coarse red round cytoplasmic granules in
most species, rod shaped in cats. Some parrots
have pale blue granules
• Multi-lobed nucleus (polymorphonuclear)
• Life-span is 6-12h in blood & 2-3 days in tissues if
not stimulated
• Eosinophil function
• Major role in controlling parasitic infestation
• Possible roles against bacterial and viral
infections
• Role in allergic responses

Eosinophils

African Grey
Parrot

Granulocytes - Basophils
• Basophil size 10-12 m

• Segmented nucleus in mammals, round nucleus in birds and
reptiles
• Coarse round dark purple cytoplasmic granules contain
histamine, heparin, serotonin, hyaluronic acid, hydrolytic
enzymes, chemotactic factors. Lavender oval granules in cats
• Produced in bone marrow in adults
Functions:
• Major role in allergic and inflammatory actions
• Surface receptors for IgE
• Limited phagocytic and bactericidal activity
• Predominant source of IL-4 and IL-13 in allergic disease

Granulocytes - Basophils

Quick Quiz - What is this cell?

Tissue Leukocytes – Histiocytes
Macrophages:
• Highly phagocytic - ingest and kill microbes
• Clearance of damaged dying cells
• Antigen presenting cells (APC) – initiate
immune response
• Produce cytokines – signalling and
amplification of immune response
Dendritic cells:
• Arise from common dendritic cell
precursor. Two forms - classical DC and
plasmacytoid DC
• APC - activate T cells
• Present in tissues that are in contact with
the external environment (skin, intestines )

macrophage

monocyte

dendritic
cell

Tissue Leukocytes – Mast Cells
• Round cells with eccentric round nuclei
containing abundant purple granules
• Contain histamine, heparin, serotonin,
hyaluronic acid, hydrolytic enzymes,
chemotactic factors (similar to basophils)
• Attract eosinophils to tissue
• Not usually found in blood – can be seen in
blood with neoplasia (mast cell tumours) and in

low numbers in dogs with marked inflammation
e.g. pancreatitis.

Tissue Leukocytes – Plasma Cells
• Round cells with eccentric round

nuclei and abundant deep blue
cytoplasm with a prominent golgi
zone

• Differentiate from B lymphocytes
• Produce antibodies
• Not usually seen in blood (but
you can see similar looking
“activated” lymphocytes

What causes a change in blood numbers
Factors causing ↓ RBC in blood
• Decreased production e.g. bone marrow disease

↓

• Loss of RBC – haemorrhage or haemolysis
Factors causing ↓ WBC in blood
• Decreased production e.g., bone marrow disease
•

Redistribution e.g., into tissues with acute inflammation

Factors causing ↓ Platelets in blood
•

Decreased production e.g., bone marrow disease

•

Redistribution e.g., spleen

Factors causing ↓ Plasma components in blood

•

Reduced plasma volume - loss of water e.g., dehydration due vomiting, diarrhoea (causes ↑Hct ↑ TP)

•

Loss of proteins leading to ↓ TP

•

Loss of electrolytes ↓ Na, Cl, K e.g., diarrhoea

What causes a change in blood cell numbers

Where do leukocytes go when they die?
• 2-3 x 1011 new cells are produced
and die each day
• Nucleated cells undergo apoptosis
(programmed cell death)
• Removal - phagocytosis by
macrophages in spleen, liver,
bone marrow, tissue
