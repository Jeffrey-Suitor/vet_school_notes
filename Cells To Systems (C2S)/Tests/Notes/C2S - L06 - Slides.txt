Cells to Systems - Lecture 6, part 1
The Skeleton
Dr Janine Hofmann
Lecturer of Veterinary Anatomy

VETS30015 / VETS90121

Intended Learning Outcomes
At the end of this lecture, you should be able to:
•

Describe the position, relationships, form, and appearance of
the major bones of the quadruped skeleton, information used
to understand the skeleton scaffold within the body,
radiography, and as landmarks during clinical procedures.

•

Identify the major bones in novel animals, as not all animals
treated by veterinarians will be domestic species.

Axial skeleton

• Skull
• Mandible
• Hyoid
• Vertebral column
• Ribcage

Image by Dr Helen Davies

Skull and mandible
Skull
• Formed by an interlocking of many bones
• Fibrous joints between = “sutures”
• Sutures flexible as animal growing, allowing changes
in size and shape of skull
• Once adult size reached, sutures infiltrated with bone
to form a single structural unit
• Teeth reflect the animal’s diet

Mandible

• 2 bones, left and right
• Joined at intermandibular joint
• Fused with fibrocartilage suture, sometimes ossified
(bony).

• Incisive
• Nasal
• Maxillary

• Lacrimal
• Frontal

Unpaired:
• Occipital
• Sphenoid complex

Hyoid
• Suspends and supports the tongue, larynx, and pharynx
• 9 bones
• 4 paired
• 1 single
• Those connecting tongue and larynx = hyoid apparatus,
equivalent to hyoid in human
• Those connecting tongue to temporal bone =
suspensory apparatus
• Joints between bones most commonly synovial
• does vary between species and even within a species

Thoracic skeleton
1st sternebra = manubrium

The ‘ribcage’
• thoracic vertebrae
• ribs
• sternum

Manubrium
8th sternebra = xiphoid process,
elongated by xiphoid cartilage

Adapted from: Miller’s Anatomy of the Dog (4th edition)

Take home messages
• The skeleton is divided into axial and appendicular parts
• The axial skeleton contains the skull, the mandible, the hyoid, the vertebral column (including tail), and
the ribcage
• The skull contains many bones fused together
• Know the bone names and where the bones are positioned relative to each other

• The mandible articulated with the skull and is in two bilaterally symmetrical halves
• The hyoid also contains several bones
• The vertebral column is divided into 5 regions

Can you visualise where the skeleton is?
Image by Helen Davies

Take home messages
• The skeleton is divided into axial and appendicular parts
• The appendicular skeleton contain the forelimbs and hindlimbs
• Know the major forelimb bones and their relative positions
• Know the major hindlimb bones and their relative positions
• By knowing the skeleton of the dog, bones can be identified through their relative positions in other
species
• Know the names commonly applied to the bumps, grooves, and holes of bones.
