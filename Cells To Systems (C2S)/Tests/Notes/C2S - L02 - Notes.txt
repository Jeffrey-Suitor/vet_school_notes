CELLS TO SYSTEMS – CONNECTIVE TISSUES
INTRODUCTION
Histology: Microscopic anatomy, i.e. the study of the structure of tissues
• light microscope
• electron microscope
Importance:
•
•

Helps to understand normal function
Provides basis for understanding of pathology

Methods for examination of tissues:
•
•
•
•
•

fixation (e.g. formalin)
embedding (e.g. paraffin wax)
sectioning (~ 5 µm thick)
staining, e.g. haematoxylin and eosin (H&E)
mounting
Relationship of threedimensional structure to
appearance of section

Problems:
•
•

Two-dimensional representation of three-dimensional structure
Artefacts - postmortem change, variation in staining, folding of sections, air
bubbles, shrinkage, etc

Terminology:
Staining characteristics: eosinophilic (pink), basophilic (haematoxylin: blue – taken
up by nucleic acids, e.g. DNA in nucleus and RNA in ribosomes in cells actively
synthesizing proteins)
Cells: - blast (not fully differentiated), -cyte (fully differentiated, mature)
Types of tissue:
All organs are comprised of combinations of four basic tissue types:
1. Connective tissue
2. Epithelial tissue
3. Muscular tissue
4. Nervous tissue

CONNECTIVE TISSUE
COMPOSITION:
Composed of cells and extracellular
(intercellular) material.

•

extracellular material:
- amorphous (shapeless; = ‘ground
substance’)
- fluid (blood, lymph)
- jelly-like (vitreous humour)
- solid (cartilage, bone)

Amorphous
extracellular
material

- fibrous
- ‘collagen’, ‘reticular’, ‘elastic’
Cells

Collagen fibres
Collagen fibres:
- strong, flexible
- white fibrous tissue
- eosinophilic in H&E
- mostly type I collagen,
but variations in
specialized tissues

Reticular fibres:
- fine network
- poorly stained in H&E,
black in reticulin stain
- composed of varying
combinations of
collagens and
extracellular matrix
glycoproteins

Reticular fibres

Elastic fibres:
- stretchable, elastic
- yellow fibrous tissue
- eosinophilic in H&E;
black in Verhoeff’s stain
Elastic fibres
(Verhoeff’s stain)

CONNECTIVE TISSUE PROPER
Functions:
• support
• protection
• connections within locomotor system
• holds tissues together
• energy storage
Types:
• loose (higher ratio of cells to fibres)
• adipose (many fat cells)
• dense (lower ratio of cells to fibres)
- regularly arranged
- irregularly arranged

Mesenchymal cells

Cells:
• mesenchymal cell
- in embryonic tissues
- stellate (star-shaped) - many cytoplasmic processes
- oval/round nucleus
•

fibroblast
- stellate or spindle-shaped
- ovoid nucleus
- abundant basophilic cytoplasm
- synthesizes and secretes collagen and
other extracellular matrix components
- differentiates into fibrocyte

Fibroblasts

•

fibrocyte
- small flattened elongated cell
- elongated nucleus
- very little cytoplasm
- less active in secretion than fibroblast

Fibrocytes

•

macrophage
- large cell
- derived from blood monocyte
- phagocytic cell (engulfs particulate matter
including microorganisms and dead tissue)
- produces lysosomal proteases (proteindegrading enzymes), cytokines, prostaglandins
(substances that mediate inflammatory
reactions
Macrophages

•

fat cell (adipocyte)
- accumulate fat droplets in cytoplasm
- fat droplets coalesce to form single large fat
droplet, displacing nucleus to side of cell
- energy storage, insulation and protection

Adipocytes

•

mast cell
- scattered, in low numbers in most connective
tissues (often close to blood vessels)
- cytoplasm filled with granules containing
heparin (anticoagulant), histamine (increases
blood vessel permeability), serotonin
(vasoconstrictor) and proteases
- degranulate when tissue damaged

Mast cells

•

plasma cell
- B lymphocyte actively producing antibody
- eccentrically placed round nucleus with
chromatin radially arranged
- abundant basophilic cytoplasm
- negative image (Golgi apparatus) prominent

•

melanocyte
- pigment cell
Plasma cells

•

occasional other cells, e.g. leucocytes
