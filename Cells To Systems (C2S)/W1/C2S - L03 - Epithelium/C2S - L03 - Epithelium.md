# C2S - L3 - Epithelium
## Intended Learning Outcomes
- Explain the system for classifying epithelial tissues 
- Provide examples of different types of epithelial tissues
- Identify different types of epithelia

## Epithelial Tissue Overview

What are the two types of epithelial tissue and describe each
?
Surface epithelia: sheets of cells that cover external surfaces and line the internal surfaces of the body
Glandular epithelium: secretory cells of glands

Describe how epithelium is classified
?
Number of layers: simple = 1, squamous > 1
Shape of the cells: squamous (flat), cuboidal, columnar (rectangular)

What are some important aspects to consider when identifying epithelial cells
?
Shape, location, and spacing of the nuclei
Plane of the section determines the number of cell layers
A single surface is **NOT** lined by several types of epithelium
The number of epithelial cell layers will be the smallest number of layers visible

Describe simple squamous epithelium and where is it found
?
Single layer of flattened, plate, like cells
Nuclei are flattened or ovoid and are found in the centre of the cell
Body cavities, heart, blood vessels, and lymph vessels are all lined by simple squamous epithelium

Describe simple cuboidal epithelium and where they are fouund
?
Single layer of cuboidal cells
Found in small excretory ducts, thyroid follicle, tubules of kidney are lined by simple cuboidal epithelium

Describe simple columnar epithelium and where are they fouund
?
Taller than they are wide
The nuclei are located at the same height within the cells
Internal surface of small and large intestine, gall bladder are lined by simple columnar epithelium
Small inestine is lined by simple columnar epithelium

What are goblet cells::unicellular gland cells secreting mucin which lubricates the surface fo the epithelium

What are the two surfaces of cells
?
Apical free surface: Faces the lumen, and has a brush border to increase the surface area of absorption
Basal surface: Basement membrane separates from the underlying connective tissue

Describe stratified squamous epithelium
?
At the surface of the epithelium, cells appear like flat scales similar to simple squamous epithelium
The sahep of the cells that form from the surface of the epithelium give the name of the epithelium
The deepest cells are cuboidal or columnar in shape (basal layer)

Describe keratinized epithelium
?
Specialized epihelium containing a tough ressitant protein called keratin
Apical cells are dead, lost nucleus and cytoplasm
Specialization makes the epithelium and are fouund in mammalian skin

What determines the shape of the cells in the surface layer of transitional epithelium::degree of distension (relaxed & distended)

What are the differences between the relaxed and distended transitional epithelium states
?
Relaxed: Basal cells are cuboidal or columnar, Several layers of polyhedral cells, superficial cells have convex, dome shaped luminal surface
Distended: One or two layers of cuboidal cells, superficial layer of large, low cuboidal squamous cell, resemble stratified squamous epithelium

Where can transitional epithelium be found::Urinary bladder (relaxed when empty, distended when full)

Describe pseudostratified columnar epithelium
?
All cells are in contact with the basement membrane
Not all of them reach surface of the epithelium
Nuclei are located in the widgest part of the cells
Nuclei are located at diffrent heights, giving stratified appearance
Fouund in the excretory ducts of many glands

Why are simple epithelial cells referred to as being polarized
?
Three distinct surfaces:
- Apical (or free) surface
- Lateral (or contact) surfaces which contact neighbouring epithelial cells
- Basal surface which rests on the basement membrane

Describe the basement membrane
?
Extracellular supporting layer of teh epithelium
Basement membrane is produced by the epithelial cells
It separates the epithelium from the underlying connective tissue
It acts as a selectively permeable filter between epithelium and connective tissue

Name 3 apical surface specializations of epithelium and describe each::
Cilia: Motile structures that beat ina  synchronous manner to move material across epithelial suraces
Microvilli/Sterocilia: Non-motile, finger or thread shaped extension of epithelial cells. Main function is to increase surface area for absorption. Microvilli are much shorter than stereocilia.

Name and describe 3 lateral and basal surface specializations
?
Occluding type: 
- **Tight junctions** (zonulae occludens), connect adjacent cells; close to apical surface
Adhering type:
- **Desmosomes** (maculae adherens) and zonulae adherens anchor cells to each other; connected to cytoskeleton
- **Hemidesmosomes** connect cells to basement membrane (half desmosomes)
Communicating type:
- **Gap junction** (nexus) allows movement of small molecules from one cell to an adjacent cell

## Glandular Epithelium

What are glandular epithelial cells specialized to do::Secretion

How do execrine glands work::release the secretory product(milk, mucus, sweat) via a system of ducts that open onto the surfaces of the body which are in contact with the external world (skin, respiratory tract, etc.)

How do endocrine glands work::release secretory product (typically horones) into the spaces between the secretory cells (extracellular space) from which it enters teh bloodstream

What are glands derived from::Developmentally derived from epithelia that grow into the underlying connective tissue

What structural function do exocrine glands serve::Exocrine glands maintain connection with the surface epithelium

T/F Endocrine glands maintain connection with surface epithelium::False, endocrine glands lose their surface connection

How do we classify glandular epithelium 
?
Morphology: Simple, vs compound (ducts), Tubular vs alveolar/acinar (secretory units)
Mode of secretion: Merocrine, Apocrine, Holocrine
Nature of secretion: Mucous, Serous, Mixed

What is the difference between simple vs compound ducts::Simple = 1, compound > 1

What is the difference between tubular and alveolar/acinar secretory units::Tubular is tube like, tubuloalveolar/tubuloacinar are a combination of both, acinar has no clear lumen while alveolar does have a circular lumen.

What are the 6 exocrine gland classifications based on morphology
?
1. Simple tubular
2. Simple coiled tubular
3. Simple branched tubular
4. Simple alveolar
5. Simple branched alveolar
6. Simple tubuloalveolar

What are the exocrine gralnd classification based on morphology::compound alveolar,  compound tubularalveolar, compound tubular

What are the 3 types of exocrine gland classification based on mode of secretion and give an example of each
?
Merocrine: Vesicles containing secretory products, release secretory product into the duct (Salivary glands)
Apocrine: When a vesicle containing product is released a part of the cell detaches as well (Mammmary glands)
Holocrine: When a vesicle containing a product is released the cell will die (Sebaceous glands)
