## Histology of Muscle

What are the functinos of the muscle
?
- Movemnt of bones
- Movement of material through hollow organs
- Manipulation of external objects
- Breathing
- Vocalization
- Eye movement

What are the 3 types of muscle tissue, their function, and complexity
- Smooth muscle (simplest)
  - Walls of most viscera, blood vessles, and skin
  - Not under concious control
  - Supplied by the autonomic nervous system
  - Not straited
- Skeletal Muscle
  - Usually attached to bones
  - Under concious control
  - Supplied by somatic nervous system
  - Striated
- Cardiac muscle
  - Wall of heart
  - Not under concious control
  - Supplied by the autonomic nervous system
  - Striated

Which muscle types are striated::Cardiac, skeletal

What are some other terms for each of the muscle types
?
Smooth muscle: Non-striated involuntary muscle
Skeletal muscle: Striated voluntary muscle
Cardiac muscle: Striated involuntary muscle

Describe smooth muscle cells, their shape, contents, and function
?
They are elongated cells containing actin, myosin, and intermdiate filaments (desmin). 
These cells are much smaller than skeletal muscle fibers. 
These actin and myosin filaments do not adhere to the same regular patterning you see in skeletal muscle. 
Dense bodies attach smooth muscle filaments to the cell membrane. 
During contraction the cells take on a squeezed sponge appearance.

Describe the orientation fo smooth muscle cells in the jejunum
?
Inner most layer with the cells oriented tranversely and an outer layer where the cells are oritentated longitudinally

Describe how the crossectioning of smooth muscle cells can affect their apperance
?
Longitudinally cut cells appear elongated while tranversely cut smooth muscle cells appear circular

What are the two categories of smooth muscle cells and what do they describe
?
Multiunit: functionally independent, often innervated by a single nerve terminal and never contract spontaneously (walls of blood vessels, eyes, hair follicles)
Visceral: bundles of cells connected by GAP junctions, contract spontaneously if stretched beyond a certain limit (walls of intestines or uterus)

Describe skeletal muscle fibers
?
Very long tubular cells
Peripherally placed nuclei, meaning tehy can contain several hundred small nuclei with 1 or two nucleoli located beneath plasma membraen
Skeletal muscle has characteristic crosstrations
Innvervated by somatic nervous system
Voluntary muscle

What types of fibers are represent in the skeletal muscle fibers of the tongue::longitudinal and tranverse fibers

What is a sarcomere and what is it comprised of
?
Sarcomere is a contractile unit, which when contract will pull the actin filametns overtop the myosin filaments and is comprised of:
- A band: myosin filaments which may overlap with actin filaments
- I band: actin filaments
- H zone: zone of myosin filaments only (no overlap with actin filaments) within the A band
- Z line: zone of apposition of actin filaments belonging to two neighbouring sarcomeres (mediated by a protein called alph-actinin)
- M line: band of connections between myosin filaments (mediated by proteins, e.g. myomesin, M-protein)

What regions of the sarcomere shorten during muscle contraction::H band and I band

T/F During contraction the A band of the sarcomere will shorten::False, the A band of the sarcomere remains unchanged

How do the regons of the sarcomere appear under electron microscopy
?
A band: dark
I band: light
Z line: dark

Describe the organization of skeletal muscle
?
Multinucleited muscle fibers form sarcomeres which form a sarcolemma
Muscle fibers are composed of multiple sarcolemma surounded in endomysium and then perimysium to form a muscle fascicles
Muscle fascicles are surrounded by eipmysium to form skeletal muscle

Define a motor unit and describe it's function
?
A motor unit is a group of muscle fibers innervated by a single neuron. The size of the motor unit varies depending upon function. The nerve fibre connects to the muscular fibre at the neuromuscular junction

What are the types of skeletal muscle fibers and how are they divided
?
Velocity of contraction
- Type 1 (slow) fibres
- Type 2 (fast) fibres
Energy Production
- Type 1 (slow oxydative) fibres
- Type 2A (fast-oxidative) fibers
- Type 2B/2x (fast-glycolytic) fibres

Define type 1 (slow-oxidative) fibers
?
Predominantly red muscle cells
Compartively thin
Contains a large amouunt of myoglobin and mitchondria
myosin with low ATPase activity
Contraction is slow and sustained (e.g. control of posture)
Relatively fatigue resistant

Define type 2A (fast-oxidative) fibers
?
Predominanly found in red muscle
Thicker fibres
Contains large amounts of myoglobin and many mitochondria
ATPase activity of the myosin isoform is high and contraction is fast

Define type 2B (fast-glycolytic) fibers
?
Predominanly fouund in white muscles
Thicker and contain little myoglobin
ATPase activity of the myosin isoform in white fibres is high, and contraction is fast
Type 2B/2X fibres contain only few mitochondria
Prone to fatigue

Describe the muscle spindle
?
Muscle spindlres are a sensory specialization of muscle tissue
A number of small specialized intrafusal muscle fibers (nuclear bag fibres and nuclear chain fibres) are surrouunded by a capsule of connective tissue
When the muscle is stretched the muscle fibers in the muscle spindle are stretched, sesnory nerves are stimulated, and a change in contraction of the muscle is perceived
Different types of intrafusal fibers and nerve endings allow the perception of position, velocity, and acceleration of the contraction of the muscle

Describe cardiac muscle
?
Cardiac muscle, the myocardium. consists of muscle cells, cardiomyocytes with one centrally placed nucleus. The nuclei are oval, pale, and located centrally in the cell.
Cardiac muscle cells exhibit cross-striations
Cardiac muscle cells excitation is mediated by rhythmically active modified cardiac muscle cells
Cardiac muscle is innervated by the autonomic nervous system, which adjusts the force generated by the muscle cells and the frequency of the heart beat
Cardiac muscle is for these reasons called involuntary striated muscle
Often branched at acute angles and are connected by intercalated discs
Intercalated discs occur at the ends of caridiac cells corresponding to the z line of the myofibrils

Where are the nuclei of cardiac muscle cells located and how many are there::centrally, 1 nuclei

What are the junctions found in intercalated discs
?
Fascia adherens: Anchor actin to nearest sarcomere
Macula adherens: Desomosome, stop separation during contraction
Gap junctions: Allow action potnetials to spread between cells

What feature allows you to distinguish between cardiac and skeletal muscle::The intercalated disc which will appear as a dark line

Describe Purkinje fibers
?
Conduct stimuli faster than regular cardiac muscle
extends from AV node, pierces firbous body, then divives into left and right bundles that travels beneath the endocardium toward the apex of the heart
The branches contract via specializations similar to intercalated disks
Thicker than ordinary cardiac muscle

How do purkinje fibers appear under microscopy compared to cardiac muscle::More pale

## Histology of Nervous Tissue

What composes the central nervous system::the brain and the spinal cord

What composes the periheral nervous system::Anything that isn't the brain and spinal cord

What are the two major classes of cells in the CNS
?
Neurones (nerve cells)
Neuroglia (glia cells)

Cytoplasm of many neurones contains aggresgates of rough endplasmic reticulum (Nissl bodies)
Prominent motor neurones in the ventral horn of the grey matter of the spinal cord
Size of perkaryon depends on level of activity and length of processes of the neuron

What is an astrocyte::Star shapped neuroglia cell. Procsses often in contact with blood vessels and provides mechanical and metabolic support. Scar forming cells fo the CNS

What is an ogliodendrocytes::They form a melin sheath arouund axons in the CNS and may surrouding several axons.

What is an ependymal cell::Line ventricles of braina dn central canal of spinal cord and are often ciliated and use simple cuboidal or low columnar cells

The PNS consists of what types of cells
?
Groups of neurones (ganglion cells) called ganglia
Fletowrk of nerve fibers called plexuses
Bundles of parallel nerve fibers that form the nerves and nerve root

What is the different between efferent and afferent nerves
?
efferent (motor fibres): originate from within neurones in CNS and pass out of the CNS into cranial and spinal nerves
afferent (sensory fibres): originate from nerve cells outside the CNS but enter the CNS via cranial or spinal nerves

What is the function fo a schwann cell::Schwann cells form a sheath arouund one axon and surrouund this axon with sevearl double layers of cell membrane. This insulates the axon improving it's ability to conduct.

What are ganglion::Aggregate of nerve cells outside the CNS. Indivdual gnaglion cells are surrounded by a layer of flattened satellite cells
