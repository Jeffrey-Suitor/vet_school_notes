Birds will response in ways they have been taught and raised
Hand reared birds can have a variety of responses which cannot be fully understood as easily
May not know as many of the cues or how to respond to other birds

Sudden behaviour often points to a disease process such as a bird that starts feather plucking as a pain response or disease response
Using clinical testing to determine

```
A - Antecedent settings or scene, what is the trigger
B - Behaviour, what it does
C - Consequence

Very long life stages
Hormones may also be involved because we don't desex
Hand reared
Altricial birds are neonatal and are until the eyes open, fully dependent on parent
Nestling is until the bird can start flying
Fledgling is when they can leave the nest and learn to forage and parents stop feeding, feeding teaching social interaction. Often sold at this time
Weanling, the bird eats on its own
Juvenile is when hormones start to kick in, not sexually mature and still very malleable
Adolescent can be very tough period and can cause problematic birds if not cared properly
Adult is more stable life stage, less prone to sudden behavioural changes

Social interaction - means interaction within their own flock
Foraging - looking for food
Maintenance - time grooming and bathing, etc.
Sexual behaviours depending on time of year

```
Can stimulate high sex drive, lots of food, lots of spare time, doesn't need to forage, doesn't need to have someone to socialize with, can go stir crazy, need an enriched environment
Important to understand normal and natural behaviours. Try to allow normal expression to solve issues
Very important in the casing of hand rearing
Bad bird selection is often an issue
Try to experience life from the bird's eyes, how does it behave when it spends a lot of time in a cage
Bird see family as part of the flock
Birds don't need to be dominated, need to keep a consistent flock, if you dominate them you can cause future issues
Aviary outside or night cages can help the bird to sleep better
Allowing some time outside can be very nice

Important to handle it gently
Keep ourselves and the bird safe
Use towels to help reduce stress
Don't use gloves unless birds pray
Be very gentle
The towel can help the bird to calm down
Slow and intentional movements
Can have a very long memory so you don't want to stress them and they will always be anxious
Behavioural consults can be challenging and time-consuming
Wise to do health checks to help find a behavioural problem
Questionnaires can help expedite information
Behaviourists can also help, viewing in the home can help
Change consequences to discourage or encourage behaviour

Important to set boundaries
Games to set behaviours
Tricks and interactions are super beneficial
Stepping up and down on the perch
Too much grooming leads to sexual frustration, don't pat head, groom tail, let birds masturbate on them
Some toys can also cause issues

How is the environment set up, what behaviours occur beforehand

Best way to develop good behaviours
Give treats, give rewards, in response to a direct reward
Want to give choices

```
Positive rewards to encourage alternate behaviours
Instead of biting hands give biting stick to change the direction of behaviour

Negative punishment is removing something from the environment
Removing a person doesn't properly work
Negative punishment could be removing treats or toys to change behaviour

Separating aggression can lead to negative reinforcement because you are separating after aggression

Need to ensure that it is not disease-related. Internal pain, skin diseases
Feather pluck is not a positive action

Talk quietly
Screech for social or stress or concern
Natural language
Psychological drugs are never the first-line treatment
