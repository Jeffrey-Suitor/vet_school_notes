More ornamental or very involved in family
Can be bought through breeders or pet shops. Gumtree is bad
People don't often consider the needs of birds

Diseases can alter budgies beak colour
Cockatiels are normally bigger than 10 years
Cockatoos can have beak issues and the most common disease is peak and feather disease. Can often be obese. Live beyond 80 years
Lorikeets need proper sexing, very hyperactive with different diet
Eclectus, males are green, females are red, and need lots of attention. Eat more fruit
Conures can live up to 30 years, can be destructive, can be quiet, can be easy to manage
Macaw is really popular, macaw temperamental, very scared and apprehensive, 60 years or longer

Always start with a healthy bird
Need to see where the bird comes from
Look at the feathers, eye, asymmetrical

```
Get check in first week
Want to give a week of quarantine at least
Check for parasites, run a general check up
Certain species need certain types of testing
No vaccines for parrots in Australia

Vaccination history important for mericks disease
Backyard chickens can use some industry vaccines, but it can be hard to do that
Need to vaccinate at a very young day of age which is tricky to do. 
Sexing is hard, vent sexing is difficult

```
temperature species more stimulated during winter. Tropical species may not do as well in winter
Different types of nesting boxes, like dark boxes
Many species can be monogamous
Several different species across different aviaries, mixing species
Microchips
Healthcare properties
New concepts in breeding, especially in Europe where hand rearing is not allowed

```pdf

"page": 22
```
Wrong nesting boxes may not work or may kill the young or eggs

```pdf

```
Incubating of eggs is very common
Can lead to a second clutch of egg
Incubating can be quite intensive
Hand reared birds are very in demand because they relate very strongly to humans and so they view that as selling birds
Proper temperature, humidity, roll the eggs
Hand rearing around temperature control

```pdf

"page": 24
```
Under 2 weeks of age
Environmental control is super important
Altricial chicks
Illegal to remove in Europe because it has been linked to bad outcomes, leading to behavioural problems, and we can't teach all the babies correctly because we are humans
Ethics behind hand rearing is dubious
Co-parenting allows close interaction with chicks but parents monitor most of the chicks

```pdf

```
It is very important, can use microchips
Health care is important, the single sick bird can be worth it if the bird is very valuable
Can be fed via water or feeders but harder compared to livestock
Closed aviary concept allows to control of risks associated with disease

Very different compared to household pets
Breeder needs to appreciate health needs and training needs
How to quarantine going to and from races
How are the birds going to win races and monitor their health status
Vet can provide info and health checks
