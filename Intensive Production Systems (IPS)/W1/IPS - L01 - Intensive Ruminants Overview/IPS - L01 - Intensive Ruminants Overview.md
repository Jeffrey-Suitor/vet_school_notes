# IPS - L01 - Intensive Ruminants Overview

## IPS - L01

The roof is vital, depending on temperature and precipitation
Temporary or longer-term (feedlot)
Feed types vary between countries, and often include food left over from human processing, dry distillers grain 9DDG), grape marc

Cattle, sheep or goats. Dairy goats is very common to reduce parasite load, small holder, Charley shape

Initially 80% and 20% forages

Roughage, concentrates, supplements

Feedlots are large but dry

Benefits of roller compacted concrete
?
Reduced pen dust
Reduced loss of clay
Less mud in pens

Why manage ruminants intensively
?
1. Animal health - removes parasites such as nematodes from the equation
2. Can allow harvest of feed from a range of places where ruminants may not be allowed to graze (such as small dairies in countries like Nepal)
3. Improves feed conversion ratio, reduces methane production per kilogram growth (in future may also reduce CH4 production using seaweed)
4. Provides regular growth rate and quality control in final meat/milk/fibre production as get routine nutrition and reduces high/low environment issues if in a covered area
5. Short term - need a feed at shows or various exhibitions as lack of grass
6. Containment zone - reduces damage to paddocks during dry periods, maintains stock welfare, allows regular monitoring
7. Other

Outline parasite control
?
Milking goats in the shed is common
Cut and carry for pasture
Removes nematode parasites from the system
Cut and carry may be combined with other feeds
High $ per kg DM
Health issues
Reproduction easier
Less walking needed
Greater biosecurity management

Outline feed harvest elsewhere
?
Smallholder farms may keep animals in a feedlot like a scenario and do a cut-and-carry operation similar to the previous goat example
Access grass in neighbouring areas using manual labour
Livestock may not be able to graze in these areas

Outline improve feed conversion ratio (FCR), reduce CH4
?
Ruminant FCR improves on a feedlot ration - ruminant FCR tends to range from 4.5-7.5 (more variable on forage-based extensive grazing diets)
Depending on genetics and feed type FCR may even be better than this e.g. needing less than 4.5kg DM feed to put on 1kg bodyweight
The feed conversion ratio varies according to genetics, nutrition, environment and other factors
Generally higher FCR in a feedlot scenario
- Less animal movement
- Manage environment

Outline how seaweed can reduce methane output
?
Found that certain types of seaweed produce metabolites that may decrease methane production (burping)
More research to demonstrate benefits and also mechanisms for producing seaweed in quantity and funding
Ability to add to the daily requirement in feedlot compared to extensive

Outline quality insurance for growing in intensive 
?
Most supermarkets and large retailers take beef cattle through feedlots prior to sending them to the abattoir
Ensures consistent growth as they receive a consistent diet compared to grass-fed which may vary significantly
Usually, 60-90 days on grain for the domestic market, manage as a single group (not mixed)

Outline intensive feed at shows/events
?
Folding holding for more than a day using feed/water in pens
Usually predominantly roughage

Outline containment zones
?
Containment zone used when feed is limiting on the property - primary summer/autumn but potentially winter also
Potentially secondary use as an on-farm feedlot for prime stock
Design size varies with species and regularity of use
Must be able to supply roughage and grain base diet, or have troughs where can supply output from mixer wagon or similar
