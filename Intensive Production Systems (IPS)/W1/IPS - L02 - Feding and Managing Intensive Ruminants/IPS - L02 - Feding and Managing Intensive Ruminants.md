# IPS - L02 - Feding and Managing Intensive Ruminants

What are the 4 stages of intensive ruminant management?
?
Pre-induction (backgrounding)
Induction
Feeding
Turn-off/turn-out
Enterprises permanently intensive such as dairy feedlot uses many management factors discussed last semester

Outline backgrounding
?
Preparing stock to later be managed in feedlots/confinement
Yard weaning
Ideally straight from property to background/feedlot (not mixed)
Background cohort on property in feedlot group before arrival
Relevant vaccines prior to feedlot entry so already have immunity before stress and acclimatisation
- Improve - Socialisation, Feed intake, Health (less disease) - particularly respiratory disease
Some enterprises specialise in background stock for feedlots
Some feedlots pay producers a per kilogram rate to manage cattle in groups pre-feedlot entry
One program is shown on the right
Avoid capital outlay for producer
Reduced risk for producers, making sure they are managed on the farm

Outline induction of animals into the intensive feedlot
?
*Quarantine*
*Collection of LPA NVD information and Vendor Declaration*
Record NLIS details
Clean water and fresh roughage (mostly use hay)
*HGP +/-*
Kept in a group or drafted into the group - same weight, age sex, target market/weight
Vaccination/anthelmintic and often *additional ear tag
IPM to control flies (feedlot)
This may include shearing/wigging crutching for sheep
*Feedlot but not containment (HGP only beef)*

Outline parasite control in intensive systems
?
Internal parasites
- Nematodes
- Trematodes (primarily liver fluke)
- Cestodes
External parasites
- Lice
- Flies
- Mites
- Ticks
Range of options - Pour-on, injection or oral

Outline the use of vaccines on feedlots
?
The exact vaccine used depends on the species
Generally, 5 in 1 used, except 7 in 1 likely in intensive dairy for both livestock and people (Leptospirosis is a zoonosis), 6 in 1 potentially sheep containment zone
Also may use vaccine against respiratory disease BRD- bacterial and/or viral
Potential pinkeye vaccine
Ideally, use in the pre-feedlot period so that immune response is present prior to arrival at the feedlot

Outline adaptation to intensive diet
?
The routine diet in intensive feeding predominantly consists of grain due to its lower cost c/MJ
However, introduction to the feedlot commences with primary roughage and gradually builds up the grain component over the first few weeks and months
The final diet will depend on the required growth rate and end market
For containment feeding it will be about meeting maintenance while for a feedlot it is about performance (milk/ meat)

What is homeohemylitica (BRD)
?
respiratory and kills within 24/48 hours, 3-4 weeks after stress, solved via optimal nutrition, vaccination, 
- weaning 
- adult prior to sale, 
- adult prior to feedlot entry
Without vaccination, there can be setbacks
Lung lesions at slaughter

Outline feed budget
?
Labour is not included in this budget, important to recognise this cost somewhere
Assume feed cost includes depreciation on yards and cost to feed, not just purchase price
Introductory feed, value at purchase, death rates
Animal health problems in intensive environments
Interest
Break-even price
Will want to get the price in advance to keep the study

Outline grain introduction as grain percentage
?
20 - 1 to 4 days
40 - day 5 to 8
60 - 9 to 12
80 - 13 to 15
Final diet day 16
Consistency is key

Outline bunk space per head
?
Requirements are in place to ensure all animals are able to access feed without bullying
For sheep in feedlot fed ad lib 3 cm is required per head, on lower feed rations up to 30cm per head needed
 
| ---                  | Feed throughs | Self feeders |
| -------------------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| Yearling             | 25 to 30      | 10 to 20     |
| 18 months to 2 years | 30 to 38      | 20 to 25     |
| Bullocks             | 38 to 46      | 25 to 30     |

Whole cottonseed increases protein

Beef cattle feedlots above and beyond require beef lot requirements
?
Documentation around personal
Food
Water
Training
National Beef Cattle Feedlot Environmental Code of Practice

Outline tools to assess heat load index risk
?
Heat load is one of the biggest potential issues around feedlots
Fat animals almost ready for slaughter often at the most risk, particularly if the dark colour
Shade
Wind

Outline stock inspection
?
Pen riders
Regular stock inspection by trained observers
Animal health (particularly BRD)
Remove any sick animals early

In Victora, Australia there are two large commercial feedlots, both in northern Victoria but with numerous smaller, opportunity or continually stocked lots.  Most of the larger cattle feedlots (with tens of thousands of cattle) are located in the grain belt (sheep/wheat zone) of NSW and QLD.  Ready access to grain and cattle makes this a logical place with cattle processed at abattoirs generally in the same state (depending on feedlot location).
