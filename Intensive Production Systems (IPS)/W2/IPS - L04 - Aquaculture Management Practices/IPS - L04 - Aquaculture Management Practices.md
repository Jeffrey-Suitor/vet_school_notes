## IPS - L04

Outline nutrition. in aquaculture
?
Correct nutrition required for optimal growth, health and reproduction
Complete nutrient requirements only available for select species
Utilisation of proteins, lipids and/or carbohydrates can vary (carp vs. salmon)
Feed costs can represent 40-50% of overall cost (intensive production systems)

Outline live feds
?
Microalgae
- Mostly unicellular
- Isochrysis, Chaetoceros, Tetraselmis
- Rotifers (early protostomes)
- Artemia (crustacea)
- First, feed for many larvae
- A balanced diet and highly palatable
- Can be produced in bulk
- Expensive to purchase (artemia) or maintain in culture (algae)

Outline trash fish feeds
?
Sardines, pilchards and squid
A balanced diet and highly palatable
Supplemented with vitamins and minerals
Often used to condition broodstock
Can represent a substantial cost to production
Global pressure on wild stocks (fish oil and meal)
Risk of introducing disease

Outline Artificial (prepared) feeds
Uniform quality and variable size
Nutrients balanced for maximum growth
easy to store and distribute
generally lower cost
Can be a moist or dry pellet
Often contain fish oil and fish meal (nutritional balance and improved palatability)
50% of the world's fish oil production is fed to farmed salmon

Outline water quality control
?
The primary consideration when culturing aquatic organisms
The physical and chemical properties of water must be carefully monitored to ensure growth and survival
Most important parameters: dissolved oxygen, temperature, and total nitrogen
Others: pH, salinity, alkalinity, hardness, turbidity and pollution (pesticides and herbicides)

Outline the role of dissolved oxygen
?
tolerance varies but > 5 ppm
Low dissolved oxygen can cause
- Hypoxia = stress = death and disease
Dissolved oxygen decreases at higher temperatures and decreases with increased altitude and salinity
Phytoplankton consume oxygen at night and produce oxygen during the day
Can change rapidly in closed systems (ponds)
Intensive aquaculture requires supplemental aeration (equipment and electricity cost)

Outline temperature ranges for fish
?
Cultured species are ectothermic (assume the temperature of their environment)
Affects activity, behaviour, growth and reproduction
In fish, metabolic rates double for every 10C
High temperatures can cause stress = death and disease
Can cause stratification (affects dissolved oxygen)
Buffered in open systems and ocean
Can change rapidly in closed systems (ponds)
Select the right environment for your species

Outline nitrogen waste products
?
Aquatic species excrete nitrogenous waste using gills (primarily as ammonia)
Ammonia (toxic) is converted rapidly to nitrites (NO2) and then nitrates (NO3) by bacteria
Ammonia can cause gill and tissue damage, extreme lethargy and death
This can change rapidly if fish metabolising high protein diets
Nitrogen taken up by aquatic plants - promotes algal blooms (and more toxins)
Dispersed quickly in open systems
Can change rapidly in closed systems (ponds)

Outline diseases in the aquatic environment
?
Fish and shellfish held under high stocking densities are naturally susceptible to infections
Stress is the major contributing factor
Secondary infections are common, and diseases are frequently reported as syndromes of mixed aetiology

How do we monitor disease in the aquatic environment?
?
Signs of disease
- Mass mortality events
- Behavioural change - decreased feeding, change in swimming pattern
- Gross pathology - change in colour, tissue necrosis and secondary infections

Outline the diseases affecting aquaculture
?
Environmental factors
- Hypoxia
- Toxins
Infectious agents
- Virus
- Bacteria
- Fungi
- Parasites

Outline disease management of aquaculture
?
Prevention
- Quarantine - confine new stocks before releasing them into culture tanks
- Regular disease monitoring
- Maintain water quality
- Maintain a stress-free environment
- Vaccination - injectable or bathing
Treatment
- Antibiotics - oral, injectable or bathing
- Salt or freshwater baths
- Others: formalin or other veterinary-prescribed chemicals

Outline the bacteria in aquaculture
?
Often virulent and avirulent strains
Treatment
- Usually oral, injectable or bathing treatment with antibiotics
Prevention
- Vaccination is available for some
- Probiotics - non-pathogenic bacteria
Often a secondary infection
Some primary pathogens need to be carefully monitored
Atypical Aeromonas salmonicida biovar Acheron
- Virulent strains of Aeromonas spp.
- Salmon industry (Macquarie Harbour)
- Blood disease - septicaemia
- Raised fluid-filled lesions and necrosis of the internal organs
- Antibiotics administered orally in feed
- Injectable vaccines available
Vibriosis
- Virulent strains of Vibrio spp.
- Cutaneous and systemic haemorrhages
- The problem in marine hatcheries
- Antibiotics administered orally in feed
- Vaccine available for fish

Outline viruses in Australian aquaculture
?
Australian aquaculture not virus free but many remain exotic
Prevented through strict quarantine procedures
- Impacts fish and shellfish imports into Australia
- Impacts live fish movement between states
Diagnostic protocols used to monitor most viral pathogens (PCR)
Virus isolation is also used by most state and federal laboratories
No treatments of vaccines for viral infections in Australia
Pacific Oyster Mortality Syndrome (POMS)
- Ostreid herpesvirus-1 microvariant
- Pacific oyster production in NSW and Tasmania
- Can cause significant mortalities in entire bays
- Movement of oysters and oyster equipment from high-risk areas requires permits
Viral encephalopathy and retinopathy
- Noda virus infects the brain and ocular tissues of barramundi
- Can cause significant mortalities in larvae and juveniles
- Broodstock and larvae at hatcheries are regularly screened using diagnostic PCR
Gill associated virus
- Family Roniviridae
- Prawn production in Queensland
- Can rapidly become a systemic infection which causes mid-crop mortality syndrome
- Present in wild broodstock, therefore difficult to control
- PCR and monitor water quality - strongly associated with stress events

Outline the fungi in aquaculture
?
Not common in marine/brackish water aquaculture
Observed in freshwater hatcheries 
Epizootic ulcerative syndrome (EUS)
- Affects many freshwater species
- Aphanomyces invadans infection following initial damage
- Monitor water quality

Outline parasites in aquaculture
?
QX disease
- Sydney rock oysters in NSW
- Paramyxean protozoa Mareilia sydneyi
- Prevent movement of oysters and oyster equipment
Amoebic gill disease
- Atlantic salmon in Tasmania
- Marine amoebae attach to gills
- Change to the gill tissue leads to mortalities
- Treat with freshwater bath

Outline the future direction of aquaculture
?
Australia = safe, high-quality seafood, produced using environmentally sustainable practices
High-value domestic and overseas markets
Further processing and identifying packaging to value-add
Increasing demand for high-quality Australian native species (barramundi and abalone) in Asian markets

Outline Australian aquaculture regulations
?
Australian Government manages national programs for:
- Research. - FRDC / CSIRO/AIMS
- Management of biosecurity
- Aquatic animal health
- Food safety
- Environmental management
- Market access and trade
Element of the monitoring and regulation of domestic aquaculture production rest with the states and territories
Regulation of international sale and movement of aquatic species occurs at all levels (state, federal and international partners)

Outline the role of veterinarians in aquaculture
?
Aquatic species are generally not specifically mentioned in Veterinary Surgeons Acts ~ anyone can diagnose and treat fish disease
Fish are covered by medicines legislation so only vets can prescribe medicines for farmed fish
Emerging sector and veterinary surgeons are critical to the growth and sustainability of it
Improving the health status using preventative medicine and biosecurity strategies
- Protecting the health of a population
- Reducing the use of antibiotics
- Maximise health and welfare of aquatic animals
