## IPS - L03

Definition of aquaculture
?
Fish
Crustacea
Molluscs
Seaweeds/Macrophytes
430 species

Outline the state of fisheries
?
Non-sustainable harvest from global fisheries
Only 6% underfished
94$ of fisheries are fully fished or overfished
Non-consistent and sustainable production
No selective breeding for required attributes

What are the advantages of aquaculture production
?
Good food conversion ratio
Sustainable and consistent production of seafood
Selective breeding possible
Produce high-value products (whole tuna $55/kg)
Reduce fishing pressure on wild stocks (salmon and prawns)
Can promote environmental protection of coastlines (oyster and mussel farms)

What are the disadvantages of aquaculture
?
Use of limited resources - conflict with other users of water bodies
Relatively high cost of labour using intensive culture methods
Increases fishing pressure on some wild species (anchovies for the production of fish meal and oil)
Can affect sensitive water systems with excess nutrients, chemicals and escapees

What are the aquaculture products
?
Food
- Meat (fish, shellfish, and oysters)
- Oil (fish oils)
- Eggs (caviar/salmon roe)
Plant products (nori, wakame, agar, spirulina)
Aquarium trade (ornamental species)
Juveniles to restock fisheries
Other products (pearls and shells, sponges, carotenoids and fertilisers)

Why is aquaculture important
?
Aquatic species are major sources of protein
- 17% animal protein
- 7% of all protein consumed
High-value food - salmon, tuna, abalone, caviar/roe
High-value products, e.g. pearls, ornamental species

Outline captive fisheries vs aquaculture
?
Global aquaculture production: 81.2 million tonnes of aquatic animals (46% of global production)
Average growth 5.3 per cent per annum

Outline the species produced by aquaculture
?
Molluscs 15%
Freshwater fish 39%
Aquatic plants 29%

Who produces the most aquaculture
?
China, Indonesia, India
120 million tonnes of aquaculture produced globally in 2019
China is the largest producer of aquaculture products (68.4 million tonnes)

What are the common species cultured globally
?
Freshwater
- Common carp
- Nile tilapia
Diadromous
- Atlantic salmon
- Rainbow trout
Marine
- Brown and red seaweeds - Japanese kelp, nori
- Oysters - edible and pearl
- Mussels
- Prawns

Outline Australian aquaculture production
?
0.1% of world aquaculture
Production mostly in coastal and estuarine regions
Mostly marine and estuarine (brackish water) species

What are the key species grown in Australia
?
More than 40 species
Finfish
- Atlantic salmon
- Southern bluefin tuna
- Barramundi
Crustaceans:
- Prawns
Molluscs
- Pearl oysters
- Edible oysters
- Abalone
The value of salmon production increasing
1.42 billion in total value

Anatomy of aquatic organisms
?
Taxa are distantly related 
Anatomy, immunology, and physiology are distantly related

Who catches the majority of fish in Australia
?
Tasmania, Western Australia, Southern Australia

Outline Tasmanian salmon farming
?
The largest contributor to Australian aquaculture production
60% of animals and value
Salmonids (aquaculture)
Southern Rock lobster (wild catch)
Abalone (wild-catch)

Outline South Australian tuna farming
?
9% of aquaculture production and 8.8% of the value
Southern Rock Lobster (wild catch)
Southern Bluefin Tuna (aquaculture)
Prawns (wild-catch)

What are the aquaculture production considerations
?
1. Seed stock
2. Habitat preference (production systems0)
3. Nutrition
4. Water quality
5. Disease surveillance and control

Outline aquaculture seed production
?
Wild capture
- No selection of traits
- Cheap but supply erratic
- Broodstock (prawns)
- Juveniles (tuna)
Domesticated
- Closed life cycles
- Selection of traits (growth rate and disease resistance)
- Constant supply but higher cost

Outline habitat preferences
?
The design of the production system depends on the species
Benthic, intertidal or open ocean

Outline extensive culture systems
?
Depend on natural food and water exchange (tide)
Receive no intentional nutritional inputs
Lowest cost of production
Low stocking densities
Yield can vary (available food, climate change)
Animal health difficult to manage

Outline semi-intensive culture systems
?
Natural food but increased by supplementary feed
Provide partial nutritional requirements e.g. fertilisation, feeding twice/week
Water quality requires monitoring and aeration often required
Medium stocking densities
Timing of harvest and production yield can be managed
Improved disease management 9easier to monitor e.g. feed trays)

Outline intensive culture systems
?
Depend on nutritionally complete diets
- Trash/feed fish
- Formulated diets, usually in dry pelleted form
- high stocking densities can be achieved (dependent on species tolerance)
- Environmental conditions are constantly monitored and adjusted (water temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH and salinity)
- Disease management essential at a high stocking density

Outline permaculture
?
Integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) includes organisms from different trophic levels of an ecosystem (e.g. fish, shellfish, algae) so that the byproducts of one become the inputs of another
Aquaponics (barramundi and hydroponic lettuce)

Outline line systems
?
Extensive culture and open system in preferred habitat
Growout of juvenile/adult species
Larvae produced in the hatchery (intensive culture) and settled on the substrate (pearl oysters)
Low production cost
Constant water exchange and dispersion of waste
Difficult to manage the water quality of disease

Outline rack systems
?
Extensive culture and open system in preferred habitat
Intertidal species (littoral zone)
Larvae produced in the hatchery (intensive culture system) and settled on the substrate (edible oysters)
Low production cost
Constant water exchange and dispersion of waste
Difficult to manage water quality and disease

Outline cage systems
?
Semi-intensive and intensive culture and open system in preferred habitat
Freshwater, brackish or marine
Netting: nylon, PVC coated polyester, brass or galvanised steel
Constant water exchange and dispersion of waste
Higher costs operating intensive production offshore
Feed wastage leads to higher food conversion ratios
Difficult to manage water quality and disease

Outline pond systems
?
Semi-closed or closed system
Semi-intensive and intensive production
Usually requires some regular input of clean water and removal of waste
Easier to monitor and control water quality and disease
Temperature and levels of dissolved oxygen and waste can rapidly change
Costs higher (land purchase, pumps aerators and electricity)

Outline hatchery systems
?
Hatchery - larvae produced in a controlled environment
Semi-closed or closed system
Recirculating systems improve disease management
Intensive production
Simple to monitor and control water quality and disease
Expensive (water, land purchase, pumps, aerators and electricity)
Systems not cost effect for grow out
