## Necrosis and Apoptosis

What is cell degeneration::the result of sublethal injury, results in a reversible morphologic change

What is cell death::severe or progressive injury, irreversible cellular changes

What are the forms of irreversible injury?
?
Cell membrane damage -> swelling mitochondria, ER, lysosomes, PM
Cytoskeletal damage -> swelling, dissociation
Mitochondrial dysfunction -> amorphous densities
Release of **lysosomal enzymes** -> cell damage
**Nuclear** changes -> condensation/fragmentation

What is **necrosis** = the **death of cells** in a **living** organism

What are the morphologic changes involved in oncotic necrosis
?
Cytoplasm
- **Eosinophilia** - loss of cytoplasmic RNA; denatured cytoplasmic proteins
- **Vacuolation** - digestion of cytoplasmic organelles by liberated enzymes
- **Mineralization** - degradation of membrane phospholipids > FA accumulation
Nucleus: **Pykonosis** (shrinkage) > **Karyorrhexis** (fragmentation) > **Karyorrlysis** (fading)

When does detectable evidence of necrosis occur
?
1. Serum biochemistry (< 1/2 hours)
2. Ultrastructural changes (1/2 - 4 hours)
3. Light microscopic changes (4-12 hours)
4. Gross changes (12-24 hours)

Outline the process of necrosis due to ischemic injury in renal tubules
?
Early/Reversible: Cell swelling, surface blebs, cytoplasmic eosinophilia
Necrosis: Cell loss, cell fragmentation, pyknosis, Karyorrlysis

Outline the histological appearance of canine parvovirus
?
Lymphocytes
Necrosis: pyknosis, karyorrhexis, karyorrlysis

Outline the histological appearance of chloroform toxicity in mice
?
Tubular epithelial cells demonstrating 
- hydropic degeneration
- Necrosis
  - Pykonsis
  - Karyorrlysis

What are the types of coagulative necrosis?
?
Hypoxia, **ischemia**, toxins
Denaturation of cellular protein including lysosomal enzymes > retention of tissue architecture**
Infarction reflects obstruction of blood supply to a region of an organ > coagulative necrosis of the affected region
Subacute to chronic renal infarcts: loss of tissue/fibrosis **scarring**

What is caseous necrosis
?
Infectious -> Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis = Cheesy gland = caseous lymphadenitis
Caseous = Cheese like
The chronic form of necrosis
Loss of tissue architecture
Loss of cellular detail

Describe the gross histological appearance of caseous necrosis
?
Cheese like appearance
Fibrous layer surrounding these cheese-like nodules

What is liquefactive necrosis
?
cells are lysed and the necrotic tissue is converted to a **liquid phase**
Common in **pyogenic bacterial infections**, cat bite abscess
Oncotic necrosis in the brain and spinal cord > typically manifests as liquefactive necrosis
lack of a **fibrous interstitium** to uphold tissue structure
Cells for the CNS tend to be rich in lipids and lytic enzymes
The gross appearance of softened, necrotic tissue in the CNS is **malacia**
All that remains under histology are blood vessels and macrophages

Outline Polioencephalomalacia
?
Adult doe (goat)
recumbency, inability to stand, abnormal limb movement, non-responsive, start-gazing (opisthotonos)
yellowish colour
Necrotic tissue will autofluorescent under ultraviolet light due to the presence of lipid metabolites and high molecular weight collagen material

What is gangrenous necrosis?
?
**Gangrene** is a relatively old term = for tissue necrosis
Three main types
- **Dry** gangrene
  - Coagulative necrosis develops in tissue with impaired blood supply (ischemia)
- **Wet** gangrene
  - Necrotic tissue is infected by **bacteria** - haemorrhage, oedema
- **Gas** gangrene
  - **Bacterial** infection in tissues producing **gas** - *Clostridium spp*

Outline the gross appearance of gangrenous necrosis
?
Dry: Distal limbs Vasoconstriction with necrosis Ergot alkaloids via endophyte-infected fescue grass
Wet: Mammary gland **Bacterial infection** with toxin synthesis, necrosis and haemorrhage *Staphylococcus spp*
Gas: Thigh muscle - black leg **bacterial infection** with toxin synthesis, necrosis, haemorrhage and gas production *Clostridium chauvoei* = black leg

Outline the causes of fat necrosis 
?
Nutritional: a diet high in unsaturated fatty acids and low in vitamin E or other antioxidants > ROS synthesis
Enzymatic: Peripancreatic - releases of lipases from the damaged pancreas
Traumatic - vascular
Idiopathic - retroperitoneal fat in ruminants

What are the impacts of necrosis
?
**location** of the injury within the affected tissue
**Extent** of the injury
**Retention** of the supporting tissue architecture: kidney tubular damage and retention/loss of tubular basement membrane
**Regenerative capacity** of the injured tissue: liver vs brain

What is autolysis
?
No necrosis
**Self-digestion** of tissues: Releases of enzymes into the cytoplasm after death
**Variation** in rate and degree: the content of proteolytic enzymes
Tissue most vulnerable: *GIT*, pancreas, liver, kidney vs muscle
Microscopic changes closely **resemble** those of necrosis: diffuse
With the proliferation of bacteria: **putrefaction**

What is apoptosis
?
**Regulated** form of cell death
**Programmed** or directed process
Important in 
- Embryologic development
- Homeostasis
- Involution of tissues
- Response to certain types of injury
- Oncology

What are the mechanisms of apoptosis?
?
**Extrinsic** pathway: Death ligands include:
- **FAS** via Tc cells
- **TNF** which is a cytokine
- **Perforin, granzymes, granulysin** via Tc cells
**Intrinsic pathway**
- **Growth factor withdrawal
- **DNA damage**
- ROS, radiation, toxins
- **Misfolded proteins**

Outline physiologic apoptosis
?
Apoptosis **permits** the separation of mammalian digits during foetal development
Failure of apoptosis - Congenital syndactyly

Outline mammary involution
?
Following the weaning of suckling animals - secretory parenchyma of the mammary gland undergoes involution via apoptosis

Outline the involution of tissues in the thymus: thymus undergoes physiologic involution via apoptosis when it is no longer needed after puberty

Outline the involution of the lymph node::Is the lymphocyte we need not in the germinal centre then it will undergo apoptosis in the germinal centre dark zone

Describe pathologic apoptosis
?
Immune mediated disease: Canine-Skin- erythema multiforme, TEN
Viral infection: Murine - liver - mouse hepatitis virus - Necrosis and apoptosis. Virus causes hepatocellular death, typically by oncotic necrosis but sometimes by apoptosis

What is the difference between necrosis vs Apoptosis
?
Necrosis :
- Response to **irreversible** innjury (pathologic)
  - **Accidental** and **random** process
  - **Inactive** process - ATP depletion
    - Involves **groups** of cells
- Cell membranes **disrupted**
Apoptosis:
- **Removal** of excess cells (Physiologic)
  - Can be a **response** to injury
  - **regulated** and **Programmed** process
    - **Active** - requires energy/ATP
      - Involves **individual** cells
      - Cell membranes **intact**

What is dystrophic  mineralisation
?
Deposition of **calcium** salts in soft tissues
Accumulation of hard, white, gritty mineral
Microscopically see granular basophilic (blue) material
**Dystrophic** = calcification of necrotic tissue
- &&Normal** serum calcium and phosphate levels
- Failure to regulate energy-dependent intracellular calcium balance
- Association of calcium with lipid deposits from degenerate cell membranes (phospholipids) extracellular

What is metastatic mineralization
?
**Metastatic** = soft tissue calcification
- Result of elevated serum calcium concentration (Ca/Phos imbalance)
Mineral deposited in **blood vessels**
- lungs, pleura, endocardium, kidneys, and stomach
**Renal** disease
- Phosphate retention > calcium phosphate imbalance
**Vitamin D toxicosis**
- Rodenticide ingestion, toxic plants (vitamin D - like)
**Neoplasia**
- Excess synthesis of parathyroid hormone or PTH-like hormones (lymphoma in dogs, PTH-like compound)
