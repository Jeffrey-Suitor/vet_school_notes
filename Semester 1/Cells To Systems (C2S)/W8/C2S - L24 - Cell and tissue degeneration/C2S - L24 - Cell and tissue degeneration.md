## Cell and Tissue Degeneration

What is the role of the cell membrane in homeostasis::essential in homeostasis by regulating what substances enter and leave the cell and its organelles

What are some of the causes of cell injury?
?
Hypoxia
- Impaired blood flow - cardiac disease/ischemia
- Impaired O2 transport - respiratory disease/anemia/toxins
Physical agents
- Trauma, thermal, UV radiation, ionising radiation
Microbes
- Viruses, bacteria - toxins fungi, helminths, protozoa
Inflammation and immunologic dysfunction
Nutritional imbalances
Genetic derangement
- Lysosomal storage disease
Workload imbalance
Chemicals, drugs, toxins
Aging
Combination - potentiating

How will mitochondrial damage cause cell injury::Decrease in ATP and increase in ROS leading to damage to lipids, proteins, and DNA

What are some of the results of cell membrane damage?
?
Entry of Ca2+
- Increased mitochondrial permeability
- Activation of multiple cellular enzymes
Membrane damage
- Plasma membrane -> loss of cellular components
- Lysosomal membrane -> Enzymatic digestion of cellular components
Protein misfolding, DNA damage -> Activation of pro-apoptotic proteins

Describe the process of ATP depletion
?
Caused by ischemia or infarction which leads to reduce blood supply to the cells
This reduces the amount of oxygen available for oxidative phosphorylation leading to decreased ATP production causing:
- Na+ pump decrease -> Influx of Ca2+, H20, and Na+, Efflux of K+ -> ER swelling, cellular swelling, loss of microvilli, blebs
- Increase anaerobic glycolysis
  - Decreased glycogen
  - Increased lactic acetic
  - Decreased ph -> Clumping of nuclear chromatic
- Detachment of ribosomes -> decreased protein synthesis

Describe the production of reactive oxygen species in cell injury
?
Normally ROS is regulated
Injury increases ROS
ROS leaks out of the cell causing:
- Lipid peroxidation -> membrane damage
- Protein modification -> Breakdown, misfolding
- DNA damage -> mutations

Outline the change in cell morphology with respect to time
?
Cells may become rapidly non-functional after injury
May still be viable with reversible changes
Irreversible biochemical changes may cause cell death and these changes usually precede the development changes via EM, light microscope or grossly
Reversible -> Irreversible
Cell function decreases -> Biochemical alterations/cell death -> Ultrastructural changes -. Light microscopic changes -> Gross morphologic changes

Outline reversible cell injury
?
Reversible injury -> swelling of the cell
Damage to membrane ion pumps:
- Swollen mitochondria, ER, lysosomes
- Changes to the plasma membrane
Altered protein synthesis
- Accumulation of metabolites
Nuclear changes
- Clumped chromatin

Outline irreversible cell injury
?
Irreversible cell injury -> Cell death
Cell membrane damage
- Swelling mitochondria, ER, lysosomes, PM
Cytoskeletal damage
- Swelling dissociation
Mitochondrial dysfunction
- Amorphous densities
Release of lysosomal enzymes
- Cell damage
Nuclear changes
- condensation/fragmentation

Outline the process of acute cell in reversible cell injury
?
Reversible
Most often reflects hypoxia but also cell membrane injury
Hypoxia
- Largely reflects decreased ATP -> impaired Na+/K+- ATPase pumps
  - influx Na+, Ca++ accompanied by H20
  - efflux K+, MG++
- Decrease ATP -> switch to anaerobic metabolism
  - Reduced glycogen in the cell
  - Decreased pH
Cell membrane injury
- Lipid peroxidation, toxin binding, transmembrane complexes, ion channel disruption

Describe the morphological change in acute cell swelling

Cloudy swelling: swollen, cloudy appearance to cell, sodium potassium pump fails causing increased osmotic pressure, leading to swelling
Hydropic degeneration: liver, renal tubular epithelium, pancreatic islet cells
Ballooning degeneration: the epidermis and upper alimentary tract (keratinocytes)
Cytotoxic oedema: astrocytes in CNS

How does sublethal injury in a hepatocyte appear::Grossly liver will be enlarged, pale, and present with a lobular pattern

Outline the appearance of ballooning degeneration in pig skin::Keratinocytes with ballooning degeneration and eosinophilic cytoplasmic viral inclusion bodies. Ballooning degeneration develops before vesicle formation

Outline the appearance of ballooning degeneration in the oral mucosa::Epithelial cells of the stratum spinosum. At an earlier stage, these cells may contain intracytoplasmic eosinophilic parapoxvirus inclusions

Outline the process of cytotoxic oedema
?
Only found in astrocytes in the CNS
Accumulation of ammonia 
Caused by liver disease (hepatic encephalopathy)
1. ammonia is taken up by astrocytes 
2. converted to osmotically active **glutamine**
3. Causes cytotoxic astrocytic swelling
4. Rise in intracranial pressure and compromised astrocytic function 

What occurs after acute cell swelling
?
Depends upon
- **number** of cells affected 
- **regenerative capabilities** of the cell, brain and heart vs. liver and kidney
The outcome of the injurious insult can be
- **Recover and regain function**, back to normal after removal
- If severe, lengthy or repetitive injury see
  - Impaired cell metabolism with **intracellular accumulations**
  - **Irreversible cell damage and cell death**

Describe intracellular accumulations
?
Lipid, glycogen, protein, and pigment build up inside the cell
Cells can accumulate intracellular material via:
- Disturbance/s to metabolism -> accumulation of by-products
- Genetic mutations
  - Accumulation of abnormal product
  - Inability to process intracellular by-product
- Exogenous substances
Can be innocuous but may be harmful

Outline the process of lipidosis/steatosis/fatty change
?
Range of tissues but liver especially
Possible mechanisms
1. Increased delivery of FFAs
2. Decreased utilisation of FFA
3. Decreased synthesis of apoprotein
4. Decreased (impaired) lipoprotein formation
5. Decreased release of lipoproteins
3 4 5 most common sites - require energy and protein

Decrease the appearance of lipidosis in a cat liver
?
Uniformly pale yellow or tan in colour
Enlarged with rounded edges
Budges on incision
May feel greasy
If lipidosis is severe, the affected tissue may float in a formalin fixative

Outline the diffuse lipidosis
?
Diffuse lipidosis often reflects the increased mobilisation of free fatty acids
**Negative energy balance** resulting in mobilisation of fat reserves
Periparturient cow - ketosis or pregnancy toxaemia in sheep
More common in pregnant animals due to high energy needs

Describe the appearance of lipidosis/steatosis/fatty change in a histological section
?
Hepatocytes contain unstained, sharply defined cytoplasmic lipid vacuoles that displace the nucleus to the periphery of the cell

Describe the appearance of localised lipolysis 
?
Tension lipidosis (steatosis) - incidental finding 
Ligamentous attachment adjacent to the affected portion -> regional hypoxia

Distribution of the stored material and hence organs affected depends on **the tissue where most of the material to be degraded is found and the location where most of the degradation normally occurs**
The brain is rich in gangliosides - > primary accumulation within neurons -> neurologic deficits
Mucopolysaccharides widely distributed -> accumulation. every organ -> range of clinical impacts

What are amyloids
?
**Extracellular** deposits of fibrillar protein -> tissue damage and functional compromise
Abnormal folding of proteins which become insoluble and aggregate to from fibrils (amyloid)
Deposited in the extracellular space 
All amyloid proteins have a similar appearance and staining
- 28 proteins can form the amyloid fibrils - amyloidogenic 
Proteins that form amyloid fall into two general categories 
- **normal proteins** with an inherited tendency to fold improperly
- **mutant** proteins that are prone to misfolding and aggregation

What are the 4 forms of amyloids
?
AA - most common form in animals - reactive - associated with chronic inflammation, formed via **serum amyloid A** - acute phase protein via liver/inflammation
AL - most common in humans - occasionally animals, formed via lambda or **kappa light chains** - plasma cell neoplasia
IAPP - deposited in pancreatic islets of cats and primates, formed via **islet amyloid polypeptide** - secreted by $\beta$ cells in pancreas
AB amyloid - Cerebral plaques and cerebral blood vessels - Alzheimer's in humans and dementia in dogs
Histologically they are the same
