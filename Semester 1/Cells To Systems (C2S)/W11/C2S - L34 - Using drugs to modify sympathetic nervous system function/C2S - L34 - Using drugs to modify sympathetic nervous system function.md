# C2S - L34 - Using drugs to modify sympathetic nervous system function

## Intended Learning Outcomes
- Describe the synthesis, storage, uptake and metabolism of the major natural catecholamines and how certain drugs are able to modulate sympathetic NS activity through the alteration of these processes
- Describe, in a more detailed way, how adrenoceptors are divided into subtypes and the pharmacological basis for this division and how they are responsible for the major physiological roles of the sympathetic NS and circulating adrenaline
- Describe the basic signal transduction mechanisms that adrenoceptors employ to produce their functional effects

Where can you target drugs?
?
Nerve -> transmitter (Synthesis, storage, release and inactivation)
Target -> Receptors (Agonists and Antagonists)
Response -> Coupling (Ligand, G protein-coupled)

Outline adrenaline vs noradrenaline (Catecholamines)
?
Adrenaline (Adrenergic)
- Found in blood
- Mimicked sympathetic nerves
- Isolated from adrenal extracts
- A hormone released by SNS
Noradrenaline
- Not as abundant in the blood
- Mimicked sympathetic nerves
- Synthesised in most postganglionic sympathetic nerves

Outline catecholamine synthesis
?
Tyrosine -- Tyrosine hydoxylase -> L-dihydroxyphenlalaninie (L-DOPA) -- DOPA decarboxylase -> Dopamine -- Dopamine B-hydroxylase -> Noradrenaline
In the adrenal gland (and some nerves in the brain) Phenyltethanolamine-N-methyl transferase converts Noradrenaline to Adrenaline

What is impacted by L-DOPA deficiency
?
Used for Parkinson's disease
Role of dopamine as a neurotransmitter in motor control in CNS
L-DOPA and not dopamine because can't cross the blood-brain barrier

Outline noradrenaline inactivation uptake
?
Action potential initiated exocytotic release
Neuronal -> High affinity (90-95% recaptured) (Cocaine, Desipramine)
Extraneuronal -> Low affinity
CNS actions: mood elevation, addiction, antidepressant drugs but also impacts the cardiovascular system

What are the two enzymes important to uptake and metabolism?
?
Neuronal -> Mono Amine Oxidase
Extraneuronal -> Catechol-O-methyl transferase + Monoamine oxidase
Moclobemide can inhibit monoamine oxidase
MAO inhibitors act as antidepressants
MAO in the gut role of inactivating amines, Food/drug interactions "cheese reaction" has profound effects on blood pressure

Outline indirectly acting sympathomimetics
?
Tyramine is present in foodstuff, but normally broken down by MAO
When MAO is inhibited it releases NA leading to stimulating
Tyramine, Ephedrine, and AMphetamine all act in the same way

Outline the selectivity of noradrenaline and adrenaline
?
Alpha adrenoceptors -> NA > Adr
Beta adrenoceptors -> Adr > NA
- Smooth muscle relaxation: Adr > NA
- Hear rate increase: Adr = NA
  - Subtypes of B adrenoceptors have been identified
    - Selective synthetic agonists and antagonists
    - Gene sequencing

Compare A1, A2.  B1 and B2 adrenoceptors
B1 = heart and kidneys
B2 = skeletal BV, bronchi
A1 = Blood vessels, pupil, GIT
A2 = Nerves (inhibit transmitter release)
All adrenoceptors are G protein-coupled

Outline prejunctional A1 adrenoceptors inhibit transmitter noradrenaline release
?
Action potential initiated exocytotic release
Ca2+ channel inhibition, Gi-coupled
Autoinhibition by noradrenaline
Discovered Clonidine and Xylazine (used as vets)

What drugs to use in A2 adrenoceptors drugs
?
Agonist: Xylazine - veterinary sedative
Antagonist: Yohimbine - Xylazine reversal

Outline drugs for A1 and A2 subtypes
?
A1 adrenoceptor selective (vascular smooth muscle)
Agonists: phenylephrine
- Nasal decongestant
- Raise blood pressure (iv emergency) -> potential bradycardia reflex
Antagonists: prazosin - hypertension
A2 adrenoceptor selective; nerve terminal
Agonist: Clonidine
- Hypertension, CNS action (sedation)
Antagonists: Yohimbine

Outline B adrenoceptor therapeutics
?
B1 adrenoceptor selective (heart, kidney)
Agonists: dobutamine
- Partial agonist
- heart failure (acute)
Antagonists: metoprolol
- Hypertension, angina, anxiety
- heart failure (chronic)
B2 adrenoceptor selective (smooth muscle)
Agonists: salbutamol
- Asthama but cardiac palpitations (90:10 b1:b2 ratio in heart)
- Antagonists: None in therapeutic use

Outline adrenaline and noradrenaline selectivity
?
a1 > b1 ~ a2 >> b2
In nerves to perform specific tasks when required
**Great transmitter but not a great drug**
Adrenaline
b2 ~ b1 ~ a1 > a2
Emergency hormone - improves airway function, promotes blood flow, stimulates metabolism. All the features of the flight or flight response
**LIfe-saving drug - severe allergic reactions** Also added to local anaesthetic solutions

Outline the molecular aspects of adrenergic receptors
?
Different genes for reach receptor subtype
- Unique amino acid sequence
- 7 transmembrane spanning regions
All G protein-coupled receptors
- Specific 2nd messenger pathways

olol -> B1 adrenoceptor

B2 is not recommended because of its negative effects

Outline b1 adrenoceptor signalling in the cardiac myocyte
?
Receptor changes in disease -> downregulation/desensitisation
Phosphodiesterase inhibitors for heart failure
Can promote the influx of calcium
Needed for acute failure

What will Milrinone do
?
Inhibit phosphodiesterase -> more cAMP -> more calcium influx
Good for acute heart failure
