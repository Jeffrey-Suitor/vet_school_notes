# C2S - L33 - Introduction to the peripheral nervous system â€“ autonomic and somatic nervous systems

## Intended Learning Outcomes
- Describe the basic anatomy of the Peripheral NS (efferent), the Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) and its Parasympathetic and Sympathetic divisions 
- Describe the major neurotransmitters and receptors involved in chemical transmission within the ANS and somatic NS 
- List examples of agonists and antagonists that have selective activity at adrenoceptors

Outline the autonomic nervous system
?
Parasympathetic (Cranio/Sacral) -> Long preganglionic fibre, ganglia near/in tissue (heart, glands, eye, smooth muscle: gut, airway)
Sympathetic (Thoracic/Lumbar) -> Short preganglionic fibre, ganglia remote from tissue (sweat glands, heart, eye, smooth muscle: gut, vascular), adrenal gland fed directly
Somatic, Motor -> Single fibre to muscle

Outline the physiology of the peripheral nervous system
?
Somatic-skeletal muscle -> posture and movement
Autonomic. - All other tissues -> homeostasis (housekeeping)
Parasympathetic - anabolic, rest and repose
Sympathetic - catabolic, fight or flight neural and humoral elements
Nerves have specific actions at target tissues

Outline the postganglionic tissue responses in the Autonomic nervous system
?
| Tissue      | Parasympathetic | Sympathetic                  |
| ----------- | --------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Heart       | Decrease        | Increase                     |
| Arteries    |                 | Constriction, dilation (Adr) |
| Bronchi     | Constrict       | Dilation   (Adr)             |
| GIT         | Increase        | Decrease                     |
| Pupil       | Constriction    | Dilation                     |
| Transmitter | Ach             | Noradrenaline                |
| Receptor    | muscarinic      | alpha or beta                             |

Outline the chemical and electrical signalling in nerves
?
Action potential: electrical potential moves along the nerve
Neurotransmitter: chemical at the nerve ending

What type of receptors does the parasympathetic use::ACh and nicotinic -> Ach muscarinic

What type of neurotransmitter and receptors does skeletal muscle use::ACh and nicotinic

What type of receptors and transmitters does the sympathetic nervous system use
?
Sweat glands: ACh and Muscarinic
heart, eye, smooth muscle: gut and vascular: NA and alpha and beta
Adrenal gland: ACh and nicotinic + Adr/NA

Effects of Ach on Cat blood pressure
?
Receptors: Tissue distribution and innervation, muscarinic receptors on endothelial cells release NO
Drugs; ACtion and selectivity


Outline cholinergic receptor localisation and action
?
Autonomic nervous system
- Muscarinic receptors
  - Parasympathetic neuroeffector junction
    - Slow responses - G protein-coupled, second messengers, Salivation, Lacrimation, Urination, Daefaction (SLUD)
- Also endothelial cells
  - Not innervated, can release NO
- Nicotinic receptors
  - Autonomic ganglia (Sympathetic and parasympathetic)
    - Fast responses - Ligand-gated ion channels, Action potential initiation
Skeletal neuromuscular junction
- Nicotinic receptors
  - Fast responses - Ligand-gated ion channel, skeletal muscle contraction

Outline adrenoceptor localisation and action
?
Alpha 
- Blood vessels - constrict
- Pupil (dilates) - constrict
- GIT - constrict sphincters
Beta
- Heart - increased rate and force
- Kidney - renin secretion
- Skeletal BV's - dilate (circulating Adr)
- Bronchi - dilate (circulating Adr)

Outline the autonomic nervous system
?
Contrasting effects of sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves in tissues due to different transmitters
Discrete respones for each divison
- Parasympathetic: acetylcholine, rest and repose responses
- Sympathetic: noradrenaline, fight or flight responses (also involving circulating Adr release)
- Receptors may be present in tissues that are not directly innervated
  - Muscarinic receptors on the endothelium
  - B adrenoceptors in airways
In tissues receiving dual innervation (relative activity depends on needs of organ/tissue)
Nerves modulate activity - Pacemaker activity in the heart, GIT motility

Outline autonomic control of heart rate at rest
?
Atropine block of muscarinic receptors, greater
Propanolol block of B adrenoceptors, lesser
Parasympathetic greater influence on resting heart rate
If you add the heart will continue to beat at about 100 bpm

Outline the role of adrenoceptors in cardiac response
?
Noradrenaline blood pressure increase can trigger reflex slowing of the heart
Direct B-effect can be offset by increased parasympathetic activity
Noradrenaline is a large constriction of blood vessels
Adrenaline constricts and then dilates blood vessels
Nor adrenaline doesn't impact the heart rate (because the heart will reflexively slow to counteract the effect)
Adrenaline increases heart rate
Select inhibition of alpha effect by phentolamine
Selective inhibition of beta effect by propranolol

Outline alpha and beta receptors
?
Subtle differences between Noradrenaline and Adrenaline
- Agonist receptor selectivity
  - NA >= Adr at alpha adrenoceptors
  - Adr >= NA at B adrenoceptors
- Selective inhibition of 
  - BP increase by phentolamine
  - BP decrease and HR increase by propranolol
  - Antagonist receptor selectivity
    - Phentolamine alpha adrenoceptors
    - Propranolol Beta adrenoceptors

Outline the synthetic agonists with adrenoceptor selectivity
?
Phenylephrine: Very effective at constricting vessels but doesn't impact heart rate (selective alpha-adrenoceptor agonist)
Isoprenaline: Good at stimulating the heart but does not constrict blood vessels (selective beta-adrenoceptor agonist)

Outline the therapeutic use of drugs with the selectivity for Beta adrenoceptors over alpha adrenoceptors
?
Agonist: Isoprenaline
- Aerosol trialled in asthmatics
  - Airway benefit offset by cardiac effects (cardiac palpitations)
  - Salbutamol now used for bronchodilation (selectivity for airways, partial agnonist)
Antagonist: Propranolol
- Reduce cardiac output for hypertension (cardiac benefit offset by airway effect)
- Still used clinically, but not if patient has asthma (specific contraindications)
