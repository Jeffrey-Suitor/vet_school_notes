# C2S - L32 - Pharmacodynamic principles of drug action

## Intended Learning Outcomes
- Describe how drugs can influence the function of cell, tissues and organs (Pharmacodynamics)
- Describe processes by which the body may influence the actions of a drug (Pharmacokinetics)
- Describe the importance of the concentration-response curve in characterising the action of drugs

## Pharmacodynamics

What are the types of drugs?
?
Made by the body: Adrenaline 
- Increases heart rate
- Dilates airways
- Initiate dysrhythmia 
- *Adrenal gland*
Made by chemists: Salbutamol
- Dilates airways
- May increase heart rate
- *Synthetic molecule*
Made by plants: Atropine
- Dilated pupils attractive
- Dry mouth, photophobia, hallucinations, death
- *Deadly nightshade*

T/F drugs only have one action::False, always have more than one action

Outline chemical signalling in the body
?
Cells can communicate by the release of molecules
- Neurotransmitters (wired networks)
- Hormones (broadcast)
- local mediators (shouting)
Membrane-bound moelcules
Immune system (cellular contact)
Multiples sites of drug action

Outline how molecular targets bind drugs
?
Molecules involved in mediating physiological effects Receptors, Ion channels, Carriers, Enzymes
Signalling cells: specific enzymes, carriers, and ion channels will be involved in the synthesis, storage, and possibly, inactivation process, **Regulating concentration**
Target cell: Specific receptors recognise the signalling molecule, transduction, amplification of signal by enzymes, carriers, and ion channels, **Regulate response**

Outline the predictability of drug response and releavance::Too predictable means not relevant, but too relevant means effects are unpredictable

What does pharmacokinetics mean::Effect of the body on the drug

What does pharmacodynamics mean::Effect of the drug no the body

Outline how receptors function
?
Initiate cellular signalling by chemical mediators
Make drugs powerful and potent
- Amplification through 2nd messenger
- Signalling may invovle ion channels, enzymes, carriers
Contribute to specific responses based on drug selectivity
Targetted by 40-60% of therapeutic dugs
Principles applicable to other targets
- Ion channels, enzymes, carriers

What is an agonist::Actives and bind receptor

What is an antagonist::Bind and DO NOT activate the receptor

What are the measurable properties of receptor drugs
?
Affinity: Attraction to target
Efficacy: Amount required to have an effect
Potency: Only agonists elicit a cellular/tissue response
Agonists are used to mimic endogenous signalling molecules (intrinsic)
Antagonists are used to inhibit endogenous signalling molecules (Clinical)

Outline affinity
?
A quantifiable measure of the molecular attraction of a drug (agonist or antagonist) to the receptor
Law of mass action: Receptor + Drugs = Drug-receptor complex
Dissociation constants Kd
- Concentration at which 50% of receptors are bound
- ** Low Kd means high affinity**
Drugs have an affinity for different receptors
- Constant for a given drug-receptor pair
- Relative affinity gives an indication of the **selectivity** of the drug

Outline desipramine
?
Desipramine is considered a selective noradrenaline uptake inhibitor
- Binds other targets with lower affinity (30-fold increase required)
The dose (concentration) determines the effect

Describe the concentration-response curve
?
Emax - a measure of the **efficacy** of a drug (**How much effect**)
EC50 - a measure of the **potency** of a drug (**How much drug**)
The antagonist is unable to elicit a response in vitro

Outline antagonist response at the non-tissue level
?
The effect only observed when the agonist is acting at receptors
Prevent receptors activation by endogenous chemicals when a system is active
- Atropine blocks acetylcholine receptors
- Propranolol blocks noradrenaline receptors
Active in vivo
- Dose-response can be elicited
- Measurable potency and efficacy
- important therapeutic drugs with clinical efficacy and potency

Outline potency of drugs (EC50)
How much drug is needed for the effect
- NOT the affinity
- NOT the size of the response
- If the curve is left shifted it is more powerful

How do we determine the antagonist
?
2 drugs acting at 1 receptor
Assume mass action, reversible binding to the receptor
At equilibrium
- The effect of the antagonist is to decrease the apparent potency of the agonist
- The relative shift in the agonist concentration-response curve is a measure of antagonist potency (pA2 or pKb)
- Surmountable/competitive
- No change in the agonist maximum
- Parallel shift in the concentration-response curve

Outline the efficacy of a drug
?
How much of an effect the drug can elicit
The ability of a drug to activate the receptor
Different maximal responses for drugs acting at the same receptor (full and partial agonist)

Outline how all drugs have more than one action
?
Drugs elicit responses in the body by interacting with molecular targets for endogenous molecules
- Agonists mimic the endogenous muscle
- Antagonists block the endogenous muscle
- The bigger response isn't always better
- Optimize the benefit (clinical efficacy) and minimise the risk (clinical toxicity)

Outline pharmacokinetics
?
Intravenous -> directly into the plasma
Absorption -> Plasma -> Metabolise -> Excreted
Distribution available in Target, elsewhere
Bioavailability reaches the plasma
First-pass metabolism (how much metabolism occurs before the drug reaches the target)
Plasma protein binding (less likely to bound if already bound)
Affects how much but not how often

Outline the equation for pharmacokinetics
?
Dose -> absorption -> Kabs -> Single well-stirred compartment where plasma concentration is proportional to response
Single well-stirred compartment -> Kelim -> Elimination
The volume of distribution size of the compartment
Clearance (CI) is how fast it is eliminated, given at this rate to maintain a steady state dose
Half-life is how long it takes the time to reduce by half

Pharmacodynamics is where and how much
Pharmacokinetics, how much, how often, how given

Outline safe principles of drug action
?
Recognise the appropriate molecular drug targets
Anticipate cellular / tissue / system / body effects
Evaluate benefit vs risk
Quantifying drug activity
