# C2S - L20 - Innate Immune System

## Intended Learning Outcomes
- Describe the role of the innate immune system
- Describe the different types of innate cells found in blood and tissues
- Explain how cells of the innate immune system are able to recognise and eliminate pathogens

## Innate Immunity
What are the three levels of defence?
?
Physical barriers - skin, gastric acid, mucous-lined epithelial surfaces
Innate immune system
Adaptive immune system

What is the difference between innate and adaptive immunity
?
Non-specific response in innate immunity
The adaptive immune response is specific

Describe the cells in both the innate and adaptive immune response
?
Innate: basophils, eosinophils, neutrophils, mast cells, natural killer cells
Both: Macrophage, and dendritic cells
Adaptive: B cells and T cells

T/F adaptive immunity responds first::False, innate responded first

Describe the innate immune system
?
Non-specific: Recognises molecules not typically found on vertebrate cells as "foreign" and can also recognise molecules from damaged cells
Rapid: often constituents of innate immunity are performed and can be released within minutes by stimulated cells to initiate inflammation 
No immunologic memory: Response is the same no matter what the invader
Communicates to the adaptive immune system

What are the components of the innate immune system
?
Granulocytes: contain large preformed granules involved in inflammation
Phagocytic cells: process and present antigen fragments on the cell surface
Natural killer cells: seek and destroy tumours and virus-infected cells
Complement: proteins that enhance immune responses
Cytokines: protein messages provide signals to immune cells

Outline how pathogen identification works in innate immunity
?
Receptors for carbohydrates (e.g. mannose) NOT found in vertebrate cells identify these as pathogens for macrophages to ingest
Receptors for antibodies and complement for neutrophils and macrophages
Pathogens then engulfed and exposed to a variety of toxic metabolites
Phagocytosis -> Phagosome + lysosome -> Phagolysosome -> Breakdown -> Exocytosis

What are toll-like receptors
?
Found on many cells of the innate immune system
Pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)
Damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs)

What are NOD like receptors
?
Found on inside of cell
Recognise peptidoglycan

What cells of the innate immune system are phagocytic
?
Macrophages
Neutrophils
Eosinophils

What cells of the innate immune system secrete inflammatory mediators
?
Basophils
Mast cells
platelets

What cells secrete interferons and cytokines::All other cells

What are the granulocytes (Polymorphonuclear cells)
?
Neutrophils: Clear granules
Eosinophils: Eosinophilic granules
Basophils: Basophilic granules
Heterophils: Neutrophils for non-mammalian species (rabbits)
Azurophils: Found in reptiles

Outline neutrophils
?
Predominant circulating phagocytic cell
granules contain proteolytic enzymes such as myeloperoxidase (critical for oxygen-free radical production)
elastase, proteinase 3, cathepsin G and metalloproteinases
All can be damaging to normal tissue
Can release a net to trap pathogens to then be able to phagocytose them

Outline eosinophils
?
Eosinophils are much less common and normally only circulate in small numbers (<3% of WCC)
Granules contain enzymes (acid hydrolases, peroxidase) cytotoxic proteins and cytokine mediators
Eosinophils are important when the body is invaded by parasites and during allergy attacks. Granules are released to respond to the parasite and allergens
Eosinophil granules react with products from basophils, mast cells, and lymphocytes eg. Eosinophil granules contain histaminase which inactivates histamine
Typically the nucleus is bi-lobed, not multi-lobed as in the neutrophils
Considerable species variation in morphology

Outline basophils
?
Normally only present in small numbers in blood (approximately 05% of the total leukocytes)
Absent in cats, rats and mice
Basophil granules contain heparin and vasoactive compounds such as histamine
Basophils participate in modulating inflammatory reactions
Involved in immediate hypersensitivities, allergic reactions to bee string

Outline monocytes
?
Large (16-25um) circulating phagocytic white blood cell, having a single well-defined nucleus and very fine granulation in the cytoplasm
Monocytes constitute usually less than 10% of the circulation leukocytes in dogs, cats and horses
The nucleus varies in form and may be kidney-shaped, bean-shaped, or horseshoe-shaped with a deep indentation

Outline macrophages
?
Monocytes: circulate in the blood
Monocytes exit the blood and mature into macrophages
Macrophages are phagocytic cells that process and present antigens to cells of the adaptive immune system
Macrophages are antigen-presenting cells (APCs)
APCs are found in the skin (called Langhan's cells), lymph nodes, spleen, mucosal epithelia and thymus

What two cells are professional antigen-presenting cells and how long do they last
?
Macrophages and dendritic cells
macrophages and dendritic cells last for long times in tissues and can sequestrate resistant pathogens

Outline dendritic cells
?
A network of dendritic cells (DC) forms a front-line defence on mucosal surfaces
DC recognise, process and presents antigen on their cell surface to initiate T-cell responses
DC can migrate from mucosal surfaces/tissues and traffic to the nearby (draining) lymph nodes where they interact with T cells
DC are professional antigen-presenting cells

Outline natural killer cells
?
NK cells have cell surface receptors that can recognise foreign cells (tumours and altered cells infected with the virus)
Activated NK cells respond with non-specific cytotoxic functions
Normal cells of the body are protected from cytotoxicity mediated by NK cells
NK cell reaction is mediated by MHC 1 receptor molecule. Lack of this receptor will cause the NK cell to destroy the target cell
Destruction is performed by perforins and granzymes

What are the two types of chemical signalling that occur between the innate and adaptive immune system
?
Lipid derived - released: Prostaglandins, leukotrienes, eicosanoids
Protein derived - secreted: Cytokines

Describe the derivation of lipid signalling hormones between the innate and adaptive immune system
?
Prostaglandins, Leukotrienes, Eicosanoids
Lipid mediators of inflammation and immune regulation derived from arachidonic acid (a normal membrane omega-6 fatty acid)
Released by injured cells
They can also serve as a secondary messenger in some events triggered by cytokines

What are cytokines
?
Very small proteins that work as a messenger between cells
Involved in innate and adaptive immune responses
Typically work over short distances (autocrine or paracrine)
Some have endocrine effects
Make up a signalling network that controls the immune response
Many different cytokines are produced by many cell types
Single cytokine can act on many different cell types (pleiotropy)
Many cytokines have the same jobs/functions (redundancy/synergy)
Some cytokines antagonise the effects of others, Most are pro-inflammatory, and some are anti-inflammatory
Secretion usually transient
Extremely potent

What are the 6 different types of cytokines
1. Tumour necrosis factors
2. Interleukins
3. Chemokines
4. Colony-stimulating factors
5. Transforming growth factors
6. Interferons

What are the 3 main cytokines involved in inflammatory response?
?
1. Tumour necrosis factors
2. interleukins
3. Chemokines

What are interferons
?
Communicate about the presence of infected cells
IFN $\alpha\beta$ prevents other cells from becoming infected

What are the 3 roles of the complement system
?
Lysis of bacteria: Final stage of the complement cascade which forms the membrane attack complex which will puncture a hole in the cell wall of the bacteria. Can also attract neutrophils
Phagocytosis of bacteria (chemotaxis)
Opsonisation: coat to make it easier for phagocytosis

Describe how a neutrophil enters the cell
?
1. Activating substances released by bacteria and damaged tissues
2. Neutrophil begins rolling until it sheds L selectin
3. The integrin will bind to E selecting
4. Leads to adhesions
5. Diapedesis across the blood vessel wall
6. C3A, C5A, chemokines, histamine, prostaglandins, and leukotrienes help guide the neutrophil
7. The neutrophil phagocytosis destroys C3b-coated bacteria

Describe the process of phagocytosis
?
Polymorphs
Macrophages: 
1. Adherence to microbe
2. Engulfment
3. Phagosome formation
4. Fusion with lysosome
5. Phagolysosome
6. Destruction of microbe

What happens when the body is breached
?
When the physical integrity of the body is breached and foreign objects (especially bacteria) manage to enter, neutrophils aggregate at the site in enormous numbers by chemotactic factors released from the damaged tissue

What effects can cytokines have
?
Fever, inappertance, feeling unwell
