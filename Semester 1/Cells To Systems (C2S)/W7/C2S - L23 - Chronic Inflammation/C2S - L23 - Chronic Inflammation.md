## Chronic Inflammation

What causes chronic inflammation
?
When acute inflammation fails to resolve a result:
- Foreign bodies (nail in finger, grass horns)
- Autoimmune disease (rheumatoid arthritis)
- Persistent infection (tuberculosis)
- Hypersensitivity/Allergic disease

What is the time frame (duration) of acute vs chronic inflammation?
?
Peracute (immediate): minimal inflammation
Acute (<2 days) - acute inflammation
Subacute (2-7 days) - the transitional period
Chronic (7 days +) - chronic inflammation

What are the features of chronic inflammation
?
1. Changes in inflammatory cell population
  1. Lymphocyte
  2. Plasma cell
  3. Macrophage
  4. Eosinophils
  5. Neutrophils
2. Inflammatory tissue damage
3. Tissue healing: Regeneration, fibrosis, and scar tissue formation

Outline the change in cell type in chronic inflammation
?
Represents induction of the ADAPTIVE immune response
T lymphocytes
- Key cells of the adaptive immune system
- Activated in response to specific binding of antigen with T-cell receptor
  - Proliferation of lymphocytes
  - Produce cytokines to direct the immune response
- No antigen recognition = minimal chronic inflammation

Provide a simplified view of the adaptive immune response
?
Antigen presentation to T cells
Th1 recruits macrophages and produces IgG antibody
Th2 recruits eosinophils and produces IgE antibody
Cytotoxic NK T cell

What are the subtypes of chronic inflammation
?
Lymphocytic/Lymphoplasmacytic (lymphocytes and plasma cells)
Granulomatous (granulocytes)
Eosinophilic (eosinophils)
Often mixed and may have neutrophil (chronic-active inflammation)

Outline lymphocytic inflammation
?
Also called non-suppurative inflammation
A mix of lymphocytes:
- Cytotoxic T cells
- Helper T cells (Th cells)
- B cells
Plasma cells may be present (Lymphoplasmacytic inflammation)
Perivascular distribution common
Sometimes form nodular aggregates (Lymphoid follicles, B cells surrounded by T cells, the centre is called genulocenters)

What are the causes of lymphocytic inflammation?
?
Commonly respond to cell-associated antigens
Auto-immune disease
- Type 1 diabetes
Viral infections
- Rabies
- Viral hepatitis in humans
Hypersensitivity diseases
- Inflammatory bowel disease
Idiopathic (we don't know how it works)
- Lymphoplasmacytic stomatitis

Outline the role of macrophages in chronic inflammation
?
Phagocytosis
- Digest and eliminate foreign agents
- Present antigen to T cells (function as an antigen-presenting cell)
Direct inflammation and repair
- Secrete cytokines such as interleukin 12 (IL-12) to promote inflammation
- Secrete cytokines such as TGF-B to suppress inflammation and promote repair

What do macrophages respond to in chronic inflammation?
?
Chronic infections (parasites, fungi, mycobacteria)
Foreign material

What is the name called macrophage-dominated inflammation?
Granulomatous inflammation
Also called histiocytic (histiocyte is another word for macrophage) inflammation
Macrophages form clusters called granulomas (cells may fuse to form giant cells)

What are the subtypes of granulomatous inflammation?
?
Pyogranuloma: central accumulation of neutrophils
- Seen with some foreign bodies, particularly with bacterial contamination
- Also with some infections (Rhodococcus equi)
- Neutrophils in centre
- Macrophage on outside
Caseating granuloma/necrogranuloma
- The cheesy centre is composed of dead tissue
- Seen particularly with tuberculosis and some parasites
- Central dead (necrotic cell debris)
- Giant cells on the outside

Outline granulomatous inflammation
?
Often discrete or coalescing nodules in tissues
Easy to mistake for neoplasia
BUT
- Nodules don't develop in all granulomatous disease
- Johne's disease: Diffuse (no nodular) granulomatous enteritis

Outline eosinophilic inflammation
?
Primarily parasitic or allergic disease
Affected tissues often have a green appearance (eosinophils are actually green)

Describe the tissue destruction in chronic inflammation
?
Tissue damage results from:
- Damage by the original insult (Bacteria)
- Release of inflammatory mediators (Free radicals, complement, proteases)
- Cellular phagocytosis or apoptosis (Macrophage, T cells)
- Tissue death by circulatory compromise (thrombosis)

Outline healing in chronic inflammation
?
Attempted regardless of whether insult resolved
Usually ineffective without resolution of insult
A lumpy jaw is when bone tries to regrow while the infection is not resolved

Outline the general process of healing
?
Two major pathways
- Regeneration
- Repair
This applies to healing following inflammation and physical injury (wounds)
Some tissue (eg. bone) have specialized healing mechanisms

Outline the regeneration pathway
?
Replacement of damaged tissue with the original cell type
Dependent on:
- Viability of original cells
- Type of tissue
- Preservation of connective tissue scaffold
- Need some cells to remain, if all cells are wiped out you cannot regenerate

What are the cell regeneration types?
?
Labile cells
- Undergo constant turnover and can regenerate completely from germinal cells
- Epidermis of skin, intestinal epithelium, bone marrow
Stable cells
- Normally quiescent (not diving), but have the ability to regenerate if required
- Hepatocytes, osteocytes, renal tubular epithelium
Permanent cells
- Considered terminally differentiated
- Do not regenerate
- Neurons, cardiac muscle

Outline the process of tissue repair
?
Replacement of damaged tissue by fibrous connective tissue (scar tissue)
- Also referred to as fibrosis
Restores structure at expense of function
Occurs in competition with regeneration
An example is liver cirrhosis
Heart areas with necrosis replaced by fibrous tissue (white)

How does tissue repair occur
?
The defect is initially filled by the formation of granulation tissue
- Fragile, vascular tissue
- Completely different from granuloma


## Inflammatory Phase

What is the inflammatory phase of tissue repair?
?
Clearance of damaged tissue debris (neutrophils and macrophages)
Can be maggots
Replaced by fibrin coagulum

What is the proliferative phase of tissue repair
?
Production of granulation tissue
Angiogenesis
- Provides oxygen and nutrients for healing
- Hypoxia in damaged tissue stimulates the release of growth factors (VEGF, FGFs, Angiopoietins) to promote blood vessel development
Fibroplasia
- Production of collagen stroma
- Migration of fibroblasts and deposition of immature type 3 collagen
- Occurs under influence of growth factors (PDGF, FGFs, TGF-B)

Outline the maturation and scar formation
?
Reorganization of collage and change in collagen type (Type 1)
- Type 1 collagen stronger
- Organised parallel with lines of tension
Contraction of connective tissue
Maturation and regression of vasculature
More mature will have fewer blood vessels
More collagen deposits in more repaired tissue

What is scat tissue::Organized, poorly vascular fibrous connective tissue composed of dense collagen (pink-red)

Outline primary intention healing
?
Closing the wound means that there is quick platelet plug formation
Wound edges joined by fibrin plug (24 hours)
Regrowth of basal layer of the epidermis (days)
Lysis of fibrin and re-epithelialisation (1 week)
Restoration to intact skin (weeks)

Outline secondary intention healing 
?
Unclosed wound
Large defect filled by fibrin clot (2-3 days)
New blood vessels and fibroblasts (granulation tissue) grow from the dermis into fibrin (1-2 weeks)
Collagen laid down by granulation tissue fibroblasts to restore integrity (2-4 weeks)
Maturation of collagen achieves structural integrity and allows regrowth of the epidermis

What are the differences between primary and secondary intention healing
?
The primary is closing the wound
Secondary is leaving the wound open
Secondary:
- More inflammation
- More granulation tissue
- More fibrosis/scarring
- PROLONGED HEALING

What factors influence healing
?
Infection
Foreign material
Nutrition
Vascular/Oxygen supply
Movement pressure
Hormones (Corticoids steroids take a long)
Concurrent disease
Age

Outline proud flesh in horses
?
Excessive formation of granulation tissue that delays healing
Common in horses
Trim back down to the normal vessel

Outline keloid formation
?
Formation of excessive scar tissue during healing
Rare in animals, people of African descent predisposed


What are the consequences of scarring
?
Strictures: Scar contracture causing narrowing of hollowing organs
Adhesions: Formation of fibrous tissue attachments between adjacent organs
Restricted movement: Contraction of scar tissue around joints and tendons can prevent normal movement
