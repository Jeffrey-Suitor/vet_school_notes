## Inflammation

What is inflammation::The body's response to infection, irritation or injury?

What is an acute inflammation?
?
**Rapid** response to injury: Onset in seconds to minutes
**Non-specific response**: Innate immune mechanisms
Functions:
- **Delivery** of biological mediators and leukocytes to the site of inflammation
- **Destruction** of pathogens
- **Breakdown and removal** of damaged tissue and debris

What are the causes of inflammation
?
Physical injury: Trauma, tissue death, thermal, electrical, radiation or chemical injury
Foreign material
Infection: Viral, bacterial, protozoal, and fungal infections
Immunological reaction (hypersensitivity): Abnormal reaction to environmental substances (allergy)
Abnormal reaction to own tissues (autoimmune)

T/F dead tissue can experience inflammation::False

What is the process of tissue healing after necrosis::Nearby tissue granulates and replaces the necrotised tissue

What are the cardinal signs of inflammation
?
1. Rubor (Redness): Vessel dilation and increased blood flow
2. Calor (Heat): Vessel dilation and increased blood flow
3. Tumor (Swelling): Accumulation of oedema/exudate fluid
4. Dolor (Pain): Chemical mediators, pressure on nerve ending
5. Functio Laesa: (Loss of function)

What are the inflammatory mediators?
?
Autacoids (fast, short-acting, hormone-like factors): Histamine, Bradykinin, Substance P IMMEDIATE
Eicosanoids (arachidonic acid metabolites): Prostaglandins, Leukotrienes LATER
Cytokines (cell-signalling molecules): Tumour-necrosis factor (TNF), Interleukin 1 (IL-1) LATEST

Describe the Autacoids
?
Fast, short-acting inflammatory mediators
Histamine
- Produced by mast cells/basophils
- Wide range of stimuli for release:
  - IgE antibodies
  - Heat/cold
  - Trauma
  - Cytokines
  - Bacterial molecules
  - Nerve signalling
Bradykinin
- Released during blood clotting (coagulation cascade)
Substance P
- Neurotransmitters released from nerve terminals
- Stimulated by a range of stress signals, including histamine
All-cause:
- Vasodilation (reddening/hyperaemia)
- Increased vascular permeability (swelling/oedema)
- Pain/itching
- Hives
Other effects
- Histamine and bradykinin cause bronchocontristicion
- histamine causes increased mucus secretion
- Substance P activates leukocytes

Describe the Eicosanoids
?
Metabolites of arachidonic acid from the cell membrane
Synthesised on demand, slower action
Two major types:
- Prostaglandins (PG)
- Leukotrienes

Describe Prostaglandins
?
Synthesised from arachidonic acid by cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2)
Inflammatory prostaglandins (PGD2, PGE2)
- Produced by mast cells and tissues
- Cause vasodilation and increased vascular permeability
- Prostaglandin E2 also causes pain and fever
Coagulation mediators
- Prostacyclin (PGI2): Vasodilation and inhibit coagulation PROSTACYCLINS
- Thromboxane A2 (TxA2): Vasoconstriction and promotion coagulation 

Cyclooxygenase 1 regulates many important physiological effects including renal and gastrointestinal homeostasis

T/F If you have a drug that inhibits COX2 aside from impacting the inflammatory response you will also see issues in the GI and Kidneys::True, can be gastric intestinal ulcers

Describe Leukotrienes
?
Synthesised from arachidonic acid by lipoxygenase (LOX)
Leukotriene B4
- Produced by neutrophils
- Attracts and activates neutrophils
Leukotrienes C4, D4, E4
- Produced by mast cells and eosinophils
- Increase vascular permeability
- Cause vasoconstriction
- Cause bronchoconstriction

Where are the main points at which the eicosanoid signalling pathway can be targeted
?
Phospholipase A2 by Corticosteroids
Aspirin/Non-steroidal anti-inflammatories targeting COX2
Lipooxygenase inhibitors target LOX

What are acute-phase cytokines
?
Mediators of inflammation secreted by leukocytes
- Tumour necrosis (TNF)
- Interleukin 1 (IL-1)
Actions
- Increase vascular permeability
- Promote leukocyte release and activation
- Promote leukocyte extravasation (exit from vessels)
- increase production of other inflammatory mediators (autacoids, eicosanoids)
- Induce fever
- Promote coagulation

## Acute Inflammatory Response

What are the key components of the Acute inflammatory response?
?
Vasodilation
Increased vascular permeability
Emigration of leukocytes (mostly neutrophils)

What is the purpose of the acute inflammatory response
?
To allow leukocytes and inflammatory mediators to localise at the site of inflammation 

Explain the process of step 1 of the acute inflammatory response (vasodilation)
?
Mediated by:
- Autacoids (histamine/bradykinin)
- Prostaglandins (PGD2, PGE2, PGI2)
- Nitric Oxide
Effect:
- Perfuses tissue with inflammatory mediators and leukocytes
- Slows blood flow to allow leukocyte margination
- More blood flow (arteriole dilation, expansion of capillary bed, venule dilation)

Outline the appearance of vasodilation
?
Localised
- Engorged vessels
- Reddening of tissues (rubor)
- Blood flow to tissue increases temperature (calor)
Systemic (sepsis)
- Generalised tissue congestion
- Anaphylaxis and shock
  - Decreased blood pressure
  - Poor tissue perfusion
  - Can lead to death
To much vasodilation can cause a drop in blood pressure which can lead to poor tissue profusion and eventually death

Outline the second step of acute inflammation, increased vascular permeability
?
Leaking due to disruption of endothelial barrier
- Allows release of plasma proteins and leukocytes from blood vessels
Mechanisms
- Endothelial cell retraction
  - Increased intracellular gaps mostly in venules
  - Immediate response due to histamine
  - Delayed (approximately 2-8 hours) due to eicosanoids, bradykinin, complement and cytokines
- Endothelial injury
  - The damage leads to prolonged leakage until repair
  - Can result from initial injury or damage by leukocytes

Outline the third step of the acute inflammation response, the emigration of leukocytes
?
1. Endothelial activation
  1. The expression of adhesion molecules (selectins, integrins)
  2. Induced by cytokines (TNF, IL-1), tissue damage
2. Leukocyte rolling
  1. Allows loose attachment of leukocytes via selectins
  2. Gradual slowing of leukocyte
3. Adhesion
  1. Firm attachment via integrins
4. Transmigration
  1. Migration (chemotaxis) between endothelial cells into the interstitium
  2. Attracted by chemical signals (chemokines)

Outline the effects of increased vascular permeability
?
Fluid leakage into tissues --> Oedema
- Fluid accumulation in tissue
- The tissue becomes swollen and gelatinous (tumour)
- can be due to inflammatory or non-inflammatory causes (lymphoedema)
- Usually, also leukocytes when inflammatory
Fluid leakage into body cavities --> Effusion
- Transudate
  - Mild increase in permeability
  - Leakage of fluid +/- protein
  - Low-moderate protein, few cells present
  - Mild inflammation or can be non-inflammatory (heart failure)
- Exudate (pus)
  - A large increase in permeability
  - Leakage of fluid and protein with cell migration
  - high protein, many cells
  - typically inflammatory

What is in exudate
?
Fluid
- Water containing a mixture of salts to dilute toxins and pathogens
- Drains via lymphatics and lymph nodes for immune surveillance
Plasma proteins
- Inflammatory mediators and antimicrobial molecules
- Antibodies
- Clotting factors
- Fibrin
  - Formed from circulating precursor protein, fibrinogen
  - Polymerises via blood coagulation cascade
  - Forms clot composed of filamentous, insoluble protein (fibrinogen --> fibrin)
  - Meshwork blocks the migration of bacteria and aids the migration of leukocytes
Leukocytes
- Neutrophils
  - First-line immune defence
  - Phagocytose and degraded foreign material
  - Produce enzymes, free radicals, cytokines and other inflammatory mediators
- Other leukocytes
  - Sometimes macrophages and lymphocytes (chronic changes)

## Pathological Classification of Acute Inflammation

What is serous acute inflammation?
?
At least severe, mild inflammation
Only water and low MW solutes pass out of plasma
Formation of transudate

What is catarrhal inflammation
?
Exudate formed on mucosal surfaces
Hypersecretion of mucous intermixed with serous fluid plus cell debris and inflammatory cells
Green, slimy mucous,

What is fibrinous acute inflammation
?
Leakage of fibrin from vessels
Fibrinogen converted to fibrin
The yellow gel gradually becomes more solid over time
Typically coats serosal or mucosal surfaces
Ground glass (mild) or bread and butter appearance

What is suppurative inflammation
?
Purulent exudate (pus)
Contains
- Large numbers of neutrophils
- Dead cell debris

What is an abscess
?
A localised collection of pups caused by suppurative inflammation
Response to pyogenic bacteria
Confined by a wall of fibrous tissue when chronic

What is empyema 
?
Accumulation of pus within a body cavity
Pyothorax occurs in the thorax
Guttural pouch empyema occurs in the guttural pouch

Explain the role of pain in acute inflammation
?
One of the cardinal signs of inflammation (dolour)
Specific nerves signal pain (Nociceptors)
Local stimulation
- Damage/injury to peripheral nerve endings
- Effect of inflammatory mediators on nerve endings
- Pressure on nerve endings from tissue swelling
Heightened pain sensitivity in inflammation
- Hypersensitivity of nerve endings
- Amplification of pain pathways in the spinal cord
- Caused by mediators such as prostaglandin E2, IL-1
Neurogenic inflammation
- Inflammatory mediators such as substance P released from nerve endings

Describe the role of itching in acute inflammation
?
Different nerve fibres to pain (Puriceptors)
The itch may accompany local skin inflammation
Caused by
- Inflammatory mediators activating nerve endings
  - Histamine, serotonin, prostaglandins
- Substance P releases histamine from mast cells
Scratching leads to self-trauma and more inflammation
Often times we use E collars to prevent animals from causing more damage to themselves

Describe the role of fever in acute inflammation
?
Fever (pyrexia; febrile response)
Purpose
- Increases motility of leukocytes, phagocytosis
- Increase proliferation of T cells
- Impairs growth of temperature-sensitive pathogens
Mechanism
- Induced by pyrogens
  - Endogenous: cytokines, such as IL-1, TNF
  - Exogenous: bacterial toxin, lipopolysaccharide (endotoxin)
- Pyrogen causes a release of PGE2
- PGE2 acts on the hypothalamus in the brain
  - Increases physiological thermostat
  - Results in systemic responses to increasing the temperature
    - Shivering
    - Peripheral vasoconstriction

Outline the process of inflammation resolution
?
The reduced stimulus for leukocyte migration
Apoptosis of neutrophils in tissue
Lipoxins
- Alternative arachidonic acid metabolism
- Stop signal to suppress the neutrophil activity
Anti-inflammatory cytokines
- IL-10 from regulatory T cells (inactivates macrophages)
- TGF-B from anti-inflammatory macrophages

What are the outcomes of acute inflammation
?
Resolution (ideal outcome)
- Insult is resolved without significant tissue damage, or damaged area is replaced by tissue with normal structure and function
Fibrous repair (scar tissue)
- Tissue architecture destroyed; original cell types cannot re-grow
- Usually response to substantial tissue damage (non-specialised)
Chronic inflammation
- Damaging agents and tissue destruction persists
- Ongoing attempts to heal by fibrous repair
- Ongoing immune responses.

What is endotoxaemia (sepsis)
?
