# C2S - L21 - Adaptive Immunity

## Intended Learning Outcomes
- Describe the role of the adaptive immune system
- Describe how B lymphocytes and T lymphocytes both recognise and respond to pathogens
- Explain how the adaptive and innate immune systems work in conjunction to eliminate infections

## Adaptive Immunity
What are the 3 types of host resistance to microbial infection?
?
1. Physical barriers
  1. Skin barrier and mucous membranes
  2. Normal bacterial flora
2. Innate: non-specific immunity
  1. Circulating messengers (complement, cytokines, etc)
  2. Phagyocytes and inflammation
3. Adaptive: specific immunity
  1. Target specific defence against microbial antigens

What are the types of antigen-presenting 
?
Dendritic cells (phagocytose and present to T cells)
Macrophages (phagocytose and present to T cells)
B cells

What is the concept of self and non-self
?
The innate system relies on a broad defence against non-self invaders
BUT - it is energetically expensive and the innate system can be easily avoided by clever rapidly evolving pathogens
- Protective surfaces e.g. capsules made of slime
- Chemical mimicry pretending to be the host
- Ability to survive intracellularly

What are the 3 types of white blood cells?
?
Polymorphonuclear cells: involved in inflammation
- Non-discriminating self-destructing suicide missions
- release damaging enzymes that destroy invaders
APCs, macrophages and dendritic cells
- Phagocytose, process and present Ag to T cells
Lymphocytes
- T cells: killer/helpers (T cell receptors on cell surface interact with antigen presented on another cell surface)
- B cells: produce a soluble antibody that interacts with an antigen
- NK cells, seek and destroy tumour cells and virus-infected cells via receptor recognition

What are the features of the adaptive immune response?
?
Adaptability: Recognition of novel antigens, and emerging viruses have never been seen before
Specificity: Recognition of self versus no-self not just to avoid autoimmune disease
Diversity: the capacity to produce a large array of antibodies and T cell receptors - gene recombination
Memory: Secondary response to re-exposure (principles of vaccination)

Outline what an antigen is
?
A molecule that can be recognised by receptors on immune cells
Small chemical structures to highly complex molecules
Recognition is usually small part of antigen = epitope
Not all antigens are immunogenic (Haptens aka drugs, and carbohydrates)

Provide an overview of the adaptive immune response
?
Adaptive immune responses are Ag specific and involved B and T cells
- Recognises specific Ag through cell surface receptors and need to be activated before they function as effector cells
- Need to be able to tell the difference between self and non-self
T cells
- T helper cells ($T_H$) orchestrate the response with cytokines
- T cytotoxic cells ($T_C$) kill pathogen-infected cells or cancer cells
- Cell-mediated immunity
B cells produce antibodies (Ag-specific)
- Humoral immunity

Describe the lymphocyte development
?
T cell precursors come from the bone marrow and develop in the Thymus
T cells only develop in the thymus; nowhere else in the body.
B cell precursors from the bone marrow develop in the Bursa of Fabricius (birds) and the Bone marrow in mammals

What is the MHC
?
Major histocompatibility complex
The structure used by cells to present antigens
Two classes: MHC-1 and MHC-2
All nucleated cells express MHC-1
Antigen-presenting cells express MHC-2 as well
MHC is specific to self

What are the 3 types of lymphocytes
?
Cytotoxic T cells (CD8): Kill virus-infected and damaged cells
Helper T cells (CD4): Help cytotoxic T cells and B cells in their function
B cells: Produce antibodies

Outline T cell receptors
?
T cells only recognise peptide antigens when presented by MHC
T cell receptors bing antigen mpresented by MHC
Made of glycoprotein chains
- $\alpha/\beta$ in most species and $\gamma/\delta$ in ruminants
- Form a complex with CD3
Additional proteins can be found in close association with TCRs
- CD4 proteins are found on helper T cells
- CD8 proteins are found on cytotoxic T cells
CD4 binds MHC 2
CD8 binds MHC 1

Outline $\gamma/\delta$ T cell receptors
?
Most $\gamma/\delta$ T cell receptors don't recognise MHC antigen complexes (Most don't have CD4 or CD8)
Activation of $\gamma/\delta$ T cell results in production of cytokines, lysis of infected cells, interaction with other cells

Outline the T cell receptor (TCR)
?
Highly variable protein that recognises specific Ag presented to them
TCR is anchored into the cell by a conserved transmembrane domain complexed to the CD3 protein
CD3 is required for cell surface expression of TCR and is involved in signal transduction
TCR:CD3 complex is present on all T-cells
TCR binding site is different for each Ag
APCs seek out a TCR that matches

CD4 or CD8 is also required to recognise the type of cell that is presenting Ag, why?
?
To make sure that either CD4 or CD8 gets the appropriate MHC 1 or 2 signal

Explain T cell development in the thymus
?
Translocate from the bone marrow into the thymus
Being as CD4 and CD8 negative
They grow and become CD4 and CD8 positive
There is a positive selection for T cells that can bind MHC (95% of T cells failed and undergo apoptosis)
Negative selection for T cells that recognise self-MHC antigen as foreign
During this process, one of the receptor types is lost leaving only CD4 or CD8 receptors remaining on the T cell which determines its role

At the end of the process describe the type of $\alpha/\beta$ T cells that remain
?
DON'T recognise your own MHC with no antigen bound
- This is considered self
DO recognise self MHC + bound antigen
- "Altered self"
- Occasionally non-peptide antigens can alter self-MHC and elicit a T-cell response
DO recognise foreign MHC

Describe the process of antigen presentation
?
Activated dendritic cells migrate to the local draining lymph node
Process antigen
Present antigen to T cells
- MHC molecules
- Costimulatory molecules (B7 on APC and CD28 on T cell)
- Cytokine signalling allows for signalling between the two cells and is the final step in activating the T cell

What do CD8 T cells do when activated
?
1. Cytotoxic T cell binds to infected T cells
2. Perforin makes holes in the infected cell's membrane and enzyme enters
3. Infected cell destroyed

What are the two types of helper T cells?
?
T helper 1 which helps cytotoxic T cells, and natural killer cells
T helper 2 which helps B cells (B-memory cells and plasma cells)

Describe the principle cytokines of T helper response
?
IL-2: B cell proliferation and differentiation
IL-4: IgE production
IL-5 IgA production (T helper cell 2)
IL-6: plasma cell differentiation
IL-10: downregulates Th1 cytokines 
= antibody production
IFN$\gamma$: 
- macrophages, NK cells (T helper 1)
- downregulates Th2 activation
= Cytotoxic T cells and cell-mediated immunity

Outline B cell surface receptors
?
Surface receptors and soluble receptors (=antibodies)
Act as APCs
- Antigen binds to B cell receptor
- Internalised, processed, and expressed on MHC-2
- BCRs are specific for one particular type of antigen
Helper T cells co-stimulate B cells
The clonal expansion causes them to either become memory cells to fight future infections or plasma cells that start producing large amounts of antibodies

What is a clonal proliferation
?
Plasma cells (produce LOTS of antibodies)
Memory B cells

What is an antibody
?
5 classes of antibodies (immunoglobulins)
- IgG
- IgA
- IgM
- IgE
- IgD
All are based on a Y-shaped molecule that matches a specific antigen
Secreted into body fluids, can also bind to surface receptors on certain cells to facilitate antigen recognition and/or presentation

What is the valence of IgM::10

What is the first immunoglobulin to begin circulating::IgM because it can bind to so many different antigens due to its valence of 10? It does not bind that antigen well.

What is class switching?
?
After the B cell has successfully bound IgM it will switch and start producing IgG most commonly IgE or IgA.

Explain why memory is beneficial in B cells
?
It means the second time an antigen is encountered not only does the response occur in a shorter time but also the response is more specific and larger and lasts longer.
