# C2S - L30 - Neoplasia 1

## Intended Learning Outcomes
- Define common terminology associated with neoplasia and apply naming conventions to types of neoplasia.
- Explain the concept of benign and malignant forms of neoplasia and describe the features associated with each type.
- Predict the effects of neoplasia in the body based on the knowledge of typical biological behaviours.

What is neoplasia
?
Occurs when cells no longer play their part in the body's "colony"
Cells do not respond to normal regulatory signalling
The growth and survival of neoplastic cells are prioritised over the needs of the host
Irreversible, persistent, unregulated cellular growth

What is the leading cause of death in dogs and cats::neoplasia

T/F The older an animal is the higher the chance of neoplasia

Does leukemia have to form a mass as it is a neoplasia::No it does not

How to outline tumour/mass vs neoplasm
?
A mass can be inflammatory (progranulin, cyst, granuloma, nodular hyperplasia, developmental malformation)

Outline benign vs malignant neoplasms
?
| Benign                                 | Malignant                                           |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Circumscribed with expansile growth    | Often poorly circumscribed with infiltrative growth |
| Does not metastasise                   | May metastasise                                     |
| Cells well differentiated              | Cells may be poorly differentitated (anaplastic)    |
| Usually grow slowly (low mitotic rate) | Usually grow quickly (high mitotic rate)            |
Both can be fatal but malignant neoplasia is far more challenging to successfully remove and treatment is less effective

What's in a neoplasm
?
Neoplastic cells
- Cells undergoing unregulated proliferation
- Any cell in the body can undergo neoplastic transformation
Stroma
- The tissue that supports the neoplastic cells
- Usually fibrous connective tissue with blood vessels
  - Also inflammatory cell populations
  - Provides growth factors, nutrients and protection for neoplastic cells
Interaction between stroma and neoplastic cells is important for the survival and propagation of tumour

Outline benign neoplasia
?
Well-circumscribed mass expanding and compressing surrounding tissue
Neoplasm not invading - very sharp demarcation, compresses surrounding tissue

Why might benign tumours be encapsulated but malignant ones wouldn't be::benign grows slower

Outline malignant neoplasia
?
Invasive, will enter other tissues
Destructive to adjacent tissues

What are surgical margins::Area around a tumour? If the area around the tumour has an area of no tumour it means you got it all

What is metastasis
?
Growth of neoplastic cells distant from the primary tumour
Spread of neoplasm to other locations NOT through direct invasion
- Haematogenous (goes through blood vessels), commonly in the lung and liver
- Lymphatic
  - Initially spread to draining lymph node
  - Progressive central spread along lymphatic vessels
  - May enter systemic circulation through the thoracic duct
- Implantation
  - Spread through body cavities
  - Sometimes called carcinomatosis

Outline poor differentiation of malignancies
?
Poor cellular differentiation is termed anaplasia
Features of anaplasia
- Cells have variable morphology (pleomorphism)
  - Variable cell size (anisocytosis), especially enlargement (macrocytosis)
  - Variable nuclear size (ansiokaryosis), especially enlargement (macrokaryosis)
  - Variable nucleolus size (anisonucleosis), especially enlargement (macronucleosis)
- Cells have increased nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio
- Nuclei may be dark staining (hyperchromatic)
- Abnormal mitsoes may be rpesent
  - Stellate, tripolar, or disorganized chromatin patterns
- Multinucleate cells (giant cells) may be present
- Cells lose normal orientation (no basal orientation on intestinal epithelial cells) and there is an architectural discontinuity (failure to form normal structures)

What is a leiomyosarcoma::smooth muscle malignant neoplasia

How do we classify neoplasm by cell type
?
Epithelial (endoderm or ectoderm origin)
Glandular tissue and tissues communicate with the "outside world"
- Glandular (sweat glands, pancreas, thyroid)
- Non-glandular (skin, respiratory, gastrointestinal lining)
Mesenchyma/connection tissue (mesoderm origin)
- Sometimes called spindle cells
- Intermediate tissues do not connect to the outside - generally structural
- Connective tissue, muscle, bone, cartilage, blood vessels, fat
Round cell
- Defined by lack of cohesion between cells
- Mostly leukocytes or related cells (lymphocytes/plasma cells, macrophages (histiocytes), melanocytes)
- Most are technically mesenchymal (melanocyte is an exception), but usually considered as a separate group

Outline neoplasms displaying multiple lineages
?
Some tumours contain cells from two or more germinal cell layers
- Mixed mammary tumours: Mix of neoplastic epithelial and mesenchymal cells
Teratomas
- Derived from pluripotent germ cells
- Can differentiate into any cell type

How do we name neoplasm?
?
The first part of the name is derived from the type of cell
The second part is based on cell lineage and malignancy
Benign neoplasms
- Epithelial cell lineage
  - Glandular epithelium: 'adenoma'
  - Non-glandular epithelium: 'papilloma' or other
- Mesenchymal cell lineage (oma)
Malignant neoplasms
- Epithelial cell lineage
  - Glandular epithelium: 'adenocarcinoma'
  - Non-glandular epithelium: 'carcinoma'
- Mesenchymal cell lineage: 'sarcoma'

What is an adenocarcinoma of the thyroid::Thyroid carcinoma, is an exception

What are some lesions that sound like neoplasms but are not
?
Hamartoma - Development malformation that forms a tissue mas
- Cells are non-neoplastic and incorrect site
Chrostioma - Developmental malformation results in normal cells in an abnormal location
- Cells are non-neoplastic but not in the correct site

What are the local effects of neoplasia
?

Distortion and compression (benign) or infiltration (malignant) of surrounding tissues
- Effects depend on the organ
  - Spinal cord -> paralysis
  - Splenic tumour -> no effect until very large
  - Brain -> Seizures, abnormal mentation, coma
  - Skull -> Seizures, abnormal mentation, coma
  - Liver/bile duct -> Biliary obstruction and jaundice
  - GI tract -> intestinal obstruction
  - Blood vessels/lymphatics -> oedema
- Ulceration and infection
Impairment of normal movement
Ulceration, infection

What are the systemic effects of neoplasia
?

Excessive secretion of normal hormones
- Normal cellular function but unregulated and excessive
- Gigantism -> Excessive growth hormone secretion by neoplastic pituitary cells continued growth throughout life and extreme height
- Hyperthyroidism caused by thyroid tumours
- Hypoglycemia is caused by insulin-secreting tumours of the pancreas (insulinomas)

What are the paraneoplastic syndromes
?
Due to the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines
- Interleukin 1 (IL-1)
- Interleukin 6 (IL-6)
- Tumour necrosis factor (TNF)
Neoplasia is a common cause of "fever of unknown origin"
Cachexia = weight loss regardless of caloric intake
- Caused by the release of 
  - Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF)
    - Appetite suppression
    - Increases protein catabolism
    - Stimulates lipolysis
- Catabolic factors produced by tumour (proteolysis-inducing factor)
Secretion of abnormal hormones: Excessive thyroid hormone secretion by a thyroid tumour is NOT a paraneoplastic disease
- Pseudohypoparathyroidism
  - AKA hypercalcaemia of malignancy
  - Mainly associated with lymphoma and anal gland adenocarcinoma
  - Neoplastic cells produce parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP), causing bone resorption which leads to hypercalcaemia
Testicular neoplasm producing oestrogen in male dogs and altered behaviour

Outline autoimmune disease caused by neoplasia
?
The immune response induced by abnormal antigen expression on tumours: Immune response cross-reacts with antigens normally present in the body
- Immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia
  - Caused by antibodies to neoplastic antigens crossreacting and binding to RBCs
  - Lysis of red blood cells and anaemia
Myasthenia gravis
- Caused by antibodies to neoplastic antigens crossreacting and blocking receptors for nerve signals
- Muscle weakness and collapse

What is a strangulating lipoma?
?
Usually found in older overweight horses. Lipomas that are pedunculated can entangle sections of the small intestine, leading to strangulation and vascular compromise

What is Hypertrophic osteopathy?
?
Periosteal bone production affects the bones of the limbs
Effect of mass development in the chest (not always neoplastic and sometimes also abdominal), but pathogenesis unclear

What is the majority of disease and welfare problems in exotic animals::poor husbandry

How often is exotic pet practice deliberate negligence::Rarely

Why do owners often lack information::Fail to seek advice, inadequate, misguided or incorrect information from breeders, pet shops, literature and the internet

What is the role of the vet in exotic pets
?
Veterinary practice should be a well-recognised and trusted source of information and the first port of call (which rarely happens)
Will help to prevent a large array of common but easily avoided diseases - welfare and economic benefits
Individual pets, breeders, suppliers, pet shops
Laboratory animal practice

What are the small animals
?
Range of domesticated and non-domesticated species - rodents, rabbits, ferrets, hedgehogs, marsupials, small primartes
Were children pets but no longer the case
Key areas of advice are
- Basic biology - sexing
- Nutrition
- Housing and environmental requirements
- Behavioural management

Outline the behaviour of small mammals
?
Rodents and rabbits are prey species
Easily stressed by sight, sound, smell of predators, unfamiliar surroundings, large bright open spaces
Adverse effects on gut health/motility and immune function
Hide overt signs of disease until advanced
Important to minimise stress at all times

Outline the two groups of rodents
?
Important differences in **dentition, diet, gastrointestinal function and reproductive strategies**
**Mouse, Rat, Hamster, and Gerbil** are Myomorphs - mouse-like rodents
**Guinea Pig (Cavy), Chinchilla, and Degu** are Hystricomorphs - porcupine-like
Third group is called **Scuiromorphs** which are squirrel-like and include chipmunks and prairie dogs

What are the keys of myomorphs
?
Constantly growing incisors but not cheek teeth
The reproductive strategy is altricial young which are poorly developed but only have a short gestation, and require maternal care
Omnivores diet

What are the keys of hystricomorphs
?
Long gestation and produced well-developed young and precocial young
Strict herbivores
Large hind gut for hindgut fermentors
High-fibre grass-based diet
Cheek teeth and incisors grow continuously
