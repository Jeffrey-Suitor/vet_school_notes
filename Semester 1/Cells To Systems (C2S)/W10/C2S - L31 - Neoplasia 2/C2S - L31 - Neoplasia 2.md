## Neoplasia 2

Outline oncogenes
?
An overactive version of normal genes that promote cell growth and proliferation (proto-oncogenes)
Activation may result in :
- Increased gene product expression
- Increased gene product activity
- Decreased gene product clearance/metabolism
Activation requires mutation of one gene copy (one hit)
Some types of proto-oncogenes include
- Growth factors and growth factor receptors (EGFR - epidermal growth factor receptor), the cell becomes more sensitive to growth factors
- Genes involved in cell signalling pathways (RESgene family)
- Genes promoting cell growth and division (cycling D1 - regulates movement through stages of cell division)
Autocrine signalling would tell the current cell to produce more growth factor and there would be a loop with no feedback control

Outline tumour suppressor genes
?
Genes that regulate cell growth (governing genes)
- Retinoblastoma (Rb) gene
  - Inhibits cell division until the appropriate time
Genes that monitor for pre-neoplastic changes in cells (guardian genes)
- Tumour protein p53 (altered in 50% of tumour types)
  - Senses DNS damage and signals cell cycle arrest or apoptosis
Inactivation leads to loss of regulation of cell proliferation and neoplasia
- Both gene copies need to be damaged (two hits)
- If you inherit a bad copy where it is deactivated it would require 1 hit instead of 2

Outline why elephants don't get cancers
?
Large, long-lived animals
Have lots of cells with lots of time to become neoplastic
The incidence of neoplasia should be high but it's not
Human genome mapping has p53 gene pair
Elephant genome contains 20 p53 gene pairs
- All 40 copies need to be inactivated to promote neoplasia

Outline DNA repair genes
?
Genetic defects accumulate over time
- Spontaneously
- Secondary to carcinogens
DNA damage is normally sensed and repaired by a  variety of repair genes
Defective or inactivated DNA repair genes result in poor maintenance of DNA integrity, accumulation of mutations and promotion of oncogenesis

Outline genes that regulate apoptosis
?
Apoptosis is the mechanism used to eliminate rogue cells that are on the path to neoplasia
Mutations impairing apoptotic pathway allow damaged cells to survive and continue progression to neoplasia

Outline the development of neoplasia
?
The multistep phenomenon with an accumulation of genetic defects
Neoplastic evolution: selective growth of best-adapted cells
In chemotherapeutic drug-resistant neoplasm, most die off but some will survive and will develop resistance
Antibiotic-resistant bacteria are similar
Both involve the same process - the selective growth of resistant clones
This is why we often combine therapies

Outline the hallmarks of neoplasia
?
1. Self-sufficiency in growth signalling
2. Insensitivity to anti-growth signals
3. Evasion of apoptosis
4. Limitless proliferation
5. Sustained angiogenesis
6. Altered cellular metabolism
7. Evasion of the immune system
8. Tissue invasion and metastasis (if malignant)

Outline self-sufficiency in growth signalling
?
Normal tissues require external signals. (growth factors) to proliferate
Neoplastic cells promote their own proliferation via:
- Oncogene activation: Reduces or eliminates the requirement for growth signals
- Persistent growth factor section
  - Self-secretion (autocrine signalling)
  - Inducing secretion by stroma

Outline neoplasm insensitivity to growth-inhibitory signals
?
Lack of ability to sense when things go bad (Tumour suppressor genes inactivated)
Don't care about personal space (Loss of cell-cell contact inhibition)
Ignore warnings to stop (Insensitive to inhibitory cytokines TGF-B)

Outline neoplasm evasion of apoptosis
?
Apoptosis is the major mechanism for eliminating damaged cells before they become fully neoplastic
Neoplastic cells are resistant to apoptotic signalling
- BCL-2 proteins suppress the intrinsic (mitochondrial) apoptotic pathway
- Overexpression of BCL-2 blocks initiation of apoptosis

Outline neoplasm limitless proliferation
?
Most cell types have limited proliferative capacity - Capable of 60-70 division cycles before entering senescence
Cellular senescence regulated by telomeres
- Short sequences at the ends of chromosomes
- Become shorter after each division cycle - once too short, the cell enters senescence
- Telomeres may be repaired by the enzyme telomerase but are not expressed by most normal cells
Production of telomerase means the neoplastic cell can continue to proliferate indefinitely

Outline neoplasm-sustained angiogenesis
?
Neoplasms require an additional blood supply to grow beyond 1-2mm in size
Induce neoangiogenesis or vasculogenesis via
- Persistent hypoxia
- Promoting secretion of angiogenic factors (VEGF)
- Suppressing angiogenesis inhibitors (thrombospondin-1)
Fast-growing tumours may still outgrow the blood supply leading to necrosis

Outline the altered cellular metabolism of neoplasms
?
Normal tissues
- Produce ATP via oxidative phosphorylation under aerobic conditions (uses oxygen)
- Produce ATP via glycolysis under anaerobic conditions (uses glucose)
Neoplastic tissues
- Produce ATP via glycolysis under aerobic and anaerobic conditions
- Aerobic glycolysis is inefficient compared to oxidative phosphorylation
- But, it allows neoplastic cells to proliferate regardless of oxygen levels (tumours often have intermittent hypoxia, but glucose is always available) and produces substrate chemicals for cell growth (acetyl CoA, NADPH)

Outline the neoplastic cell evasion of the immune system
?
Cytotoxic T cells can recognise and eliminate neoplastic cells
- Recognition of abnormal or aberrantly expressed antigens on tumour cells
Successful neoplasms avoid this
- Selective survival of cells that do not express immunogenic antigens
- Suppress antigen presentation to the immune system (reduced surface expression)
- Secrete immunosuppressive factors (TGF-B)
Histiocytomas - histiocytic neoplasm detected and destroyed by the immune system
Langerhans cell histiocytosis - Histiocytic neoplasm not detected by the immune system, proliferates and metastasises
Contagious neoplasms
- Devil facial tumours (Tasmanian devils), passed via biting
- Transmissible venereal tumours (dogs and most successful worldwide)
- Animals do not recognise the neoplastic cells as foreign in origin

Outline tissue invasion and metastasis in malignant neoplasms
?
Multiple adaptations required
Invasion
- Loosening of cell-cell contact
- Expression of enzymes (matrix metalloproteinases) to break down ECM
- Cell motility and migration
Metastasis
- Entry and survival in blood/lymphatics
- Expression of adhesion factors at metastasis site
- Survival and growth at the new site

What are the causes of neoplasia?
?
Carcinogens
- Agents that can neoplasia
  - Chemical 
  - Radiation
  - Microbial
Inherited
Spontaneous

What are the chemical carcinogens
?
Initiators (nitroamines)
- Directly cause DNA mutation (mutagens)
- Usually, electrophilic substances cause DNA cross-linking
Promoters (oestrogen)
- Promote survival and proliferation of mutated cells
- Allows accumulation of additional mutations in a susceptible population
- Examples include hormones or irritants causing hyperplasia
Complete (cantharidin, methylcholanthrene)
- have both initiating and promoting attributes
Soot wart
- Squamous cell carcinoma of the scrotum
- Seen in chimney sweeps due to soot exposure
Glyphosate
- Recently classified as a probable carcinogen
- Safety trials by Monsanto  found to be flawed or outright fraudulent
- Courts have awarded a total of 2.4 billion to found Roundup users who developed lymphoma
Tobacco smoke
Asbestos -> mesothelioma
Aflatoxin B (mouldy corn and peanuts) -> hepatic neoplasia
Bracken fern -> urinary bladder carcinoma

Outline radiation as a carcinogen
?
Typically needs sufficient energy to ionise tissues (break chemical bonds in DNA)
- Radio waves (including 5g), microwaves infrared
- X-rays, gamma radiation
- particle radiation (protons, neutrons, alpha particles)
Ionisation causes
- Chromosome breakage
- Chromosome rearrangement (translocations, inversion, deletions)
UV
- Not technically ionising but damages DNA through free radical production
- Melanin dissipates UV-B rays
- White cats are susceptible to the development of squamous cell carcinoma on unhaired areas of the body (ears, nose)

Outline microbial carcinogens
?
Direct
- Promotion of host oncogene expression - Retroviruses (feline leukaemia virus)
- Inhibition of tumour suppressors - Papillomaviruses (Accelerate degradation of p53 and Rb)
- The viral genome contains oncogene that mimics host transcription factors - Herpesviruses (gallid herpesvirus 2), Marek's disease in chickens
Indirect
- Chronic inflammation causes oxidative DNA damage
  - Hepatitis viruses 
  - Vaccination - feline vaccine-associated sarcoma
  - Microchip implantation in Gliders
