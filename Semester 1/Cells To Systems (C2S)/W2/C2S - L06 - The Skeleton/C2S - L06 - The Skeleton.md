# C2S - L6 - The Skeleton

## Intended Learning Outcomes

- Describe the position, relationships, form, and appearance of the major bones of the quadruped skeleton, information used to understand the skeleton scaffold within the body, radiograph, and as landmarks during clinical procedures
- Identify the major bones in novel animals, as not all animals treated by veterinarians will be domestic species

## The Skeleton

What bones compose the axial skeleton::skull, mandible, hyoid, vertebral column, ribcage

Describe the skull
?
Formed by an interlocking of many bones
- Fibrous joints between  = sutures
- Sutures flexible as animal growing, allowing changes in size and shape of skull
- Sutures infiltrated with bone and form a single structural unit in adulthood
Teeth reflect diet

Describe the mandible::2 bones, left and right, join at the intermandibular join and are fused with fibrocartilage suture which may be ossified

What bones of the skull are paired::incisive, nasal, maxillary, lacrimal, frontal, parietal, temporal (squamous, petrosal, tympanic), palatine, pterygoid, zygomatic, mandible

Which bones of the skull are not paired::Occipital, sphenoid complex (basisphenoid and presphenoid), vomer, ethmoid

Describe the hyoid bone
?
Suspends and supports the larynx, pharynx, and tongue
9 bones
- 4 paired
- 1 single
- Connecting tongue and larynx = hyoid apparatus
- Connecting tongue to temporal bone  = suspensory apparatus
Exact nature of hyoid varies between and within species

What is the alternate name for the C1 vertebrae and what is it's function::Atlas, supports head and only allows flexion and extension of the head

What is the alternate name for the C2 vertebrae and what is its function::Axis, that allows the head to rotate

What comprises the thoracic skeleton::Ribs + sternum

How many thoracic vertebrae are there::13

What is the name of the 1st sternum::manibrum

What is the name of the 8th sternum::xiphoid process which is elongated by the xiphoid cartilage?

What are the 5 regions of the spine::cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral, caudal

## Appendicular Skeleton
### Forelimb

What are the 3 bones in the pectoral girdle::Scapula, clavicle, coracoid

T/F the radius is cranial to the humerus::False, the humerus is cranial to the radius and ulna

T/F all animals have a radius and an ulna::False, animals such as horses have fused the radius and ulna as rotation of the distal limb is not desired

Describe the number of rows in the carpus and the bones found in each
?
2 rows of bones
1st row: radial, intermediate, ulnar, accessory
2nd row: carpal bones 1-4 (some species have 5)

What carpal bones are weight bearing::radial, intermediate, ulnar

How many metacarpal bones are there::5

Where do we start numbering for carpal bones::medially

How many digits and phalanges are there::5 digits with 2-3 phalanges, 3 phalanges except for digit 1 which has 2

What are the joints of the forelimb
?
Shoulder joint
Elbow joint:
- Radiohumeral
- Ulnarhumeral
Carpal joint:
- Radiocarpal joint
- Middle carpal joint
- Carpometacarpal joint
Metacarpophalngeal joint
Interphalangeal joints:
- Proximal interphalangeal joint
- Distal interphalangeal joint

### Hindlimb

What are the bones of the pelvic girdle
?
Left and right hip bones (os coxae)
- Illlium, ischium, pubis, acetabulum
Femur (& patella, other sesamoids)
Tibia, fibula
Tarsus (3 rows of tarsal bones):
- 1st row: talus, calcaeus,
- 2nd row: centrale
- 3rd row: tarsals 1-4 (sometimes 5)
Metatarsals 5 (5 metatarsal bones)
Digits 5 with 2-3 phalanges

Describe the joints of the hindlimb
?
Sacroilliac joint
Hip joint
Stifle joint:
- Femorotibial joint
- Femoropatella joint
Tarsal joint:
- Tibiotarsal joint
- Proximal tarsal joint
- Distal tarsal joint
- Tarsometatarsal joint
Metatarsohalngeal joints
Interphalangeal joints:
- Proximal interphalangeal joint
- Distal interphalangeal joint

What does a condyle or head mean when it comes to bones::Articular surface

What is an articular facet::Articular surface between vertebrae

What is a trochlea::Groove that keeps the patella moving in a proximal and distal direction

What is a process::A section of bone which extends outward

What is a tubercle::Bulge on the forelimb, trochanter for hindlimb

What is a fossa::Indentation in the bone, the cavity is a larger fossa.

What is a canal::tubular hole running through the bone, duct if very long and very tubular?

What is a foramen::Hole in the bone

What are some specialized bones in the body and their function
?
Sesamoids: patella is the largest in the body, bones that have formed in a tendon to help increase the strength of that tendon
Splanchnic bones: bones that have formed in soft tissue that are not involved in locomotion
- Os penis: present in many mammals
- Os cordis: most common in ox and sheep
- Os rosti: nasal bone in pigs
Pneumatic bones: found in birds, bones that have air inside to reduce weight
