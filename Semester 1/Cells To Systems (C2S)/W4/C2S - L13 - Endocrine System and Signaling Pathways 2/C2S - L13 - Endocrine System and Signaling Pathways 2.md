# C2S - L13 - Endocrine System and Signalling Pathways 2

What are the 4 types of G proteins, the receptors they interact with and their signalling pathway
?
| G protein | Receptor                                                              | Signalling pathway                                                     |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $G_s$     | $\beta$-adrenergic receptors, glucagon, histamine, serotonin          | Stimulatory increase cAMP                                              |
| $G_i$     | $\alpha_2$-adrenergic receptors                                       | Inhibitory, decrease cAMP                                              |
| $G_q$     | $\alpha_1$-adrenergic receptors, some muscarinic receptors, histamine | $IP_3$, DAG, Increase cytoplasmic $Ca^{++}$                            |
| $G_t$     | Light receptors in eye                                                | Transducin, increase cGMP phosphodiesterase (catalytic), decrease cGMP |

Describe how adrenalin and glucagon have the same effect in the liver::True, glucagon and adrenalin acting on the liver both share cAMP as their secondary messenger. They both use $G_s$ proteins, increase adenylate cyclase which increases cAMP, some enzymes are activated, act additively, and glycogen is broken down in both

Explain how a cell can be both upregulated and downregulated by G proteins at the same time. Name 3 stimulatory hormones and 3 inhibitory hormones in the liver adenylyl cyclase G protein pathway
?
Epinephrine, glucagon, and ACTH all bind to receptors that match a stimulatory G protein complex which causes increased Adenylyl cyclase activity leading to more cAMP.
$PGE_1$, Adenosine binds to receptors for inhibitory hormones which reduces adenylyl cyclase activity leading to a reduced cAMP output.

Describe how $G_q$ proteins function particularly referring to phospholipase C activation
?
1. Receptor ($\alpha_1$-adrenergic receptor) on vascular smooth muscle cells in the blood vessel. Ligand is a receptor
2. $G_q$ interacts with phospholipase C instead of heterotrimeric G protein
3. Phospholipase C splits $PIP_2$ into DAG and $IP_3$
4. $IP_3$ mobilises Intracellular $Ca^{++}$ within the organelles (sarcoplasmic reticulum)
5. $Ca^{++}$ acts as a secondary messenger due to an increase in cytosolic $Ca^{++}$ as the released $Ca^{++}$ will cause voltage-gated Ca channels to open causing more $Ca^{++}$ to rush in.
6. This increase in $Ca^{++}$ causes calmodulin to become Ca-calmodulin
7. Ca-calmodulin binds with Myosin Light Chain Kinase (MLCK) which phosphorylates myosin
8. Phosphorylated myosin can interact with actin to create a muscle contraction

What is nitric oxide (NO)
?
Labile (short-lived) gas molecule
Produced by cardiovascular endothelial cells
Causes vasodilation
NO donor compounds are used in the treatment of congestive heart failure

Describe the process of nitric oxide signalling
?
1. Acetylcholine (Ach) binds to the Muscarinic M3 receptor linked to Gq protein on endothelial cell
2. Causes cascade that activates NO synthase (eNOS)
3. Arginine converts to citrulline +NO
4. NO diffuses into adjacent smooth muscle cells
5. NO activates cytosolic guanylyl cyclase
6. CGTP is converted to cGMP
7. cGMP activates protein kinase G which phosphorylates muscle proteins to induce muscle relaxation

What stimulates endogenous NO release::bradykinin, acetylcholine, adenine nucleotides

Outline the process of $G_t$ signal transduction in the phototransduction of the retina
?
1. Light hits the Rhodopsin receptor which is G protein-coupled
2. The $\alpha_t$ subunit binds to phosphodiesterase 
3. Phosphodiesterase converts cGMP to GMP. 
4. The breakdown of cGMP leads to the closure of cGMP-dependent channels

T/F only the $\alpha$ subunit of the G protein can have an effect on its signalling pathway::False, the $\beta\gamma$ subunit can also have an effect

Compare ion channel vs G protein transduction $\beta\gamma$ signalling in the heart
?
Ionotropic receptor:
- Nicotinic Ach receptor
- Opens Na+ ion channel 
- Membrane depolarization
- Action potential produced
- Muscle contraction
- Skeletal muscle
Metrabotropic receptor:
- Muscarinic receptor (Ach mediated)
- G protein activated 
- $\beta\gamma$ subunit activates $K^+$ channel
- Opens $K^+$ ion channel
- Membrane hyperpolarization
- Decreased heart rate
- Cardiac muscle

T/F Receptor kinases don't need to signal via a G protein::True

Describe the process of activation of receptor kinases
?
0. There are two receptor kinases that each contain a tyrosine domain
1. Ligand binds
2. Kinase activity is stimulated
3. Tyrosines are phosphorylated
4. Intracellular proteins bind to phospho-tyrosine docking sites

Describe the steps involved in the mechanism of action of the insulin receptor
?
1. When the insulin receptor binds insulin, the activated receptor phosphorylates the IRS-1 protein, IRS-1 can lead to the recruitment of GRB2, activating the Ras pathway
2. IRS-1 activates PI 3-kinase which catalyses the addition of a phosphate group to the membrane lipid $PIP_2$. Thereby converting it to $PIP_3$, PTEH can convert $PIP_3$ back to $PIP_2$
3. $PIP_3$ binds a protein kinase called Akt, which is activated by other protein
4. Akt catalyses the phosphorylation of key proteins, leading to an increase in glycogen synthase activity and recruitment of the glucose transporter, GLUT4, to the membrane

Describe the steps involved in the mechanism of action of the growth factor
?
1. Growth factor binds to the receptor domain causing a conformational change and forming a dimer
2. Tyrosine autophosphorylation occurs causing the SH2-domain to bind. Sh2-domain protein recognises specific phosphotyrosine-containing regions of tyrosine kinase
3. Binding and phosphorylation of SH2-domain protein leads to enzyme activation and transcription factor activation which leads to altered gene transcription and tissue response

What are water-soluble hormones and how do they function
?
Amines (other thyroid hormones)
Peptides and proteins, Eicosanoids
1. First messenger (hormone) binds to a membrane receptor
2. Activated receptor sets off a cascade that activates an enzyme
3. Enzyme reaction produces a second messenger (e.g. cAMP)
4. Second messenger produces a response in the cell

What are lipid soluble hormones and how do they function
?
Steroids
Thyroid hormones (amines), Nitric oxide
1. Diffuse through the plasma membrane (except thyroid hormones which are transported)
2. Bind to specific receptors in the cytoplasm or nucleus
3. Hormone and receptor bind to DNA
4. Gene is transcribed or deactivated
Receptors (>80 identified) include those for:
- Corticosteroids (glucocorticoid, mineralcorticoid) cytoplasm
- Se hormone receptors (estrogen, testosterone)
- Thyroid hormone receptors (nuclear)

What are type 1 nuclear receptors and how do they function
?
These receptors bind to steroids and are located outside and must translocate to inside the nucleus
1. Ligand binding to type 1 nuclear receptor (NR) in the cytosol
2. Dissociation of inhibitory heat shock proteins (HSP)
3. Receptors homodimerization
4. Translocation to the nucleus (active transport)
5. Binding to specific DNA (HRE)
6. Activate RNA polymerase or inhibit certain genes
Examples include cortisone and aldosterone

Describe glucocorticoid receptor signalling
?
1. Cortisol passes through the cell membrane
2. Bind glucocorticoid receptor (GR)
3. Forms non-DNA binding oligomer
4. Oligomer dissociates to form active GR monomer
5. GR monomers from DNA-binding homodimers
6. These pass through nuclear pores and bind to glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) to activate transcription

What are type 2 nuclear receptors and how do they function based on retinoic acid and thyroid hormone
?
These bind to a variety of thyroid hormones and are always located inside the nucleus
1. NR located in the nucleus
2. Thyroid hormone receptor (TR) heterodimerized to the retinoic acid receptor RXR
3. TR is bound to the corepressor protein. OFF
4. Ligand binding to TR causes dissociation of corepressor and recruitment of coactivator protein. ON
5. Activate RNA polymerase that is responsible for transcription
Common hormones include thyroid hormones

What are the 5 key aspects of hormone signalling and what is important about each
?
1. Specificity: 
  - A high receptor ligand specificity
  - Non-covalent interactions
2. Amplification: 
  - First messengers are often short-lived and in low concentrations
  - Induce key intracellular signalling proteins to behave as a molecular switch.
  - Amplification proceeds usually via enzyme cascades 
3. Integration
  - Cells must frequently receive multiple signals
  - Must be coordinated with integrated cellular response 
4. Rapid decay
  - Hormones give short-term, reversible messages so the system must decay relatively rapidly
5. Desensitisation
  - Often achieved by a feedback loop 
  - The target may be the receptor - affinity, activity, or expression
