# C2S - L11 - Principles Of Cell Communication

## Intended Learning Outcomes
- Define the terms autocrine, paracrine, endocrine and synaptic signalling and explain why these different types of signalling processes exist
- Describe the anatomical and functional arrangement of the Hypothalamo-Pituitary axis and how this axis regulates the release of pituitary hormones
- List the hormones produced by the anterior and posterior pituitary and describe their main functions

## Communication Between Cells

How and why do cells communicate with each other
?
The ability of cells to communicate with each other is critical to coordinate activities required for homeostasis, growth and development
Direct contact: gap junctions and cell surface signalling molecules
Through chemical messengers: autocrine, paracrine, hormonal, synaptic signalling

What are gap junctions and provide an example in the heart::enable direct communication between adjacent cells. The signals are passed via cell cytosis which allows for quick signals for coordinated functions. Gap junctions between cardiomyocytes enable action potentials to propagate.

How does cell-cell recognition/interaction work and provide an example using the endothelial cells::involves signalling molecule presented on one cell with a receptor on an in-contact cell, allows site-specific binding (leukocyte binding to endothelial cells)

Provide an overview of signalling molecules and detail the 5 processes for intercellular communication
?
The most common communication process uses extracellular chemical messengers
Specific chemical messenger is synthesised in specialised cells to be released for action on target cells
Five signalling processes for intercellular communication:
1. Autocrine
2. Paracrine
3. Endocrine
4. Synaptic
5. Neuroendocrine

Outline the process of autocrine signalling
?
In autocrine signalling, secreted molecules diffuse locally and trigger a response in the cells that secrete them
A common mechanism in immune cells

Outline the process of paracrine signalling::In paracrine signalling, secreted molecules diffuse locally and trigger a response in neighbouring cells. Distributed by simple diffusion which restricts the action to short distances. Molecules rapidly taken up by cells or degraded via extracellular enzymes: can create a signalling concentration gradient

How does histamine release from mast cells function::paracrine signalling, mast cell binds to IgE antibody, degranulate histamine, histamine diffuses and causes a local immune response. Histamine causes vasodilation of blood vessels and causes localised edema.

Outline the process of endocrine signalling::In endocrine signalling, secreted molecules diffuse into the bloodstream and trigger responses in target cells anywhere in the body. Secreted hormones are long-distance chemical messengers that travel in the bloodstream and exert their effect on target cells in distant sites. Only the target cells of a hormone have the specific membrane receptor for that hormone. Non-target cells are not influenced by hormones that contact them.

What are the major endocrine glands in the body?
?
Hypothalamus and Pituitary gland
The pineal gland (melatonin)
Thyroid gland (TH) and Parathyroid gland (PTH)
Adrenal gland (cortisol, adrenalin/epinephrine, aldosterone)
Pancreas (insulin, glucagon)
Ovaries (oestrogen, progesterone)
Testes (testosterone)

What key homeostatic processes does endocrine signalling contribute to
?
Blood pressure and volume
Solute concentrations and body fluids
Growth and development

What type of feedback controls homeostasis::negative feedback

Outline synaptic signalling::In synaptic signalling, neurotransmitters diffuse across synapses and trigger responses in cells of target tissues (neurons, muscles, or glands). Neurons communicate with cells they innervate (target cells) by releasing neurotransmitters which are short-range chemical messengers released in response to electrical signals

Outline neuroendocrine signalling::In neuroendocrine signalling, neurohormones diffuse into the bloodstream and trigger responses in target cells anywhere in the body. Neurohormones are released into the bloodstream by neurosecretory neurons to act at distant sites, and neurosecretory neurons respond to an electrical signal. Neurohormones act like classical hormones but are released from neurons

What is the location of the hypothalamus and pituitary?
?
Located at the base of the brain
Hypothalamus is part of the brain
The pituitary gland is a small endocrine gland
They are connected by a thin connecting stock
The release of hormones from the pituitary is directly controlled by the hypothalamus

What is the role of the hypothalamus::receives information from nerves throughout the body, initiates neuroendocrine signalling in response, signalling controls the functions of the pituitary

What is the name of the stalk that connects the pituitary to the brain::infundibulum

Compare the anterior and posterior pituitary
?
|             | Anterior                    | Posterior |
| ----------- | --------------------------- | --------- |
| Tissue type | Glandular epithelial tissue | Neural tissue          |

Describe the structure of the posterior pituitary
?
Extension of neural tissue in the hypothalamus
Neurosecretory cells in the hypothalamus synthesise ADH and oxytocin
These are packaged into secretory vesicles and transported to the posterior pituitary along the axon
These are stored in the posterior pituitary and released in response to nerve signals in the brain
Enter into a plexus of blood capillaries - act as neurohormones

What are the two main functions of Antidiuretic hormone (ADH, also known as vasopressin)
?
1. Retention of $H_2O$ In the kidneys
2. Contraction of arteriolar smooth muscle

What are the two main functions of oxytocin
?
1. Controls ejection of milk during breast-feeding
2. Contraction of the uterus during labour

Explain the process of oxytocin signalling
?
1. Suckling causes the release of Oxytocin from neurosecretory cells.
2. Oxytocin travels down the axon to the posterior pituitary where it is circulated throughout the body
3. Oxytocin binds to the target cells which causes the release of milk in the mammary glands
4. Positive feedback loop

Describe the structure of the anterior pituitary gland
?
Hypothalamic neurons release neurohormones
Neurohormones travel directly to the anterior pituitary in the portal system
They trigger the release of hormones from endocrine cells located in the anterior pituitary

What is the process used int he anterior pituitary
?
1. Neurons synthesising trophic neurohormones release them into capillaries of the portal system
2. Portal veins carry the trophic neurohormones directly to the anterior pituitary where they act on endocrine cells
3. Endocrine cells release their peptide hormones into the second set of capillaries for distribution to the rest of the body

Describe the endocrine axis aka anterior pituitary feedback
?
1. Hypothalamic releasing and inhibiting hormones
2. Production of hormones in the anterior pituitary
3. Production and secretion of hormones from peripheral glands
4. Hormones will have negative feedback on hypothalamic neuroendocrine neurons and on the pituitary gland

What is the difference between long-loop and short-loop negative feedback?
?
The long loop is when the final hormone acts as negative feedback on both the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary
The short loop is when the hormone secreted from the anterior pituitary acts as negative feedback on the hypothalamus

Describe how the body might regulate a drop in thyroid hormone levels in the blood
?
1. Hypothalamus sense a drop in thyroid hormone levels
2. Hypothalamus releases TRH which travels to the anterior pituitary
3. Anterior pituitary releases TSH into the bloodstream and reaches the thyroid gland
4. TSH stimulates endocrine cells in the thyroid gland to secrete thyroid hormone ($T_3$, $T_4$) into the circulatory system
5. Thyroid hormone levels increase in the body. The thyroid hormone acts on target cells throughout the body to control bioenergetics; help maintain normal blood pressure, heart rate, and muscle tone; and regulate digestive and reproductive function
6. Thyroid hormone does negative feedback on both the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary
