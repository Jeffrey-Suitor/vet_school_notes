# C2S - L12 - Endocrine System and Signaling Pathways

## Intended Learning Outcomes

- Describe the main signal transduction pathways involved in cell signalling; in order to understand how drugs and hormones stimulating these pathways cause their actions.
- Describe through the use of examples how G protein signal transduction pathways are regulated; in order to understand how hormone and drug actions are modulated and switched off.
- Describe how bacterial toxins such as cholera toxin and pertussis toxin are able to interfere with heterotrimeric G protein signalling; in order to understand how bacterial toxins may cause disease via these signalling mechanisms.

## Signal Transduction

What traits do hormone receptors exhibit
?
Specificity, affinity, saturability, reversibility (deactivation)
Cell surface or intracellular
Active cellular responses (ion channel permeability, enzymes or changes in gene expression)

Outline the cellular signalling cascade
?
1. Signal reception
2. Primary transduction (conformational change)
3. Relay (modulation by other factors)
4. Amplification (second messengers; enzymes)
5. Divergence to multiple targets
6. Responses (altered metabolism; gene expression; movement; etc.)

T/F Cells only interact with a single molecule::False, cells interact with many molecules and it is the sum of these molecules that determines the action of the cells

What are 4 common second messengers::cyclic AMP, cyclic GMP, Ca++, Diacylglycerol

T/F Receptor protein tyrosine kinase does not have a secondary messenger molecule::True

What kinase is activated by each of the following molecules: cyclic AMP, cyclic GMP, Ca++, Diacylglycerol, Receptor protein tyrosine kinase
?
Cyclic AMP: PK-A
Cyclic GMP: PK-G
Ca++: Calmodulin: Multifunctional kinases and dedicated kinases
Diacylglycerol: PK-C
Receptor protein tyrosine kinase: Protein Ser/Thr kinases

Provide an overview of ligand-gated ion channel structure and give an example of an external ligand
?
Many ion channels open or close in response to binding a ligand, some ion channels are gated by extracellular ligands, while some are by intracellular ligands
Acetylcholine (ACh) is an ionotropic receptor, Nicotinic Ach receptors, Open Na+ ion channels, depolarization

Describe the release of acetylcholine for neurotransmission
?
The arrival of an electrical stimulus triggers the release of acetylcholine, which binds to the acetylcholine receptor on the muscle cell
This activates the entry of sodium which causes a local membrane to depolarize
Acetylcholinesterase degrades the transmitter, terminating the signal

Provide an overview of G protein-coupled receptors
?
Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins
The largest family of cell surface receptors (>1000 genes encode for GPCRs)
7 transmembrane domains
Coupled to intracellular effect systems via G proteins in the 5/6 intracellular loop
Includes receptors for many hormones and transmitters (muscarinic AChR; adrenergic receptor)

Provide an overview of basic GPCR-mediated signalling systems
1. GPCR with external and internal loops binds with a heterotrimeric G protein at the guanine
2. Heterotrimeric G protein can inhibit or stimulate an effector molecule
3. Effector molecule triggers secondary messenger
4. Eventually the signal from the secondary messenger will phosphorylate cytosolic or nuclear proteins
5. The phosphorylated proteins will cause a cellular response to the stimulus

What is the minimum number of $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$ subunits heterotrimeric G proteins have::23 $\alpha$, 12 $\gamma$, 6 $\beta$

What are 3 common types of effector molecules involved in G protein signalling::Phospholipase $A_2$, Phospholipase C, Adenylate cyclase, calcium channels

What are the base state and 5 active states of GPCRs
?
0. The receptor is inactive, the effector is inactive, trimeric $G_s$ protein, bound GDP
1. Binding of hormones induces a conformational change in receptor
2. Activated receptor binds to $G_\alpha$ subunit
3. Binding induces a conformational change in $G_\alpha$; bound GDP dissociates and is replaced by GTP, $G_\alpha$ dissociates from $G_{\beta\gamma}$
4. Hormone dissociates from receptor; $G_\alpha$ binds to an effector, activating it. The response depends on the effector proteins
5. Hydrolysis of GTP to GDP causes $G_\alpha$ to dissociate from the effector and reassociate with $G_{\beta\gamma}$. $G_{\beta\gamma}$ subunits can also activate downstream effectors

Detail the example of G protein activation using adrenalin in the liver
?
1. Adrenalin binds to an adrenergic receptor
2. When activated GDP and GTP are exchanged in the G protein
3. alpha subunit dissociates and along with GTP binds to Adenylate cyclase
4. Adenylate cyclase converts ATP into cAMP

Describe the adrenaline/adrenergic receptor pathway
?
1. G protein $\alpha$ subunit with GTP actives adenylyl cyclase
2. Adenylyl cyclase hydrolyses ATP to cAMP
3. cAMP binds to PKA regulatory subunit and releases the PKA catalytic unit
4. Catalytic unit is phosphorylated
5. Activated PKA phosphorylates glycogen phosphorylate enzyme
6. Glycogen is broken down into glucose

Outline how cyclic AMP can activate protein kinase A
?
A cAMP-dependent kinase (PKA) is composed of two regulatory (R) and 2 catalytic (C) subunits
Binding of cAMP to the regulatory subunits induces a conformational change that reduces their affinity for the catalytic subunits
The complex dissociates and the catalytic subunits are free to catalyse the phosphorylation of protein substrates
Their effect is amplified where a single molecule can eventually impact $10^6$ molecules

In G proteins how do we downregulate ligand-receptor interaction
?
Activation via the G protein system occurs only while hormone-receptor conjugates persist
Depends on hormone concentration and lifespan in the blood
Many receptor hormone conjugates are internalised and 'new' receptors are expressed: ligand-induced receptor internalisation through clathrin-coated pits
Proteins called $\beta$-arrestins bind to GPCr and downregulate a response to prolonged hormone exposure (desensitization)
- Inactive GPCR
- Promote removal by endocytosis

How does the ground state of G protein-coupled receptors act as a form of regulatory control?
?
Initially $G_{\alpha\beta\gamma}$ are one unit until activated and the GDP is swapped out for GTP and the GTP and $G_\alpha$ subunit dissociates. This dissociation can only occur for a limited amount of time as the GTP will eventually hydrolyse back to GDP and the $\alpha$ subunit will rebind

How can cAMP be degraded to AMP and why is that important and what role do caffeine and theophylline play::phosphodiesterase can convert cAMP to AMP which allows for further control of G proteins by reducing the amount of secondary messenger activation cAMP can perform. Caffeine and theophylline limit phosphodiesterase and allows cAMP to remain in the cell longer 

What role do intracellular protein phosphatases play in regulating G proteins?
?
Remove the phosphate groups from key enzymes affected by their addition in the first place (deactivation of protein kinase A)
The balance between kinases (adding phosphates) and phosphatases (removing phosphates) activity plays a major role in the control of signalling events

Outline the process of reversible phosphorylation
?
Kinases add a phosphate group onto the OH group of a tyrosine threonine or serine residue by cleaving ATP. This affects change and causes a conformational change.
Phosphatase breaks these phosphate groups off and returns the protein back to its original state

How does cholera leverage reversible phosphorylation::cholera toxin inhibits G protein hydrolysis by interfering with the $G_\alpha$ subunit by inhibiting the hydrolysis of the GTP to GDP which prevents the G protein from returning to its resting state which means that the system remains active longer. This means that a more cyclic AMP second messenger is produced.

What is the effect of cholera toxin on salt and water balance? Detail the entire process from entry to result
?
1. Cholera toxin enters intestinal crypt cells across the apical membrane
2. The toxin $\alpha$ subunit detaches and catalyses ADP ribosylation (addition of a ribosome unit) of the $G_{\alpha s}$ protein coupled to adenylyl cyclase. This inhibits GTPase activity and GTP cannot be hydrolysed back to GDP
3. GTP remains permanently bound to the $G_{\alpha s}$ subunit and Adenylyl cyclase remains activated
4. cAMP levels 100x higher than normal
5. Cytosolic PKA is over-activated
6. PKA phosphorylates cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) $Cl^-$ channel proteins ATP mediated secretion of $Cl^-$ ions
7. Leads to the secretion of other ions
8. Water loss of up to 2L/h

How does the binding of the cholera toxin cause the $G_\alpha$ subunit to remain active
?
1. Hormone binding to receptor promotes a conformational change and nucleotide exchange
2. $G_{\alpha s}$ activates adenylyl cyclase
3. Cholera toxin ADP-ribosylates the $G_\alpha$ subunit of the G protein that activates adenylyl cyclase
4. $G_\alpha$ can no longer hydrolyse GTP

How does pertussis toxin increase cAMP by blocking G protein-coupled receptors::Pertussis toxin adds ADP-ribose onto the $\alpha$ subunit and because the G protein is inhibitory it will cause a reduction in cAMP
