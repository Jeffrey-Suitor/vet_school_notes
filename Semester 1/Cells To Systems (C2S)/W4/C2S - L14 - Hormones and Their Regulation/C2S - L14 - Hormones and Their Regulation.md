# C2S - L14 - Hormones and Their Regulation

## Intended Learning Outcomes
- For each of the different groups of hormones, be able to describe their site of production and main biological function - in order to understand disease processes where glandular tissues are affected or hormone actions are increased or decreased.
- Describe (using specific hormone examples) how hormone secretion is regulated and how negative and positive feedback processes modify their secretion; in order to understand how certain pathological processes can interfere with the production of a hormone.

What are peptide hormones, where are they produced and what are some examples?
Chains of specific amino acids
Hypothalamus, pituitary, pancreas, parathyroid gland, kidneys, liver, heart, and GI tract
Insulin, vasopressin, TSH, calcitonin

What are Eicosanoid hormones, where are they found, and what are some examples
?
Arachidonic acid derivatives, usually act as autocrine or paracrine signalling molecules but can act distally
4 families of eicosanoids: prostaglandins, prostacyclins, thromboxanes, and leukotrienes

Describe peptide hormone formation, transport, and binding
?
Formation:
- Preprohormones (rough endoplasmic reticulum) -> prohormones -> active hormones
- Golgi complex concentrates the finished hormones and they are stored in secretory vesicles
- Appropriate stimulus usually $Ca^{++}$ results in exocytosis
Peptides (hydrophilic) are transported as free hormone dissolved in plasma
Bind to specific cell surface receptor on target cells: activates second messenger -> cascade effect
Because they are hydrophilic they don't are usually free hormones in the blood which results in a relatively short half-life (a few minutes)

Describe the formation of insulin
?
1. Proinsulin is cleaved to form the connecting peptide (C peptide) and insulin ($\alpha$ and $\beta$ chains)
2. Packaged in secretory granules

Receptor site: Surface of the target cell
Action: Ion channel changes or second messenger system

What is insulin, what does it target, and what its functions, and what is its receptor
?
An anabolic hormone produced in the pancreatic $\beta$ cells in times of excess nutrient availability
- Allows the body to use carbohydrates as energy sources and store nutrients
Targets: Liver, muscle, adipose tissue
Functions:
- Lowers blood glucose levels
- Increases facilitated diffusion of glucose into cells
- Increases conversion of glucose into glycogen (glycogenesis)
- Increases uptake of amino acids and protein synthesis
- Increases synthesis of fatty acids (lipogenesis)
- Slows glycogenolysis
- Slows gluconeogenesis
Insulin receptor:
- Example of the enzyme-linked receptor (tyrosine kinase)
- Tyrosine phosphorylation triggers multiple pathways

Describe the regulation of insulin secretion
?
Glucose is most important regulator of insulin secretion
Factors controlling insulin secretion:
- $\beta$ cells monitor levels of circulating metabolites
  - Glucose
  - Leucine and alanine
    - Amino acids have little effect in absence of glucose increase, but they double insulin release in combination with glucose
- Neuronal and hormonal
  - Parasympathetic stimulation
  - CCK (cholecystokinin)
  - Gastric hormones stimulate the 'Anticipatory' release of insulin
  - Other hormones, e.g. glucagon, growth hormone, and cortisol

Describe the regulation of catecholamine and give 3 examples and where are they secreted from, and what is it's effects
?
Stress is the major stimulation of adrenalin and epinephrine release
- The threat, noise, excitement, high temperature
The catecholamines are synthesised in sequence from tyrosine
No negative feedback loop. Action is stopped mainly by degradation as these hormones have a very short half-life
Dopamine, Norepinephrine, Epinephrine
Adrenal medulla primarily (Epinephrine), and in nerve endings (Dopamine, norepinephrine)

Detail the regulation of T3 and T4 secretion
?
Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) formed in the hypothalamus -> response to blood levels T3/T4
TRH is released into portal veins of the hypothalamic hypophyseal tract
Simulates thyrotropes to release TSH into the blood
TSH stimulates follicular thyroid cells to produce and secrete T3 and T4
As the level of T3/T4 rise, negative feedback loops reduce the synthesis of TRH in the hypothalamus (long arm) and the release of TSH in the anterior pituitary (short arm)

?
20 carbon-containing compound
Many different prostaglandins and other bioactive products derived from arachidonic acid
Prostaglandins, Thromboxanes, Leukotrienes
Prostaglandins are produced by most cells (from the cell wall)
Eicosanoids not stored by cells -> produced on demand
Involved in the inflammatory response

What is the role of phospholipase $A_2$::Convert phospholipids into Arachidonic acid

What does Cyclooxygenase do to arachidonic acid::converts to prostanoids (prostaglandins, thromboxanes)

What does lipoxygenase do to arachidonic acid::Converts to leukotrienes

What is the function of prostaglandins::vasodilators to regulate blood flow

What is the function of thromboxane $A_2$::induces platelet aggregation, promotes vasoconstriction, used when bleeding and the body wants to stop it

  - The build-up of glycogen stores

How does cortisol act as an anti-inflammatory::inhibits arachidonic acid production and prostaglandins

How is cortisol production regulated?
?
Negative feedback
pituitary and hypothalamus by cortisol: A long feedback loop
Hypothalamus by ACTH: a short feedback loop

What is oxytocin, where is it produced, what is its role, where is it released, and where are the receptors
?
Peptide hormone (9 aa)
Produced in supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei
Acts as a neurotransmitter in the brain
Released by the posterior pituitary
Oxytocin receptors are smooth muscle cells in either the mammary gland or the uterus

What is the role of oxytocin in milk ejection during lactation
?
Milk is initially secreted into alveoli (sacs) within the mammary gland
OCT stimulates the contraction of myoepithelial cells (smooth muscle cells) which surround alveoli
Suckling causes a neurogenic reflex from the spinal cord to the hypothalamus which causes neuroendocrine cells to synthesise oxytocin which is released from the posterior pituitary. This oxytocin is released from the nerve terminal where it enters the blood causing the contraction of myoepithelial cells and allowing for milk letdown which causes increased suckling

What is the role of oxytocin in uterine contractions during parturition?
?
Important in cervical dilation and uterine contractions
After birth maintains homeostasis and evacuation of the placenta
Positive feedback where estrogen induces contractions of the uterine wall. This stretching causes the release of oxytocin which causes more uterine contractions which causes more stretching.

What are some of the diseases associated with increased or reduced hormone activity
?
Tumours: 
- Hyperthyroidism due to thyroid tumour - increased T3 and T4
- Increased cortisol due to benign pituitary tumour - Cushing's disease (caused by a tumour making more ACTH)
Immunological causes:
- Grave's disease - autoimmune hyperthyroidism (targets TSH receptors)
- Type 1 diabetes - autoimmune destruction of pancreatic islet cells (inability to produce insulin)
Genetic disorder (absence of enzyme)
Dietary deficiency - Hypothyroidism due to insufficient iodine (common in sheep)

What might be some diseases caused by increased removal from blood or transport deficiencies?
?
Liver disease - reduced plasma protein binding, due to there not being enough available transport proteins for lipophilic proteins to bind to

What might be some diseases caused by transduction failure - an adequate hormone, but target cells don't respond
?
Receptor deficiency or disorders of signalling pathway-transduction, insulin resistance where the insulin is downregulate because there is no receptors that are stimulating glucose update

What are some important indicators for type 2 diabetes
?
High levels of glucose concentration
Sweet odour
Cataract
Weight loss
