## Short Answer Questions:

1.  Describe the main difference between the functions of smooth muscle and skeletal muscle.
Skeletal can contract (voluntary), has strong muscle fibres with many nuclei
Smooth muscle cannot contract (involuntary) and is more flexible
    
2.  Briefly explain the role of the Golgi apparatus in post-translational modification of proteins.
Packages modified proteins for vesicular transport out of cell
    
3.  What is the main function of the cell membrane?
Maintain a concentration gradient, organization, sensing, communcation, acting as a barrier
    

## Long Answer Questions:

1.  Explain the concept of homeostasis and the role of negative and positive feedback mechanisms in physiological systems. Provide examples to support your answer.
Negative regulates back down to set point. Thyroid hormone too low -> thyroxin in anterior pituitary -> Release of thyroid-stimulating hormone. Thyroid stimulating hormone downregulates thyroxin
Positive regulates away from the set point. Oxytocin -> Contractions -> Stretch -> Oxytocin
    
2.  Discuss the relationship between cells, tissues, organs, and body systems in terms of their anatomical structure and physiological functions. Use examples to illustrate your points.

Cells are the smallest unit -> Tissues are groups of cells combined for functions -> organs are a collection of tissue and body systems are collections of organs. Cells are the smallest, and usually most specialized. As sizes increase the system becomes more complex and intertwined.
