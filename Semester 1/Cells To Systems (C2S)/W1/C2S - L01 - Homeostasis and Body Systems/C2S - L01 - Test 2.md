Multiple Choice:

1.  d) Periderm
2.  d) Organ & Body Systems
3.  b) Smooth muscle
4.  c) Golgi apparatus
5.  a) Metabolism
6.  a) Nervous tissue
7.  b) Endoplasmic
8.  c) Urinary system
9.  d) Covering organ surfaces, lining hollow surfaces, and forming glands
10.  b) Peroxisome

Short Answer:

1.  Negative feedback counteracts changes in a system, often by negating the original stimulus, contributing to homeostasis. Positive feedback amplifies changes in a system and does not contribute to homeostasis. It is found in dramatic events like birth, with a defined endpoint.
    
2.  Major cell components include the cell nucleus (containing DNA and nucleolus), ribosomes (sites of translation and protein assembly), endoplasmic reticulum (involved in protein and lipid synthesis and intracellular Ca2+ storage), Golgi apparatus (post-translational modification and protein packaging), mitochondria (oxidation of carbohydrates and lipids to generate ATP), lysosomes (intracellular digestion), peroxisomes (detoxification), cytoskeleton (maintaining and changing cell shape and movement), and cell membrane (selective barrier function, communication, and selective transport).
    
3.  Differentiation is the process by which cells develop new functional characteristics. It involves changes in gene expression and cellular function. For example, naive immune cells can differentiate into immune effectors, or hematopoietic stem cells can differentiate into erythrocytes or various types of white blood cells.
    

Long Answer:

1.  The levels of structural organization in animals are: cellular level (basic structural and functional unit of the body), tissue level (groups of cells from the same origin performing a specific function), organ level (two or more different types of tissues performing particular functions, e.g., heart, liver), and body systems (associations of organs with a common function, e.g., musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, immune and lymphatic systems).
    
2.  Homeostasis is the ability of physiological systems to maintain conditions within the body in a relatively constant state of equilibrium. It is essential for the survival of individual cells and the entire animal. Homeostatic mechanisms involve a stimulus, a receptor, a control center, and effectors. An example of a homeostatic mechanism is the regulation of body temperature. When the body temperature increases, thermoreceptors in the skin detect the change, and the hypothalamus acts as a control center to regulate effect
