## Short Answer Questions:

1.  Explain the difference between negative and positive feedback in physiological systems.
    
2.  Describe the function of the major cell components found in animal cells.
Golgi, Endoplasmic (Smooth, Rough), Nucleus, Cell membrane, mitochondria, lysosome, peroxisome, 
    
3.  Explain how cells can develop new functional characteristics through the process of differentiation.
Differentiation allows cells to become specialized in different domains by selecting preferred traits by upregulating or downregulating genetic expression. Examples include developing motility appendages for movement.
    

## Long Answer Questions:

1.  Describe the levels of structural organization in animals, starting from cells up to body systems. Provide examples for each level.
    
2.  Explain the general concept of homeostasis and its importance in maintaining the internal environment within limits compatible with life. Give an example of a homeostatic mechanism involving feedback.
Important to maintain range, too far outside not optimal and can lead to death.
Birth -> oxytocin -> Positive feedback
Negative feedback -> cold, shiver to warm up, stop shivering so not to heat up too much
