Multiple Choice Questions:

1.  a) Smooth muscle cells in the walls of blood vessels
2.  d) Heteroderm
3.  d) Circulatory tissue
4.  a) Rough endoplasmic reticulum
5.  b) Lysosome
6.  b) Maintain equilibrium
7.  c) Labor contractions during childbirth

Short Answer Questions:

1.  Smooth muscle is involuntary, non-striated, and found in the walls of internal organs like blood vessels, the gastrointestinal tract, and the respiratory tract. It contracts to control the size of the lumen and propel substances through the organ. Skeletal muscle is voluntary, striated, and attached to bones via tendons. It contracts to move body parts and generate heat.
    
2.  The Golgi apparatus is responsible for post-translational modification of proteins, such as glycosylation, phosphorylation of sugars on glycoproteins, and sorting and packaging proteins into secretory vesicles for transport to their final destinations.
    
3.  The main function of the cell membrane is to serve as a selective barrier between the interior and exterior of the cell, controlling the passage of substances in and out, and facilitating communication through receptors and transport processes.
    

Long Answer Questions:

1.  Homeostasis is the ability of physiological systems to maintain conditions within the body in a relatively constant state of equilibrium. It involves maintaining the internal environment within limits compatible with life, and it is a dynamic process that responds to changes in conditions. Negative feedback mechanisms counteract changes by negating the original stimulus, contributing to homeostasis. For example, when body temperature rises, sweating occurs to cool the body down, and when body temperature falls, shivering generates heat to warm the body. Positive feedback mechanisms amplify changes and do not contribute to homeostasis. They are found in dramatic events with defined endpoints, like childbirth. During labor, the hormone oxytocin stimulates and enhances contractions in response to pressure receptor stimulation in the birth canal. Once the baby is born, the stimulation is removed, and oxytocin production stops.
    
2.  Cells, tissues, organs, and body systems are interrelated in terms of their anatomical structure and physiological functions. Cells are the basic structural and functional unit of the body, and they perform specific functions depending on their specialization. Tissues are groups of cells from the same origin that carry out a specific function, such as nervous, connective, muscle, and epithelial tissues. Organs are structures made up of two or more different types of tissues that perform particular functions, like the heart, liver, stomach, and kidneys. Body systems are associations of organs that have a common function, such as the cardiovascular, respiratory, and digestive systems. The integration of these levels of organization is essential for maintaining homeostasis and the overall functioning of the organism. For example, the cardiovascular system, composed of the heart, blood vessels, and blood, works together to transport oxygen, nutrients, hormones, and waste products throughout the body, ensuring that cells receive the necessary substances to function and maintain homeostasis.
