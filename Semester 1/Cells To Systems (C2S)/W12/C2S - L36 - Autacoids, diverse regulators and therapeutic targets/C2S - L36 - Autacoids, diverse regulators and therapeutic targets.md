# C2S - L36 - Autacoids, diverse regulators and therapeutic targets

## Intended Learning Outcomes
- Describe what an ‘autacoid’ is and give examples of agents that belong to this category.
- Describe the synthesis, storage and biological effects of histamine and bradykinin (including their receptors) and the clinical uses of histamine receptor antagonists (H1 antihistamines and H2 receptor antagonists).
- Describe how eicosanoids are generated with particular emphasis upon the key roles played by the enzymes PLA2, cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase and explain how prostaglandins and leukotrienes produce their biological effects and their major actions in the body.
- Describe how commonly used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (glucocorticoids) interfere with the production of eicosanoids (and additional pathways)

## Autocoids

Outline chemical signalling between cells
?
Release of molecules
- Neurotransmitters (wired networks)
- Hormones (broadcast)
- Local mediators (shouting)
Membrane-bound molecules
- Immune system (cellular neighbours)
Exosomes

Outline exosomes
?
Protein-protein interactions
They are part of lipid layers that are released between cells
Cancer cells release exosomes
Maybe targeting with drugs

Outline autocoids
?
A diverse group of (patho)physiological mediators
Often considered as defense mediators - formation and release associated with **infection and inflammation**
Are important therapeutic targets
**Modulatory Functions**
- Smooth muscle tone/length
- Glandular secretion
- Permeability for vascular and airway
- Sensory nerves (pain and itch)
Autocacoid - Self remedy
Multiple interacting mediators include
- Histamine
- Bradykinin
- Eicosanoids
  - Prostaglandins
  - Leukotrienes
Normally act locally because they are quite labile or are rapidly broken down close to their site of release

Outline histamine
?
Largely stored in and released from 
- mast cells (tissues - particularly mucosal surfaces/skin)
- basophils (blood)
Enterochromaffin-like cells (GIT) - regulate stomach acid secretion
Also peripheral and central **histaminergic neurones**

Outline mast cells and histamine
?
igE -> FcER1 -> eicosanoid, histamines (main), cytokines

Outline histamine and it's categories
?
Mediates its activities through interacting with 4 distinct receptors H1, H2, H3, H4
All are GPCRs
Therapies
- H1R antagonism - allergic disease (mainly)
- H2R antagonism - peptic ulcer disease (and related conditions)
- H3R antagonism - narcolepsy
- H4R antagonism - non approved yet (pruritus)

Outline H1 receptor antagonists 
?
Antihistamines
Competitive, reversible antagonists of H1 receptors
Useful in treating
- Hayfever (allergic rhinitis)
- Atopic dermatitis (adjunct to glucocorticoids)
- Urticaria
- Anaphylaxis and angioedema (adjunct to adrenaline)
- Bites and stings

Outline H2 receptor antagonists
?
Peptic ulcer treatment
- Blockbuster drugs
- Cimetidine/Ranitidine
Improved understanding of the condition has led to alternative methods of treating peptide ulcers

Outline peptides and proteins mediators
?
Can range in size from a few amino acids to many hundred residues
Vasodilation at the site of injury
endothelial contraction leading to plasma exudation

Outline bradykinin
?
Local peptide mediator in pain and inflammation
Generated after plasma exudation during inflammation
Prekallikrein (inactive plasma protein) -- activated Hageman factor --> Kallikrein
Kallirein -- High molecular weight kininogen (inactive plasma protein) -> Bradykinin
Vascular
- Dilate arterioles and venules (released PGs / NO)
- Increased vascular permeability
Neural
- Stimulate sensory nerve endings (pain)
GPCR B2 and B1 receptors
Clinical use: limited at present
 - Selective receptor antagonist icatibant (hereditary angioedema)

What is the active component of augus cures
?
Salicylate
Synthetic salicylates are made. - cetylsalicylic acid (asprin)
Found to have anti-pyretic (fever), analgesic and anti-inflammatory actions

Outline the bioactive components in semen
?
Contraction (or relaxation) of the uterus observed during artificial insemination
In vitro/vivo - contraction of smooth muscle and reduction of blood pressure demonstrated when semen/reproductive gland extracts administered
Active components thought to be from prostate gland -> prostaglandins

What are prostaglandins
?
20 carbon-containing compounds - eicosanoids
Structural similarity to essential fatty acids -> arachidonic acid

What are the types of prostaglandins
?
Prostaglandins -> prostanoids
Thromboxanes -> prostanoids
Leukotrienes 

T/F most cells produce prostaglandins::True

T/F eicosanoids are synthesised on demand::True

Outline the generation of eicosanoids
?
Cytokine, inflammatory mediator, another stimulus, or mechanical trauma increases Ca2+
Ca2+ activates phospholipase A2 (PLA2) which liberates arachidonic acid (AA)
Very low levels of free AA in resting cells
PLA2 liberation of AA is the rate-limiting step

Outline cyclooxygenase COX
?
Prostanoids
- Prostaglandins
- Thromboxanes
Converts prostaglandins into intermediaries, PGG2 -> PGH2
cell-specific synthase enzymes convert PGH2 into specific prostaglandins
- PGI2, prostacyclin, vascular endothelium
- PGF2A, uterus
- PGD2, mast cells
- PGE2, most cells
- TXA2, platelets
Inhibited by NSAIDs

Outline lipoxygenase LOX
?
Leukotrienes
5 lipoxygenase is mainly in inflammatory cells and can make
LTB4
LTC4 -> LTD4 -> LTE4 (cysteinyl-leukotrienes), first identified in activated leukocytes

How do eicosanoids produce an effect?
?
Act via GPCRs
Not super selective
The subsequent generation of second messenger molecules

Outline prostaglandins in inflammation
?
Reddening - vasodilation at initiating site
Wheal - increases vascular permeability
Pain - PGE2 sand PGI are hyperalgesic (increase the sensitivity of receptors to painful stimuli)
Fever - Inflammation -> Neutrophil acitvation -> Cytokines -> PGE2 -> Raise temperature
Act as inflammatory

Outline glucocorticoids
?
Bind to receptors inside the cell to modify gene transcription
Potent anti-inflammatory agents
Inhibition of the eicosanoid synthesis pathway 
- Inhibits COX/PLA2 induction
- Generate an inhibitor of PLA activity
Broad inhibition of the generation of cytokines
Inhibition of adhesion molecules etc.
