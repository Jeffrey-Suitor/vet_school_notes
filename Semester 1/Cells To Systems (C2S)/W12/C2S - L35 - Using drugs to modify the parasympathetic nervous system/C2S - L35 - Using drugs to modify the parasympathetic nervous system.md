# C2S - L35 - Using drugs to modify the parasympathetic nervous system

## Intended Learning Outcomes

- Describe the synthesis, storage, release and inactivation of acetylcholine (ACh) and how certain drugs are able to modulate cholinergic NS activity through alteration of the above processes
- Describe how ACh receptors are divided into subtypes and the pharmacological basis for this division, and explain the functional difference between muscarinic and nicotinic receptors
- Give examples of agonists and antagonists that have selective activity at ACh receptors
- Describe the basic signal transduction mechanisms that ACh receptors employ to produce their functional effects

## ACh

Why do we not target the ganglionic transmission of ACh::Can has many effects

What are the 8 areas you can target pharmacological modulation of the synapse
?
1. Arrival
2. Synthesis
3. Storage
4. Metabolism
5. Release
6. Uptake
7. Degradation
8. Receptor (pre and post)

Outline Ach synthesis
?
Choline moved via choline carrier
Mitochondrion makes AcetylCoA
Choline + AcetylCoA -- Choline acetyltransferase -> Acetyl choline + CoA
Acetylcholine brought into vesicles by the ACh carrier

Outline the release of Ach
?
AP -> Lets calcium in -> Release Ach

What does Botulinum Toxin (BoTox) to ACh
?
Prevents ACh release
Snare proteins on Ach vesicle and neuronal membrane
Botox inside cleaves snare proteins meaning that it cannot bind
Botox is an enzyme
Long-lived effects because proteins need to rebuild
Type A botox can be used to remove wrinkles (paralysis of facial skeletal muscle)
Blepharospasm can be treated via Botox type A

Outline ACh inactivation and anticholinesterase
?
Acetylcholine Esterase (AChE) breaks down Ach -> Choline and acetate
Choline uptake is not limiting
Anticholinesterase drugs keep ACh activation longer by targetting AChE
- Physostigmine (and others)
  - More activity at parasympathetic NS
  - Used to treat glaucoma
- Neostigmine (and others)
  - More activity at NMJ
  - Used to reverse the effect of non-depolarising neuromuscular blockers 
  - Used to treat myasthenia gravis (dogs)

Outline irreversible anticholinesterases
?
Organophosphates (insecticides)

## Receptors

Outline nicotinic receptors
?
5 subdomains
Have a closed core but when the ACh bin opens allow Na entry
NMJ (Nm) and Ganglia (Nn)

Outline muscarinic receptors
?
M3 (smooth muscle, glands)
- Gq -> phospholipase C increase-> PIP2 -> IP3 + DAG -> PKC activation + Ca2+ mobilisation -> GIT contraction and secretion
M2 cardiac
- Gi -> adenylate cyclase reduce -> Atp to decrease cAMP -> decrease heart rate

Outline muscarinic receptor actions
?
SLUD
- Salivation
- lacrimation
- urination
- Defecation
Sweating
Slowing of heart
Bronchoconstriction
Vasodilation (non-neural effect)

What are some clinical uses of cholinoceptor agonists (muscarinic receptor agonists)
?
Pilocarpine: Glaucoma (in dogs)
Carbachol: GIT and bladder paralysis
Bethanecol care is required obstruction

Outline cholinoceptor antagonists
?
Muscarinic antagonists: Blockade of the parasympathetic NS (parasympatholytics)
- Atropine (some hyoscine) deadly nightshade
- Hyosine (some atropine) angels trumpet
Nicotinic antagonists
- Neuromuscular blocking drugs
  - Non-depolarising 
  - Depolarising
- Ganglion blocking drugs

What are the effects of atropine?
?
Anti-SLU
Ocular: dilated iris and loss of accommodation
Tachycardia
CNS effects (depending on dose)
- Agitation, restlessness, disorientation, coma

What are some clinical uses of antimuscarinics?
?
General 
- Antispasmodics (gut/airway smooth muscle)
- Ophthalmological use - dilation of the pupil permits examination of the eye
Atrop/glycopyrrolate
- Reduce secretions and produce bronchodilation (pre-anaesthetic)
- AChE-inhibitor poisoning
- Bradycardiac
Hyoscine
- Motion sickness
Ipratropium (and others) (inhaled)
- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)/Asthma

Outline neuromuscular blocking agents
?
d-tubocurarine
- Pre-operative muscle relaxation (artificial ventilation required)
- Replaced clinically by 'better' agents - rocuronium
Competitive reversible antagonist / 'non-depolarising' blocker
- Block reversed with neostigmine
Less effect at autonomic ganglia - but can block at high concentrations
'Depolarising' blockers (suxamethonium)

Outline toxicology of cholinergic NS
?
Insecticides can effect cholinergic NS
Danger of poisoning from feedstuffs
