# IVP - L27 - Normal Embryogenesis 2

## Intended Learning Outcomes
- Describe the basic processes in which the three germ layers contribute to the formation of the major organ system in order to explain tissue structures and organ locations in the final body plan.
- Explain the embryonic body folding in order to outline the transformation from flat embryonic disc to 3-dimensional embryo.

## Formation of 3 germ layers (Gastrulation)

Describe the population of gastrulation
?
Hatched blastocyst: Trophoblasts on the outside, inner cell mass on the inside (ICM)
In ICM cells are growing are and start to form the primitive endoderm which grows around the blastocoel
When it grows all the way around it makes a yolk sac in the centre with a primitive endoderm (Hypoblast) and trophectoderm on the outside. 
The trophoblast layer above the ICM begins to degenerate
ICM becomes a thick single-cell layer (embryonic disc) (epiblast)

Outline the formation of the primitive streak
?
Median thickened area of embryo
Defines carnio-caudal / longitudinal axis of the embryo in the centre, the **primitive groove** forms which funnel cells 'inside' to form mesoderm and endoderm

Describe the Notochord formation
?
Primitive streak regresses
- primitive node (cranial end of the primitive streak) continually shifts closer to the caudal pole of the embryo
- Cells around primitive nodes are deposited beneath the ectoderm and form the notochord
Notochord
- Signals required for midline symmetry and neural tube formation
- Marks future location of the vertebral column

What are the 4 extra-embryonic membranes
?
Amnion
Allantois
Chorion
Yolk sac

What do mammalian foetal membranes develop
?
Form a connection with the uterus
Measure thickness to look for placentitis
If the membrane fails to rupture the foal can suffocate in horses
Retention of fetal membranes can lead to systemic issues

Describe the development of the extra-embryonic membranes
?
1. Primitive endoderm forms a yolk sac surrounded by primitive endoderm and trophectoderm
2. Mesoderm begins to grow reducing the size of the yolk sac
3. As mesoderm grows it pushes trophectoderm out into wing-like shapes. These amniotic folds continue to grow and eventually grow
4. This creates an amnionic cavity
5. As the primitive gut forms from the primitive endoderm, from the hindgut the outgrowth of the allantois occurs.  Eventually will surround and will eventually form with the chorion. This is the foetal part of the foetus
In ruminants connects are formed in distinct round shapes called plasmatomes, which can be palpated to age a foetus

## Organogenesis

What are the 3 layers of 
?
Ectoderm
Mesoderm
Endoderm

What is neurulation
?
Transformation of ectoderm to nervous tissue in response to a signal from notochord (promotes cell proliferation leading to the neural plate, neuroectoderm formation)
Neural folds develop along with the neural groove
Neural folds converge towards the midline with neural tube and surface ectoderm
Neural crest cells arise from dorsolateral cell migration of neural tube cells
CNS from the neural tube, PNS from the neural tube and neural crest cells

What are the placodes
?
Thickening of surface ectoderm in cephalic region stimulation by neuroectoderm
- Nasal chamber, lens (lens placode), inner ear (otic placode)
- Sensory components of some cranial nerves

Outline the paraxial mesoderm
?
The first 7 **somitomeres** contribute to head structures and pharyngeal arch formation caudal to the distinct blocks (**somites**)
The axial skeleton, associated musculature and dermis

What does the intermediate mesoderm form::Parts of the reproductive and urinary system

Outline the lateral mesoderm
?
Mesoderm layers -> serous membranes lining cavities = serosa
Coelom -> pleural, pericardial, peritoneal, cavities
Composed of the somatic mesoderm, splanchnic mesoderm and intra-embryonic coelom
Somatic forms with ectoderm to make somatopleure, splanchnic forms with ectoderm to be splanchnopleure

What are the derivatives of the gut tube
?
Derived from the fore-gut:
- Parts of the oral cavity
- Pharynx/Oesophagus
- Stomach/ proximal to duodenum
- Thyroid/parathyroid/thymus
- Trachea and Lung
Derived from mid-gut:
- Duodenum to the transverse colon
Derived from hindgut:
- The distal part of the transverse colon to descending colon
- Cloaca -> anal canal / urogenital sinus

What are the high-level formations from the endoderm?
?
**Epithelium** of primitive gut, respiratory tract, bladder, parts of the hearing system
**Parenchyma** of the liver, pancreas, thyroid, parathyroid

Provide a high level overview of the germ layers
?
Ectoderm:
- Skin (Epidermis), hair, nails, horns, hooves, mammary glands, oral/nasal epithelium, parts of the eye
- Nervous tissue formed from neuroectoderm including the brain, spinal cord, peripheral nerves
Mesoderm
- Connective tissues including cartilage, bone, blood cells
- Muscle (skeletal, cardiac, smooth)
- Parts of the urinary reproductive system; heart
Endoderm
- The epithelial lining of the gastrointestinal tract, parenchyma of the liver and pancreas
- The epithelial lining of the respiratory tract and parts of the urinary/reproductive system

Outline the role of embryonic folding
?
Required to transform embryonic disc to 3-dimensional embryo
2 perspectives:
1) Median plane: Head process and tail fold develop -> C-shaped embryo, oral plate joins the endoderm and ectoderm, this leads to sub cephalic pocket which is the primitive mouth
2) Horizontal plane: Lateral folding and gut tube formation. Mesoderm covering body cavities separates from that lining the extra-embryonic membranes

Describe the formation of the pharyngeal arches and pouches
?
Neural crest cells contribute to mesoderm
Separation of arches is the pharyngeal pouches
1st pharyngeal arch makes the maxillary and mandibular processes (respective bones + muscles of mastication)
2nd arch (hyoid arch) -> forms hyoid bone, some facial muscles
3rd, 4th, 6th, form part of the hyoid, larynx, pharynx, and facial muscles
Pharyngeal pouches -> auditory tube, tonsils, thymus
