# C2S - L29 - Disorders of Tissue Mass and Cell Differentiation 2

## Intended Learning Outcomes
- Use appropriate terminology to describe acquired lesions characterised by excess tissue mass or altered tissue differentiation 
- Explain the factors that promote tissue hypertrophy, hyperplasia, metaplasia and/or dysplasia 
- Explain the potential consequences of these processes.

## Increases in Tissue Mass

What is hypertrophy::Increase of tissue mass due to an increase in size

What is hyperplasia::Increase of tissue mass due to more cells

What is physiological hypertrophy::Bodybuilding, response to stimulus, increase nucleus size, increase sarcoplasmic volume, more and bigger mitochondria, more actin + myosin, more ribosomes, more myofibrils

What is the purest example of hypertrophy::Myocardial sizes are permanent and therefore when it grows its not more cells but a bigger size

What are some examples of physiological hypertrophy
?
Athletic animals, bigger more muscle hearts, more collagen, more muscle mass, and larger bones
One kidney grows in size to take over the workload of the other kidney, glomeruli grows bigger, tubular epithelium grows, compensatory hypertrophy
Size of the uterus during pregnancy, to be able to carry the young animal
Oftentimes reversible, these hypertrophic structures will disappear with animals when the stimulus is removed

What are some examples of pathologic hypertrophy
?
Thick internal intestine, potential obstruction below, chronically increased workload, remove the obstruction and it should revert overtime
Chronic bronchitis can cause smooth muscle hypertrophy
Red clover contains estrogenic compounds which can cause an enlarged clitoris, hormonal stimulation
Anabolic steroids, cause increased muscle size

Outline some potential consequences of hypertrophy
?
Normally reversible in both hypertrophy and hyperplasia
Usually considered to be a benefit to the animal
In hyperthyroid cats, there is excess blood pressure, and the heart has to push harder resulting in myocardial hypertrophy in the left ventricle
Hearts that grow in this way have a reduced lumen and due to a lack of supporting blood vessels are more at risk of ischemic necrosis, myocardial infarction

Outline hyperplasia
?
Caused by an increase in tissue mass due to increases in cells
CELLS MUST BE ABLE TO UNDERGO MITOTIC DIVISION

What are some examples of physiological hyperplasia
?
Hyperplasia of sows when they have piglets, a majority is through additional cell creation in mammary tissue
Stress -> ACTH -> More cortisol -> Adrenal cortices are growing 
Pituitary tumour producing more ACTH -> Thickness a combination of hyperplasia and hypertrophy
Thyroid gland enlargement, goitres, iodine deficiency, hypothalamus and pituitary release TSH which tells the thyroid to grow and mitotically divide to create T3 and T4 (hyperplasia and hypertrophy)
Mammary enlargement hyperplasia 
Cystic mucosal hyperplasia of the uterus driven by progesterone, during the diestrus period leads to hyperplasia, hypertrophy and increased mucous secretion
Benign prostatic hyperplasia which is caused by hyperplasia due to androgen imbalances
Callus formation, primarily hyperplasia
Tonsil enlargement, spleen enlargement, gingival hyperplasia (lymphoid hyperplasia)
Granular tissue is advantageous to hyperplasia, all reversible
Cat pancreas nodular hyperplasia of the parenchyma


What is metaplasia
?
Reversible
Process of fully differentiated cell type, to a related cell type, mainly in epithelial structures, squamous epithelial is the main one
Smoking converts columnar to stratified squamous in the throat smoking
The advantage of epithelial metaplasia is that they are stronger and more robust, not making mucous anymore, and loss of specialized function

Provide some more cases of squamous metaplasia
?
Chronically irritated airways can undergo this process
This happens over time and gradual programming of the basal cells
Chronic irritation of the bladder epithelial undergoes squamous metaplasia
Glandular metaplasia undergoes squamous metaplasia, producing keratin

Outline glandular metaplasia
?
chronically irritated stomach mucosa
Chronic parasitism can change mucosa from complex stomach to mucosa that is largely made of mucous-secreting cells, reduced gastric pH
In gastric acid reflex, the distal oesophagus can be converted to glandular forms with mucous secretions, reversible
Metaplasia can become tumours and lead to neoplasia, same with hyperplastic cell populations

What are some examples of metaplasia in connecting tissue?
?
Bone formation in connecting tissue, fat to bone -> no obvious advantage, not often reversible
Chronically damaged joints can lead to additional bone formation
Dura mata can have bone plate formations which can sometimes press on the spinal cord, same with the dura in the skull

Outline the use of dysplasia for acquired cell changes
?
Chronically irritated cell populations, preneoplastic change
Squamous metaplasia: Cells become progressively flattened towards the surface
Dysplastic epithelium: There is still flattening of the surface layers indicating differentiation, but some of the deeper cells are larger with nuclear irregularity and some loss of the normal arrangement. Can occur without squamous metaplasia but often together

What is the most common type of cancer::squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, typically poorly haired skin, skin without melanin pigment, goes through stages of chronic UV damage, collagen fibres in the dermis, hypoplasia of the epidermis, hyperkeratotic epidermis

What is the word for solar-induced skin damage::Actinic

What is neoplasia::a neoplasm is an abnormal mass of tissue, the growth of which exceeds and is uncoordinated with that of normal tissue and persists in the same excessive manner after cessation of the stimuli which evoked the change. Never reversible. never to the host's advantage. Can kill the host if malignant. 

What is a feature of malignancy::Marked polymorphism, differing nucleus size, can't tell cell of origin, increased mitotic rate, asymmetric mitosis

What does anaplasia::loss of differentiation
