# C2S - L28 - Disorders of Tissue Mass and Cell Differentiation 1

## Intended Learning Outcomes
- Use appropriate terminology to describe congenital lesions characterised by deficits of tissue mass or disorderly tissue development.
- Describe the characteristic gross and microscopic features of atrophy.
- Explain the factors that contribute to cell and tissue atrophy.

## Disorders of  Congenital Disorders

What does congenital mean::it was present at birth (observation not a cause)

What can cause congenital defects::genetic abnormalities, drugs induced, hypoxia?

What is the meaning of agenesis::Something did not form (kidney did not form, left renal agenesis)

What is aplasia::Incomplete development (not commonly used)

What is hypoplasia::under development (failed to achieve full size), the discrepancy in kidney size, hypoplastic kidney

What is cerebella hypoplasia::Cerebellum used for coordination, hypoplastic cerebellum, usually due to feline parvovirus, is often caused by viruses, in pigs caused by hog cholera, in cows caused by bovine viral diarrhoea virus

What is the special term for insufficient eye development::microphthalmia which is caused by vitamin A deficiency

What is the meaning of segmental aplasia::developmental abnormality that applies to a segmented structure

What is the meaning of atresia::Absence of an opening

What is atresia ani::There is no anal opening

What is the meaning of dysplasia::The cell populations inside are disorganised (aplasia will look smaller, dysplasia will look different on the cut surface)

What is chrondrodysplasia::Poor organisation of growth cartilage particularly bone, bulldog chondrodysplasia cattle have poor bone growth

What are the consequences of congenital malformations?
?
Sometimes such as webbed feet, there are no consequences or may even be an advantage
Atresia ani --> death sentence
Agenesis you can survive with single-sided kidney agenesis but not double sided

What are the 4 major cell adaptations?
?
A consequence of severe physiological stress or injury. Cells are modified to survive in this environment.
Atrophy - Cells shrink in size
Hypertrophy - Cells grow in size
Hyperplasia - Increased number of cells
Metaplasia - Replacement of a cell type by another of the same germ line (low columnar -> squamous in metastasis)

Outline atrophy
?
Survive by doing less work and get rid of unnecessary functions
Cells alive, but reduced metabolic function
Less synthesis
More catalysis
More malformed proteins and autophagy (part of the cell membrane) occur
Autophagosome connects to lysosome so that autophagolysosomes are formed
There are residual bodies that cannot be digested, golden brown appearance
If there is a lot of lipofuscin it can discolour

Outline the gross appearance of atrophy
?
Reduced mass
Can be reduced in size or number

Outline the histology of atrophy
?
Ducts become more obvious as the parenchyma shrinks
If you divert portal veinous return but they undergo atrophy making connecting vessels more pronounced
Acinar grooves in the exocrine pancreas undergo atrophy in malnutrition

Can atrophy be reversed::Yes, but it takes time

What are some examples of when atrophy is not reversible
?
A lot of scar tissue
Long-term muscle atrophy with loss of motor nerve input is not reversible

What are some of the causes of atrophy
?
Decreased workload (disuse) -> Only relevant to bone, muscle, and connective tissue
Loss of motor innervation -> Only pertinent to skeletal muscle
Decreased blood supply
Decreased hormonal stimulation -> Mainly endocrine tissues
Obstruction of secretory/excretory ducts -> Only relevant to tissues that have them
Inadequate nutrition
Ageing

What are some examples of processes that cause atrophy
?
Physiological
- Cow suckling udder that is weaned leads to udder parenchyma atrophy
Pathological:
- Decreased workload (disuse), animals with paralysis

Outline how motor innervation can lead to atrophy
?
animals hit by cars lose radial nerve innervation, which doesn't regrow in 6-12 months it may be permanent
Roaring syndrome is caused by injury to the left recurrent pharyngeal nerve

Give examples of how decreased blood supply can lead to atrophy
?
Decreased blood supply, congenital portosystemic shunt, restoring portal flow will restore function
Pressure atrophy, caused by pressure caused by things such as tumours or abscesses which cause atrophy, reduced blood flow
In hydronephrosis, urine puts pressure on vessels causing cell death (loss of medullary size)

Give examples of how decreased hormonal stimulus can lead to atrophy
?
Removal of the testes causes shrinkage of the prostate (2-3 days shrink down to very small)
Adrenal gland, reduced ACTH, leading to reduced adrenal cortex depth

Give examples of the obstruction of secretory/excretory ducts
?
Pancreas, exocrine parenchyma disappears because of obstruction of the pancreatic duct
Gall bladder and blocked bile duct outflow will cause parenchyma degradation
Salivary glands that are blocked, the parenchyma will atrophy

Outline how inadequate nutrition leads to atrophy
?
Malnutrition, starvation
Inability to absorb, diabetes
Tumours that are competing for energy will cause atrophy
Bone. muscle, connective tissue, and fat, all undergo atrophy

Outline serous atrophy of fat
?
Pink tinge because as you lose adipocyte content you can see blood vessels better
Jelly like consistency
Very watery
Subcutaneous fat stores, visceral fat stores, and any animals that need to rapidly mobilise their fat sores

Outline serous atrophy of bone marrow fat
?
Very bad, do not want to see
Very last fat store that will be pulled from
Chronic stage of malnourishment

Outline small intestinal villous atrophy
?
Smaller than expected
Diarrhoea because it can't absorb 
Villus atrophy, mechanisms include viral, bacterial, enterocytes, chronic inflammation, neoplasia
Too much sloughing or not enough cell production

Outline progressive atrophic rhinitis
?
Bacterial disease
Damage in the nasal mucosa

What is abiotrophy
?
Genetically programmed (normally autosomal recessive)
Healthy cells sometimes undergo premature degradation and sometimes death
Can cause a large atrophy
In cerebellar abiotrophy, the cerebellum is normal size, but due to autosomal recessive, Purkinje neurons die off, the cerebellar granular sizes atrophy, border collies, lambs, piglets, early onset
With many issues with eye early onset atrophy, Alaskan malamutes lose daytime vision

Outline the process of ageing
?
We don't know how to stop ageing
Reproductive organs atrophy with age because of hormonal reduction
A gradual reduction in skeletal muscle mass and reduction in fat stores
Osteoporosis reduces bone size
Lymphoid tissue reduces the bone size
CNS atrophy in very old age

What factors influence lifespan
?
Genes
Nutrition
husbandry, good hygiene
Good vaccination
Natural diseases (chronic low thyroid, etc.)

What is cellular ageing
?
Aged cells look abnormal
Nucleus change may look bloated, vacuoles in mitochondria, lipofuscin (neurones, cardiac muscle)
Older cells are not as good as younger cells, not taking on as many nutrients or making as much repair or synthesis

What are some factors that impact cellular aging?
?
Reduction of DNA repair -> Accumulation of mutations
Various genetic abnormalities (IGF-1) -> Abnormal cellular signalling
Environmental insults -> Free radical-mediated damage -> Accumulation of damaged cellular proteins and organelles
Reduced proteasomal activity -> Accumulation of damaged cellular proteins and organelles
Replicative senescence -> Reduced ability to produce new cells

What was the first animal that was cloned::Dole the sheep

What shortens each time the cell does a mitotic division::Telomeres, which protect chromosomes from mutations

What causes cataracts::Accumulation of glycation of non-enzymatic glycosylation end products

T/F Smaller animals are more likely to die early::True, due to a higher metabolic rate

What is the best way to prevent ageing::Caloric restriction
