# IVP - L26 - Normal embryogenesis I

## Intended Learning Outcomes
- Explain fertilisation and the normal developmental stages of the embryo after fertilisation and in order to understand their clinical relevance
- Describe the origin and basic function of the extra-embryonic membranes in order to understand their relationship with the developing embryo and the surrounding uterus

What is a conceptus::Everything that develops from the zygote (product of conception), embryo/fetus, extra-embryonic membranes

What is the Embryo (that which grows)::organism in early stages of development (blastulation and gastrulation), usually not identifiable as a member of a species

What is the Fetus::fetus is more defined than an embryo, and can be recognized as a member of the species or from organogenesis to terms, the fetal stage ends with expulsion from the uterus (neonate)

What is the high-level overview of early embryonic development?
?
1. Fertilisation
2. Development inside zona pellucida (cell division = Cleavage)
3. Hatching of the blastocyst
4. Formation of 3 germ layers (Gastrulation)
5. 
  1. Formation of extra-embryonic membranes
  2. Organogenesis/Basic body plan formation

Describe the uterus in cows
?
Contains a cervix that is very deep (entrance to the uterus)
Uterine body with two uterine horns
Fallopian tubes
During mating the male deposits sperm either outside or inside the cervix
Uterine body -> Uterine horn -> Uterine tube --> oocyte if the right time (fertilisation)
The oestrus is the only time when a female will stand to be mated

T/F sperm can remain in the uterine tube for multiple days::True

Provide a brief overview of the primary oocyte
?
1. Primary oocyte (diploid)
2. 1st meiosis (puberty)
3. Secondary oocyte (haploid) + First polar body
4. 2nd meiosis (after fertilisation) Diploid zygote + second polar body
4 spermatozoa out of the primordial cell

What is the zona pellucida
?
thick transparent non-cellular layer around the oocyte
Needs to be penetrated by a sperm cell
Changes once first sperm penetrated (zona reaction) --> prevents polyspermy
Prevent embryo from growing in size

Describe the process of fertilisation
?
Spermatozoon penetrating corona radiata (done by motility and enzymatic reactions)
Spermatozoon penetrating zona pellucida (done be connecting via a receptor and then digesting)
Fusion of cell membrane of spermatozoon and oocyte --> Zona reaction
Spermatozoon into oocyte
Formation of male and female pronuclei
Fusion of pronuclei
Zygote (first cleavage division occurs immediately)

Where does fertilisation occur::In the uterine tube

How long does the zygote remain in the uterine tube::5 days

Describe the development inside the zona pellucida
?
Ootid undergoes syngamy to become a zygote
Then become 2 daughters (blastomeres)
2 --> 4 --> 8 --> Morula

Describe the composition of the morula
?
One homogenous cell population
The outer cell layer becomes more compacted and forms tight junctions
Inner cells form gap junctions

Describe the composition of the early blastocyst
?
Outer cells become quite compacted and have sodium pumps to release sodium inside the embryo which brings water inside
Fluid-filled compartment

When does the zygote enter the uterus::Either late morula or early blastocyst stage

Describe the hatching of the blastocyst
?
Trophoblast cells are pumping full of sodium which brings in water
Trophoblasts also produce proteolytic enzymes which will weaken the zona pellucida
Blastocyst begins to pulse, contracting and expanding
These all combine to weaken the zona pellucida eventually leading to the hatching of the blastocyst

Outline what occurs after blastocyte hatching
?
No more zona pellucida means rapid growth
4 mm to 25 cm in 4 days in cow
2mm to 20cm in 1-2 days in pig
Stays spherical and doesn't grow as rapidly in horses because of glycoprotein coating
The majority of this growth is the extra-embryonic membranes

What is the general timing of pre-attachment embryogenesis
?
2-cell in 24 hours
3-7 hours in the dog but stops
Queen forms morula after 5 days

What are the types of twin
?
Mono vs dizygotic
Digzygotic (dervied from 2 zygotes)
2 ovulations led to 2 oocytes ready for fertilisation by 2 different sperm cells
Hereditary basis
Monozygotic (derived from a single zygote)
- 2 blastocytes developing in zona pellucida
- 2 inner cell masses
- During the hatching split of the conceptus
Depending on whether the species is good or bad,
- Sheep is good (More offspring)
- Cows is kinda bad (risk of sterile females, more birth risks, extra energy requirements, more foetal membrane retained)
- Horses is bad (Not enough space in equine uterus, can't make it to term, both tend to be smaller, high risk of neither surviving, squeeze one to get rid of a twin using hand or ultrasound probe)

Outline the concepts of litres::Usually, each litter mate originates from a separate ovulation (multizygotic x-tuplets)
