# C2S - L16 - The Synapse and Graded Potentials

What is the name of the space between the two neurons::synapse

What are the two types of synapses
?
Chemical synapse: most common, transmission done by neurotransmitter
Electrical synapse: only recently being recognized in animals, the retina of the eye, is handled by gap junctions which allow electrical conductivity

Describe the structure of the chemical synapse
?
The synaptic knob is the enlarged presynaptic axon terminal
Inside synaptic vesicles are specific neurotransmitters that are synthesised and stored by the neuron
The gap between the pre and post-synaptic neurons is called the synaptic cleft
On the post-synaptic neuron is a subsynaptic membrane that has receptors for neurotransmitters and chemically gated receptor channels for $Na^+$, $K^+$, $Cl^-$

Describe the process of transmission across the synapse
?
1. Axon brings action potential into the synaptic knob
2. Action potential causes voltage-gated $Ca^{++}$ channels to open
3. Entrance of calcium ($Ca^{++}$) causes the release of neurotransmitters via exocytosis
4. Neurotransmitters diffuse across the synaptic cleft to bind to receptors on the subsynaptic membrane
5. Binding on the subsynaptic membrane causes chemically gated receptor channels to open propagating the action potential

T/F signal transfer at the synapse is bidirectional::False, signal transfer at the synapse is unidirectional going from the presynaptic to the postsynaptic neuron

Provide a summary of the chemical synapse
?
Neuron to neuron communication
Presynaptic neuron stimulates the postsynaptic neuron
Synaptic delay 0.5 to 1.0 milliseconds

Name 6 classical neurotransmitters and 6 neuropeptides
?
Classical neurotransmitters:
- Acetylcholine
- Dopamine
- Norepinephrine (noradrenaline)
- Epinephrine (adrenaline)
- Serotonin
- Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)
Neuropeptides
- Vasoactive intestinal peptide VIP
- Cholecystokinin, Enkephalin
- Somatostatin, Enkephalin, Neurotensin
- Enkephalin
- Substance P
- Thyrotropin-releasing hormone

What happens if neurotransmitters are not removed from the synapse::Action potentials will continue to be fired

What can remove a neurotransmitter::moved away by diffusion or broken down by specific enzymes and then taken up by neurons where the products can be recycled?

Where is the neurotransmitter acetylcholine used?
?
A cholinergic synapse
Receptors in the postsynaptic neuron:
Nicotinic: increases $Na^+$ permeability drives membrane closer to the threshold
Muscarinic:
- M1 decreases $K^+$ permeability drives membrane closet to the threshold (exocrine glands)
- M2 increases $K^+$ permeability drives the membrane further from the threshold (Heart)

What are graded potentials
?
Potentials that fade away as sodium diffuses back out of the axon
They are greatest at the point of origin and get weaker as they move away from the site
A single graded potential is often not enough to cause the propagation of an action potential but graded potentials can be added together to reach the threshold to generate an action potential

What are the ways in which graded potentials can be added
?
Temporal summation: If two or more signals come in at quick succession they can add together and initiate an action potential. These come from the SAME axon.
Spatial summation: If signals come in from two or more axons, they can add together to reach the threshold. Note that this is from two DIFFERENT axons.

What are the two types of synapses and what do they do
?
Excitatory: brings closer to action potential
Inhibitory: brings further away from action potential

T/F Inhibitory synapses depolarize the neuron::False, inhibitory synapses polarize the neuron and excitatory synapses depolarize the neuron

Give an example of a receptor that would cause excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSP) and the neurotransmitter that it would use
?
Acetylcholine would be released from the presynaptic neuron
This binds to acetylcholine-gated sodium channels which cause an influx of sodium into the cell, depolarizing it

Give an example of a receptor that would cause inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP) and the neurotransmitter that it would use
?
Ligand-gated chloride ion channels would cause chloride to enter the cell further polarizing it and moving it further away from an action potential

Describe the tetanus toxin (tetanospasmin) and how it functions
?
Binds to the presynaptic membrane and blocks the release of inhibitory neurotransmitters (GABA and glycine)
The excitatory signals in the postsynaptic neurons are unchecked
Uncontrolled muscle contractions and spasms
Lockjaw
