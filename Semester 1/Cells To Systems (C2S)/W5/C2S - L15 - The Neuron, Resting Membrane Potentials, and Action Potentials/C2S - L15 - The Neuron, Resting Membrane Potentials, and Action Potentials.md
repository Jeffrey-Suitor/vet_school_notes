# C2S - L15 - The Neuron, Resting Membrane Potentials, and Action Potentials

## Intended Learning Outcomes
- Understand the ionic basis of resting membrane potentials
- Understand the ionic basis for action potentials
- Explain how action potentials are generated and propagated along nerve fibres
- Understand how threshold and refractory period relate to neuron function

## Neurons
What are the two types of neurons and how are they classified
?
Sensory or afferent neurons carry information to the brain
Motor neurons or efferent neurons carry information from the brain

What is the resting membrane potential::-70 mV

What is a membrane potential::A difference in electrical potential caused by hydrogen ions across a cell membrane? If they were equal it would be a neutral state and if they are not equal they are polarised.

T/F the entire ECF is positively charged::False, the separated charges only accumulate along the cell membrane but the rest of the fluid is neutral

Where is the concentration of $Na^+$, $K^+$, and $A^-$ higher; intracellular fluid or extracellular fluid
?
$Na^+$: extracellular
$K^+$: intracellular
$A^-$: extracellular

T/F potassium wants to enter the cell during an action potential::False, potassium wants to leave the cell, sodium wants to enter the cell

How many more times permeable is potassium compared to sodium for the cell membrane::25-30

What is the ratio of the sodium-potassium pump::3 sodiums leave the cell and 2 potassiums enter, 1 ATP is used

Why is the increased permeability of potassium important::The increased permeability allows for the simple diffusion of potassium out of the cell which makes the inside more negatively charged and attracts potassium back into the cell

When will the equilibrium potential occur::When the chemical force of the potassium concentration gradient is equal to the opposing electrical force

T/F the concentration gradients of sodium and potassium are occurring at the same time::True, but sodium is more permeable which allows it to diffuse more readily out of the cell.

What is the electrochemical equilibrium for sodium and potassium and the resting membrane potential?
?
Sodium = +60 mv
Potassium = -90 mv
Resting membrane potential = -70 mV

T/F Chloride ($Cl^-$)does not contribute to the resting membrane potential::True, this is because the resting potential of chloride is also about -70 mV and is not crossing the plasma membrane when the cell is at rest

What is an action potential::A rapid transient change in the membrane potential (electrical activity) of the cell membrane, sudden, rapid, all or non-event, uniform amplitude

Describe the shape of the membrane potential during an action potential
?
1. Stimulus causes the slow depolarization effect
2. If the threshold potential (-50mV) is reached, depolarization occurs, else nothing
3. Depolarization reaches about +30mV before repolarization begins
4. Repolarization will go below -70 mV leading to hyperpolarization
5. The hyperpolarized cell will return to the resting potential
The entire process of depolarization to hyperpolarization takes about 1 millisecond

If an action potential stimulus increases in size will the action potential increase in size::No it will not, once the threshold value has been crossed all suprathreshold stimuli will reach the same level

What are the 5 stages of action potentials?
?
1. Resting potential
2. Slow depolarization
3. Rapid depolarisation
4. Reploarisation
5. Hyperpolarization

Outline the membrane resting potential state
?
More sodium outside the cell
Potassium is about 25 to 30 times more permeable, more potassium inside cell
The cell is at -70mV resting potential
Voltage-gated ion channels are closed, but there may be passive movement of potassium

Outline the membrane's slow polarisation state
?
The stimulus causes a slow increase in positive charge inside the cell
Some voltage-gated sodium channels are open allowing sodium to slowly enter the cell, thereby increasing the positive charge

Outline the depolarization state of the action potential
?
If a sufficient positive charge has occurred within the cell and the threshold is crossed, depolarisation occurs
Explosive increase of positive charge within the cell
Once depolarization is reached the membrane becomes 600 times more permeable to sodium than to potassium due to the opening of voltage-gated sodium channels

Outline the state of repolarization in the action potential
?
Sodium voltage-gated channels close
Potassium-gated channels close
The cell interior becomes more negative due to $K^+$ leaving the cell

Outline the state of hyperpolarization in the action potential
?
The voltage-gated $K^+$ channels close slowly causing hyperpolarisation of the membrane prior to returning to resting membrane potential by the sodium-potassium pump

What does the sodium-potassium pump use to move ions against their concentration gradient::ATP

What is the state of the sodium and potassium-gated channels throughout the action potential
?
1. Resting potential: Sodium (activation gate closed, inactivation gate open), Potassium (activation gate closed)
2. Threshold potential: Sodium (activation gate opens, inactivation gate already open), Potassium (activation gate closed)
3. Peak: Sodium (activation gate still open; inactivation gate closes), Potassium (activation gate opens)
4. Hyperpolarization: Sodium (activation gate closes, inactivation gate opens), Potassium (activation gate closes)
5. Resting potential: The sodium-potassium pump will restore back to resting potential

Describe how the structure of the axon allows it to propagate electron potentials
?
Axon hillock has a lower threshold than other areas of the neuron and more sodium channels thereby making it usually the trigger zone where action potential initiated
1. Input zone (dendrites) receives incoming signals from other neurons.
2. Trigger zone (axon hillock) initiates action potentials down the axon
3. Conducting zones (axon) conduct potentials in an undiminishing fashion, often over long distances
4. Output zones (axon terminals) release a neurotransmitter that influences other cells

What causes the axon to flow in one direction::Refractory period

What is the refractory period
?
The minimum time during which the neuron is unresponsive to further stimulation
1st phase is called the absolute refractory period: Voltage-gated $Na^+$ channels have become inactivated and are incapable of being opened until resting membrane potential is reached
2nd phase called the relative refractory period: Some but not all $Na^+$ channels are responsive to further stimulus and are capable of being partially opened

When do the absolute and relative refractory periods occur::Absolute = depolarization, relative = repolarization

Provide an overview of how an action potential is propagated
?
Unidirectional electrical flow (one-way)
Constant stimulus strength (self-perpetuating)
Signals can be passed on to other neurons and effector organs (muscles, glands)

What are the two factors that determine the velocity of action potentials::size of the axon, presence of myelin sheath

Why do action potentials travel faster in large axons compared to small axons::reduced resistance

Why does myelination allow for faster action potentials::myelin insulates the axon rapid transmission across the myelin sheath to the node of Ranvier allowing for faster propagation, "jumps" myelin sheath, also known as saltatory function

What cells create the myelin sheath::Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system and oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system

What is the myelin sheath made of::Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system and oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system

What are the gaps between myelin sheaths called::node of Ranvier

T/F each sensory receptor is designed to respond to one type of stimulus::True

How do sensory receptors work for creating signals in a specialized afferent ending
?
Stimulus is received
Stimulus-sensitive nonspecific cation channel can be a mechanically gated sodium channel that causes an influx of sodium into the cell
Depolarization occurs and if the threshold level is reached causing voltage-gated sodium channels to open creates an action potential

How do sensory receptors work for creating signals in separate receptor cells
1. Stimulus-sensitive nonspecific cation channel opens allowing an influx of sodium
2. This causes voltage-gated calcium channels to open
3. This releases a neurotransmitter from a vesicle into the synapse the cell and afferent neuron
4. Neurotransmitter will being to a chemically gated receptor channel on an afferent neuron fibre
5. This binding will cause an influx of sodium which will open the voltage-gated sodium channels
6. Voltage-gated sodium channels trigger an action potential

Where is the trigger zone in afferent vs efferent neurons
?
Afferent: the first node of Ranvier is the trigger zone
Efferent: Axon hillock is the trigger zone

What is a Pacinian receptor
?
Measures change in pressure and vibration in the skin
Surrounded by concentric layers of connective tissue
Connective tissue responds to pressure or vibration when skin is touched

How is the Pacinian receptor stimulation
?
Mechanically gated sodium channels
Closed when no pressure is applied
When there is compression these channels will open allowing sodium in, depolarizing and if sufficient will trigger an action potential at the first node of Ranvier.

How can the intensity of a signal be indicated by a sensory neuron?
?
The more intense stimulus will result in a great signal at the sensory receptor which will increase the frequency of action potentials in afferent fibre. This increased frequency will increase the rate of neurotransmitter release at afferent terminals

T/F There is no refractory period in sensory neurons::True, this allows them to be stimulated as many times as possible and still get an action potential

T/F The intensity of the stimulus is directly proportional to the frequency of action potential. :: True, a stronger stimulus generates greater receptor potential which is then transduced into more impulses of APs per second
