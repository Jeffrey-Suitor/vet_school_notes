# C2S - L18 - Contraction of cardiac and smooth muscle

## Intended Learning Outcomes
- Describe the levels of organization of skeletal muscle and the differences in skeletal muscle fibre types.
- Explain the sliding filament mechanism of muscle contraction and the role Ca++ plays in contracting smooth and skeletal muscle.
- Explain how cross-bridge power strokes bring about shortening of muscle fibres and the utilisation of ATP during cross-bridge power strokes.
-   Describe the various control mechanisms of smooth muscle contraction.

## Contraction of Cardiac Muscle

Compare and contrast skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle
?
Similar: contractile force generated by the sarcomere, the role of calcium
Different: Not initiated by neuronal input, all cells are electrically coupled, long action potential

T/F Cardiac muscle cells require input from the nervous system to contract::False

What is the nervous system which innervates cardiac muscle::Autonomic

Describe the structure of the cardiac muscle
?
Mononucleated muscle cells
Relatively short fibres
Branching and interdigitate
Arranged in series and parallel
Z lines, M lines, A bands, and I bands are present

What is an intercalated disk
?
Two distinct regions
Transverse portions, aligned with Z line, desmosomes, mechanical cohesion
The lateral portion, parallel to myofilaments, is rich in gap junctions, low resistance pathways

What are the 3 types of heart muscle cells
?
Cells of myocardium
Rhythmically active self-excitatory "pacemaker" cells
Purkinje fibres, specialised in conducting pathways that enhance the spread of localised excitation

Describe the excitation-contraction coupling in cardiac muscle cells
?
Action potential spreads along the plasma membrane and invades T tubules
This opens voltage-gated calcium channels in the T tubule membrane
Diffusion of extracellular calcium
Extracellular calcium stimulates the release of calcium into the sarcoplasmic reticulum
Results in contraction (systole)
Strength of contraction dependent on the presence and concentration of extracellular calcium

What influences the force of cardiac muscle contractility
?
Calcium levels
Hormones (epinephrine)
Nervous (autonomic)
Extent of stretch
Cardiac muscle operates in a range of lengths shorter than optimal
Always contracts with maximum force no matter the length

Outline smooth muscle contraction
?
Contraction is mediated by actin and myosin cross-bridge cycling
undefined sarcomere structure
Cells are bound together by a basement membrane and transmit force
Lack T-tubules
- Small membrane invaginations called caveoli
- The sarcoplasmic reticulum is rudimentary

What are dense bodies?
?
Actin filaments attached to dense bodies
Dense bodies are attached to the membrane
Linked by a diagonal network of intermediate filaments (desmin)

Describe the structure of smooth muscle actin and myosin
?
Thick filaments: myosin
Thin filaments: Actin, tropomyosin, calmodulin, NO troponin
Myosin heads along the entire length (not ends like in cardiac and skeletal muscle)

Describe the process of excitation-contraction coupling in multi-unit smooth muscle
?
Individual cells
Discrete innervation: individual activity
Few gap junctions
Poor response to stretch
Minimal response to hormones
Ciliary muscle of the eye, large airways in the lungs

Describe the process of excitation-contraction coupling in multi-unit smooth muscle
?
Visceral (function not anatomy)
Network of closely apposed cells acting as a single unit
Direct stimulation of only a few
Multiple adherence points (desmosomes)
linked electrically by gap junctions
Respond to:
- Neural signals
- Hormones
- Mechanical stretch
- Local "pacemaker" potentials
Muscles of the uterus, intestinal tract, bile duct, small blood vessels

What are the three types of innervation for smooth muscle cells
?
Extrinsic: both sympathetic and parasympathetic
Intrinsic: short neurons forming plexuses (networks) with tissue
Afferent sensory: autonomic reflexesa

Describe the innervation of smooth muscle cells
?
No neuromuscular junction
Branching of fibres within "varicosities" that contains vesicles with neurotransmitter (both acetylcholine and norepinephrine)
Neurotransmitter is released into interstitial fluid and then diffuses
Potential for both sympathetic and parasympathetic input
Modulatory rather than inducing

Outline non-neural activation of smooth muscle cells
?
Hormones can open and/or close ion channels changing membrane potential
Chemical stimuli can cause the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum without a change in membrane potential
Other influences: decreased oxygen, pH, body temperature

Compare and contrast the role of calcium in smooth muscle and skeletal muscle
?
Same: Calcium regulates cross-bridge formation and thus cycling
Different: Control of calcium levels, influence on cross-bridge formation (myosin)

How can calcium enter the cytosol of smooth muscle cells:receptor-mediated, or membrane potential dependent

How does calcium cross-bridge regulation work in smooth muscle
?
Smooth muscle lacks troponin
Cross-bridge binding modulated by calcium is dependent on the phosphorylation of myosin
Calcium binds to calmodulin which then binds to a myosin light chain kinase
The light chain kinase phosphorylates myosin allowing it to bind
Unphosphorylated myosin cannot bind

Compare the process of calcium binding and cross-bridging of smooth muscle and skeletal muscle using a table
