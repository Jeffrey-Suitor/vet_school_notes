# C2S - L19 - Spinal reflex control of skeletal muscle contraction

## Intended Learning Outcomes
- Describe the different types of lower motor neurons that contribute to reflex arcs.
- Describe the structure and function of intra- and extrafusal muscle fibres.
- Describe the structure and function of muscle spindles and Golgi tendon organs.
- Explain how a reflex arc works.

## Reflex Control of Muscle Activity

Outline muscle proprioception and the proprioceptors involved
?
Muscles spindles and the Golgi tendon organs provide afferent information essential for controlling muscle activity
Proprioceptors in muscle:
- Golgi Tendon Organs
  - Present in tendons
  - Report muscle tension (contraction) development
- Muscle spindles
  - Embedded within muscle
  - Report muscle position, "Stretch"

What are the two ways in which muscle proprioception information is used
?
Appraisal of motor areas of the brain about muscle length and tension
Control of muscle length and tension in a negative feedback fashion by means of local spinal reflexes

What two ways are motor neurons influenced
?
Local reflex circuitry
Descending pathways from the brain stem and cerebral cortex

Outline a simple reflex in a muscle
?
1. Sensor (receptor): muscle spindles or Golgi tendons
2. Afferent arm (input): transfer the message from the receptor to the central nervous system
3. Integration centre (interneuron): where interneurons transfer messages to efferent arm
4. Efferent arm (output): neurons that take the message to the effector organ
5. Effector organ (response element): in a simple reflex this would be the muscle

What is an interneuron?
?
Most descending synaptic input does not go directly to motor neurons
Synapse with interneurons which synapse with motor neurons
90% of spinal cord neurons
Integrate input from higher centres, peripheral receptors and other interneurons

Outline the local afferent input
?
Afferent fibres carry information from receptors in three sources:
1. In skeletal muscles controlled by motor neurons (Golgi tendon, muscle spindle)
2. In other nearby muscles, especially antagonists (Bicep vs. Tricep)
3. In the tendons, joints, and skin of body parts affected by muscle action

What are the 3 sources from which afferent muscle fibres carry information?
?
1. In skeletal muscles controlled by motor neurons (Golgi tendon, muscle spindle)
2. In other nearby muscles, especially antagonists (Bicep vs. Tricep)
3. In the tendons, joints, and skin of body parts affected by muscle action

How do we identify muscle spindles on histology?
?
Transverse section through the entire muscle belly
Surrounded by connective tissue capsule
Intrafusal muscle fibres do not contribute to muscle tension although they will contract. They contract to maintain position relative to muscle fibres so that they can sense how the muscle fibres are being sensed

Provide an overview of the muscle spindle
?
Located within the fleshy part of the muscle
Intrafusal fibres parallel to extrafusal fibres
The noncontractile central portion (nuclear band)
Detects:
- Rate of change at which the muscle fibres are stretched
- Changes in the length of muscle fibres
Aids in coordination and efficiency of muscle contraction

T/F the nuclear band of the muscle spindle is striated::False

What are the types of nerve fibres found in the muscle spindle
?
Nuclear bag fibres:
- A large number of nuclei packed into mid-portion
- Sense onset of stretch
Nuclear chain fibres
- Nuclei in a longitudinal row
- Sense sustained stretch
Both are activated with rapid stretch

T/F The nuclear bag fibres in the muscle spindle are activated with a rapid stretch while the nuclear chain fibres are activated by a slow stretch::False, both are activated by a fast stretch

T/F nuclear bag fibres sense sustained stretch::False, they sense the onset of stretch

What are the two types of motor neurons in the intrafusal fibres?
?
The efferent neuron which innervates intrafusal fibres = gamma ($\gamma$) motor neuron
The efferent neuron which innervates extrafusal fibres = alpha ($\alpha$) motor neuron

Outline the orientation of fibres inside the intrafusal fibres
?
Muscle spindles are attached by connective tissue in parallel to the extrafusal fibres
External force stretching the muscle also stretches the intrafusal fibres activating their receptor endings

Outline the co-activation of $\gamma$ and $\alpha$ motor neurons::
?
When a muscle is stretched both the intrafusal and extrafusal fibres are stretched
Intrafusal fibres do not contribute to muscle tension
The more or the faster the muscle is stretched, the greater the rate of receptor firing

Describe the stretch reflex in regard to the muscle fibres and nerve innervation
?
Striking of the patellar ligament causes a sudden stretch in the quadriceps
The sudden stretch of muscle results in:
1. Muscles spindles detect stretch of the muscle
2. Sensory neurons conduct action potentials to the spinal cord
3. Sensory neurons synapse directly with alpha motor neurons
4. Alpha motor neurons conduct action potentials to the muscle, causing it to contract and resist being stretched
Only reflex which synapses directly with a motor neuron
Similar things happen when a quick change in body posture is made
There is a reciprocal innervation of the hamstrings during the stretch reflex to cause them to relax

What muscles are involved in the stretch reflex (patellar reflex, knee jerk)
?
The patellar ligament was struck with a patellar hammer
This pulls on the quadriceps muscle causing a sudden stretch

Provide an overview of the stretch reflex
?
The stretch, or myotactic reflex
Produces rapid corrections of motor output in the moment-to-moment control of movement
Forms the basis for postural reflexes to maintain body position

What are the Golgi tendon organs
?
Located at the junction of tendon and muscle
Detects:
- The force of muscle contraction
- Tension applied to the tendon
- Protects tendons and muscles from excessive tension
- A large diameter myelinated type 1 b axons arise from each GTO
- Muscle contraction stretches the GTO and generates AP
- Greater the force of contraction higher the firing rate

Describe the tendon reflex
?
1. Increase tension stimulates sensory receptor (tendon)
2. Sensory Neuron excited
3. Within the integrating centre (spinal cord) sensory neuron actives inhibitory interneuron
4. Motor neuron to antagonistic muscles is excited
5. Motor neuron inhibited
6. Effector (muscle attached to the same tendon) relaxes and relives excess tension
Prevents damage to the muscle due to excessive tension by alleviating the tension
