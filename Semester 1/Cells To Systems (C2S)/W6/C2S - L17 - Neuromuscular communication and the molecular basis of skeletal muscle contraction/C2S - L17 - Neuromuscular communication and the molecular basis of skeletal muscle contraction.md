# C2S - L17 - Neuromuscular communication and the molecular basis of skeletal muscle contraction

## Intended Learning Outcomes
- Describe the neuromuscular junction.
- Describe differences between neuron connections between smooth muscle and skeletal muscle.
- Describe motor units and their recruitment for varying strengths of contraction.

## Neuromuscular Junction

What is the neuromuscular junction?
?
The junction at which a nerve terminates on a muscle fibre
Motor neurons have large axons that are normally myelinated
Nerve fibres enlarge into a node near the plasma membrane
Nerves are not directly attached to muscle fibres
Connects at a motor end plate which is a specialised enlarged synapse with the cell membrane of the skeletal muscle fibre
Unique to skeletal muscle fibres and doesn't apply to smooth or cardiac muscle

T/F Nerves are directly attached to muscle fibres::False, it connects at a motor end plate which is a specialised enlarged synapse with the cell membrane of the skeletal muscle fibre

T/F Neuromuscular junctions are unique to skeletal muscle fibres::True

What are the key features of the neuromuscular junction
?
Motor neuron axon with axon branches
Motor neuron
Motor neuron end plate
Synaptic cleft
Synaptic vesicles
Neurotransmitters

What is a motor unit::A motor unit is a single motor neuron and all muscle fibres are controlled by the motor neuron

T/F the density of motor units determines the granularity of contractions that can be performed

What is the role of a muscle with many small motor units::Fine grained motion?

What is the role of a muscle with few large motor units::Generating large forces of contraction?

Describe the stimulus used in the contraction of muscle fibres
?
The nerve impulse causes the opening of voltage-gated calcium channels.
The influx of calcium causes the release of the neurotransmitters acetylcholine (ACh) from synaptic vesicles
Ach crosses the synapse cleft and binds to ACh receptors on the motor end plate
Generates a muscle impulse caused by the opening of sodium channels
Muscle impulse eventually reaches the sarcoplasmic reticulum and the cisternae

Describe the structure of the skeletal muscle fibres
?
Sarcolemma: plasma membrane of the sarcomere
Sarcoplasm: cytoplasm of the sarcomere
Sarcoplasmic reticulum: Sac-like organelles that contain calcium 
Transverse (T) tubule: Extension of the plasma membrane into sarcoplasm where they lay very close to the cisterns of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This enables the action potential to be transmitted to the sarcoplasmic reticulum from the sarcolemma leading to the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)
Triad:
- Cisternae of SR
- T tubule
Myofibril
Action myofilaments
Myosin myofilaments
Sarcomere

What are the areas of the sarcomere
?
I band: thin filaments
A band: thick + thin filaments
H zone: thick filaments
Z line: separates thin filaments
M line: separates thick filaments

What are the two types of myofilaments::myosin and actin

Describe the structure of the thick myofilaments
?
Myosin
Thick filaments 
Composed of myosin protein
Form the cross-bridges
2 subunits and form a golf club shape
Each subunit has a tail, hinge, head
The tails are intertwined
There are two binding sites at the head, the actin-binding site, and the myosin ATPase site
ATPase site, ATP is hydrolysed to ADP and phosphate by ATPase releasing energy for contraction

Describe the structure of the thin myofilaments
?
Actin
Thin filaments 
Composed of actin protein
Associated with troponin and tropomyosin proteins
Actin molecules are globular shaped and arranged in chains, intertwined together, 
Has a myosin-binding site for the binding of the cross-bridge during contraction
In a relaxed state, the actin-binding site is covered by tropomyosin
Tropomyosin has bound troponin and when calcium binds to troponin it exposes the myosin-binding sites by moving the tropomyosin

T/F the cross bridges extend from the thin to the thick myofilaments::False, they extend thick to thin

What is the role of troponin and tropomyosin in the regulation of the muscle contraction::tropomyosin covers the myosin binding sites on the acting and troponin when exposed to calcium will cause tropomyosin to change shape revealing the myosin binding sites

Describe the process of excitation-contraction coupling in muscle cells.
?
Muscle impulses cause the SR to release calcium ions into the cytosol
Calcium binds to troponin to change its shape
The position of tropomyosin is altered
Binding sites on actin are now exposed
Actin and myosin molecules bind via myosin cross-bridges

T/F the release of ATP causes the cross bridge to dissociate from actin::False, the binding of ATP causes the cross bridge to dissociate

What are the 3 roles of calcium in muscle contraction
?
Calcium causes the release of ACh at the synapse
Calcium causes the exposure of myosin binding sites on actin by binding to troponin which moves tropomyosin
Calcium is pumped back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum for muscle relaxation

Describe the sliding filament model
?
When sarcomeres shorten, thick and thin filaments slide past one another
H zones and I bands narrow
Z lines move closer together

Describe the process of cross-bridge cycling
?
Myosin cross-bridges attach to the actin-binding site
Myosin cross-bridge pull thing filament
ADP and phosphate released from myosin
New ATP binds to myosin
The linkage between actin and myosin cross-bridge breaks
ATP splits
Myosin cross-bridges go back to their original position
ATP splits

What is the cause of rigour mortis::No more ATP to break the cross bridge leading to muscle flexion and stiffening.

Describe the process of muscle relaxation
?
Acetylcholinesterase rapidly decomposes ACh remaining in the synapse
Muscle impulse stops
Stimulus to the sarcolemma and muscle fibre membrane ceases
Calcium moves back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) by SERCA (sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase pump)
Myosin and actin-binding prevented
Muscle fibres relax

How do we return a muscle contraction
?
Twitch: 
- Latent period: Time before the contraction occurs
- Period of contraction: Time to reach maximum contraction
- Period of relaxation: Time to return to baseline
Refractory period: Time until the next twitch can occur
All or no response

Outline the length-tension relationship in muscles::If muscle is too shortened or too stretched the muscle will not be able to create the same degree of force

Describe the process of summation of twitches
?
The process by which individual twitches combine
Produces sustained contractions
This can lead to tetanic contractions

What is a tetanic contraction::Sustained maximum muscle contraction until the stimulus is removed or fatigue begins to set in

Outline the recruitment of motor units
?
Recruitment increases the number of motor units activated for contraction
Whole muscles are composed of many motor units
More precise movements are produced with fever muscle fibres within a motor unit
As the intensity of stimulation increases, recruitment of motor units continues until all motor units are activated
Type 1 slow oxidative fibres-> Type 2A fast oxidative fibres -> Type 2B fast glycolytic

What are the 3 types of muscle fibres and what is their contraction length and strength::
Type 1 slow oxidative fibres: Sustained contraction but weak contractions
Type 2A fast oxidative fibres: Medium contraction length with medium strength
Type 2B fast glycolytic: Short powerful contractions

Outline how contractions are sustained and why certain sizes of motor units are recruited first
?
Smaller motor units (smaller diameter axon) recruited first
Larger motor units (larger diameter axons) recruited later
Produces smooth movements

What are the 3 types of muscle fibres and describe each
?
Slow oxidative (Type 1):
- Always oxidative
- Resistant to fatigue
- Red fibers
- Most myoglobin
- Good blood supply
Fast oxidative fibers (Type 2A):
- Intermediate fibers
- Oxidative
- An intermediate amount of myoglobin
- Pink to red in colour
- Susceptible to fatigue
Fast glycolytic fibres (Type 2 B)
- White fibres (less myoglobin)
- Poorer blood supply
- Susceptible to fatigue
