## Management of Shelters

103057 were received by the RSPCA nationally in 2020-2021
**Animals come from 3 sources: Stray, Surrender, Rescue**
Many have unknown or poor healthcare histories

How can health shelters can transmit disease
?
1. A source of infection sufficient to cause disease (pathogen)
2. A susceptible host
3. A mode of transmission of the infection to another host for the disease to continue
  1. Direct transmission
  2. Indirect transmission (also known as fomite transmission)
  3. Droplet transmission
  4. Airborne transmission
  5. Vector transmission (mosquito or rodent)

What are the 3 main aims of infectious disease control programs?
?
1. Minimize host susceptibility: nutrition, pain control, avoiding overcrowding, limiting stress
2. Optimize every animal's ability to resist disease: vaccinate and worm every animal on entry
3. Decrease the likelihood of exposure to problem pathogens
  1. Facility design
  2. Animal and staff flow through the shelter
  3. Properly communicated protocols (for cleaning and workflow)

What are some important facility design considerations?
?
Cats and dogs are kept separate whenever possible in all areas of the shelter. Each area should have its own equipment and food preparation area
- Initial assessment area
- Quarantine - healthy animals admitted must be quarantined for 8 days
- Isolation - animals showing clinical signs consistent with infectious disease
- Separate housing area for animals cleared from quarantine i.e. those awaiting adoption
- Adoption area

Outline the procedures for human and animal flow in a shelter
?
Separate entry for those arriving with animals entering the facility and those entering looking to adopt
Clear protocols for workflow and standards of work required e.g. description of how cleaning must be done
PPE for those working with isolated animals
Carers always examine healthy animals before those in quarantine and isolation
Excellent staff training

What are some problem diseases in small animal shelters
?
Cats - feline respiratory disease (cat flu). In some cases will carry the virus for the rest of their lives
Dogs - parvo, canine (kennel) cough. Less common - canine coronavirus, Giardia
Zoonoses:
- Ringworm - a fungal infection
- Giardia - GI parasitic disease
- Cat scratch disease - a bacterial disease caused by Bartonella henselae
- Intestinal worms - roundworm, hookworm, tapeworm
- Bacterial diseases - salmonella, campylobacter 
- Toxoplasmosis - a particular problem for pregnant women
