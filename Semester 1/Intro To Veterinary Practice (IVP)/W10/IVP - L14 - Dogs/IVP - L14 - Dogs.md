## Welfare Needs of Dogs and Puppies

Outline welfare needs in the environment for dogs
?
On a bed where they can rest undisturbed
Poisonous or hazardous items stored safely out of reach
Safe vehicular travel - best travelling on someone's lap on the very first trip home. In the longer term, familiarise yourself with a crate or travel harness
Secure housing

Outline the puppy welfare needs
?
Ideally fed commercial puppy diet as their requirements for a number of key nutrients are different from adults
| Nutrient   | Puppy | Adult |
| ---------- | ----- | ----- |
| Protein    | 22    | 18    |
| Fat        | 8     | 5     |
| Calcium    | 1     | 0.6   |
| Phosphorus | 0.8   | 0.5   |
Can change to an adult diet when they are about 80% of adult size. The age varies between 9 months (very small breeds) and 16 months (large and giant breeds)
Commercial food gives a complete, balanced diet
Well-balanced home diets can be fed
Amount varies with lifestyle and health
Treats can be given e.g. for training but shouldn't be added to the diet

Outline raw food diets in dogs
?
Biologically Appropriate Raw Food (BARF)
Raw Meat Based Diet (RMBD)
Owners may not like or trust commercial food and want to feed their animals foods closer to what they would have eaten in the wild
Raw meat diets have become increasingly popular
Concerns:
- Is the diet nutritionally complete for the pet, especially growing animals
- Raw meat quite commonly has Salmonella

What are some food dogs should not eat
?
Onions
Chocolate
Coffee
Cooked bones
Fatty foods
Mouldy foods

Outline the exercise needs of puppies
?
Opinions vary on the amount of exercise is appropriate
One rule of thumb is 5 minutes per month of age until fully grown
need to familiarise them with harness/collar and lead walking
Should not be over-exercised, especially large-breed pups
Take care in public places until 10 days after the final vaccination

Outline the exercise needs of adult dogs
?
Out of the home or garden at least once daily
Off-lead time is important for mental and physical health
The amount of time needed depends on factors such as age and breed

Outline the coat care of dogs
?
Hair:
- Single coat
- Longer growth cycle
- More likely to trap allergens (Can f 1)
- Needs regular grooming
Fur:
- maybe a single or double coat
- Denser (more follicles per cm^2 than hair)
- Sheds more frequently
- Requires less grooming than hair

Outline toenail care in dogs
?
Clip toenails for dogs whose nails aren't being ground down
If you clip don't hit the quik
Silver nitrate to stop bleeding

## Health Needs Of Puppies and Dogs

What are the core vaccines for dogs?
?
Sometimes called C3 or DHP/DAP
Distemper - canine distemper virus (mostly GI signs)
Hepatitis - canine adenovirus type 1 (apathy, discharge from eyes)
Parvo - parvovirus (mostly GI signs)

What are the common non-core vaccines for dogs in South Australia
?
canine cough (kennel cough)
Canine parainfluenza virus *Bordetella bronchiseptica*
Most boarding kennels require dogs to have a C5 which is the core vaccine + kennel cough

Outline a primary vaccination protocol in SE Australia

Outline DHP/C3 vaccines differences
?
Can be annual or triennial
There are vaccines with different durations of immunity for distemper, hepatitis and parvovirus
Some require annual boosters Protech C3
Others are given triennially Nobivac DHP

Outline the respiratory vaccines in dogs
?
Vaccines for parainfluenza virus and *Bordetella bronchiseptica* MUST be given annually

Provide an adult vaccination protocol
?
| Time                                  | Vaccine                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 12 months after 3rd puppy vaccination | Distemper, Hepatitis, Parvovirus, Parainfluenza virus, _Bordetella bronchiseptica_ (C5) |
| 2 years old                           | Parainfluenza virus, *Bordetella bronchiseptica*                                        |

How should dogs whose vaccination history be treated
?
Dogs first vaccinated as adults or with an unknown vaccination status should be given 2 doses 4-6 weeks apart
Not considered fully protected until 10 days after the last dose, although they could potentially have naturally acquired immunity

Outline the many non-core vaccines for dogs
?
Many non-core vaccines are used in different parts of the world
Rabies is one of the most common and is a legal requirement in many places as a potentially fatal zoonotic disease
Leptospirosis is also commonly given across the world

Outline gastrointestinal parasites in dogs
?
**Roundworms are the greatest concern in young puppies as can be transferred in utero or in milk**
Diagnose by finding eggs or adults in faeces or presumptive diagnosis in pot-bellied puppies or kittens
**Roundworms** - clinical signs much more common in puppies. Encysted larvae long-term issue in breeding bitches
**Hookworms** - attach to the wall of SI and feed on blood. Diagnose by a faecal exam
**Whipworms** - attach to the wall of LI. Diagnose by finding eggs in faeces
**Tapeworms** - In urban areas, the most common species is Dipyllidium canium (flea tapeworm). Fleas act as an intermediate hosts. In rural areas, hydatid tapeworm is a common significant zoonosis

Outline parasite treatment in dogs
?
**A common intestinal worming protocol would be to treat every 2 weeks until 12 weeks, then monthly until 6 months, then 3 monthly for life.**
Up until 12 weeks, it is common to use a product that only treats intestinal worms and often in a syrup formulation as it is easier to dose a small puppy
At 2nd or 3rd vaccination, puppies often start on one of the combination parasiticides

Outline heartworm in dogs
?
Carried between dogs by mosquitoes so don't require contact with other dogs
Until the age of 6 months, puppies can be started on heartworm medication without being tested
Most common choices for preventative (annual injection, monthly oral or topical)
Animals that have not consistently been on prevention from puppyhood should be tested for heartworm before starting or resuming prevention

Outline fleas in dogs
?
The most significant problem with fleas in very young puppies is anaemia, also occasionally seen in adult dogs
Can be treated due to spon on, chew or tablet

What are the types of ticks in dogs
?
3 species of ticks found on dogs in Victoria
An important one currently is the paralysis tick (Ixodes holocyclus)
Brown dog ticks can carry Ehrlichia canis, a bacterium that can cause serious disease, Not yet been identified in Victoria
Prevention is much better than cure

Outline dental disease in dogs
?
3 years of age, 80% of dogs will have evidence of dental disease

## Reproduction in Dogs

Outline female dog reproduction
?
Start cycling from 6-15 months
2 heat periods (2 seasons) per year about 6 months apart with a long inter-oestrus
Large breeds may only cycle once a year
Season lasts 2-3 weeks vulval swelling +/0 discharge, increased urination
May have blood/straw-coloured vulval discharge for about 10 days

Outline pregnancy and weaning in dogs
?
Pregnancy lasts approximately 63 days
U/S from 3 weeks post-breeding is the best way to detect pregnancy and assess the viability of pups
A lateral abdominal radiograph is the best way to assess the number of puppies
Whelping often difficult in brachycephalic
Neonatal care is not covered here
Start weaning at 3-4 weeks: gradual introduction of milk replacer and solid puppy food
usually transition over 2-3 weeks

Outline desexing in female dogs
?
Surgery in Australia is almost always an ovariohysterectomy - removal of ovaries and uterus. Often done around 6 months but can be younger in the shelter setting
Increasingly recommended later desexing (3 months after first heat) as it affects more than breed ability e.g. growth plate closure, continence
3 main reasons to spay
- Prevention of pregnancy
- Prevention of pyometra
- Significantly reduced risk of mammary tumours if spayed early
If mature check she is not in season

Outline male reproduction in dogs
?
Can be sexually mature from around 5 months although more commonly 6-12 months
Have a bulbis glandis which swells during copulation, resulting in the copulatory tie

Outline castration in dogs
?
Surgery is an orchiectomy - removal of testes. Commonly done at about 6 months but some recommend waiting until 8 months when fully grown
Cryptorchid - one or both testes failed to descend. The retained testicle is significantly more likely to develop a testicular tumour than a descended testicle
Reasons to castrate:
- Prevention of unwanted offspring
- Prevention of testicular tumours
- Decrease in aggression and roaming
- Decrease in prostate and perianal tumours

When do we tattoo an animal::during desexing

What other procedures do we do during dog desexing::retained canines, hind dew claws, umbilical hernias

Outline microchipping in dogs:: done under the skin
