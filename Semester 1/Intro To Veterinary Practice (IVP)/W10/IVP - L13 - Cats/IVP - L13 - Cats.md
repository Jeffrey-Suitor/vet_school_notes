# IVP - L13 - Cats

## Cat breeds

What are the common cat breeds?
?
Domestic short hair (no real breed)
Domestic long hair (described by colour)

Explain coat colour and gender associations
?
Ginger cats are predominantly 75% male
Calicos and tortoiseshells are female
Male calico and tortoiseshells are often sterile
White cats with blue eyes are often deaf
Heterochromia means more likely to be deaf

Outline coat colour and health issues
?
Cats with non-pigmented ears and noses, regardless of the colour of the rest of the coat or eyes are at risk of auricular and nasal tumours, especially squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)

Classifying cats by body types
?
Oriental (thin with long limbs) Siamese
Foreign (thin, long limbs, smaller ears), Russian Blue
Standard DSH
Cobby (British Shorthair, Birman)
Large (Main Coon)

What are some structural features that can lead to discomfort or disease
?
Brachycephalic syndrome (Persian, British Shorthair, Scottish Fold)

What are some inherited conditions
?
Scottish Fold: Have a dominant gene mutation causing osteochondrodysplasia (OCD), which affects cartilage and bone development throughout the body The most visible result is the folded ears but other joints are affected resulting in painful arthritis

## Welfare Needs of Cats and Kittens

Welfare needs of cats at any age
?
Appropriate:
Environment
Diet
Exercise/enrichment/behaviour
Coat care

Outline indoor environments for cats
?
Somewhere comfortable to sleep and rest undisturbed
Places to climb and rest up high
Appropriate rea/s for core resources
Provision as many resources as the number of cats, plus one, position around the house so they aren't forced to share
Safe vehicular travel

Outline the outdoor environment for cats
?
In some areas, cats must be confined to the owner's property at all times
An increasing number of owners choose to confine their cats for the safety of both cat and local wildlife
Shouldn't be outside alone until 4-6 months and after they have been desexed if they do go out
Lead walking works well for some cats with access to a safe quiet place (backyard)

Outline the dietary needs of kittens
?
Ideally fed commercial kitten diet as their requirements of key nutrients are different from adults
Change to an adult diet when they are about one year of age
| Nutrient  | Kitten | Adult |
| --------- | ------ | ----- |
| protein   | 30     | 26    |
| fat       | 9      | 9     |
| Calcium   | 1      | 0.6   |
| Phosphorus | 0.8    | 0.5      |
An inappropriate diet can lead to significant issues such as pathological fractures

Outline the dietary needs of cats
?
Feed a complete commercial cat food
Cats must have taurine in their diet, ideally from meat
Only healthy treats are given occasionally, if at all
Raw meaty bones e.g. chicken necks
Calorie control for overweight
urinary care to prevent urinary crystals

What should cats not eat
?
Onion/garlic
Cooked bones
Chocolate
Grapes (fresh or dried)
Stones in stone fruit
Tomatoes
Anything with string/fishing line around it
Lilies (not really a food but toxic for cats)

Outline the exercise/enrichment/behaviour of kittens
?
Most active in the morning and evening
10-15 minutes of playtime
Incorporate normal chasing and pouncing behaviours
provide opportunities to climb
Don't allow them to bite as part of the play

Outline the exercise of cats
?
Suited to short bursts of energy
Indoor cats need opportunities for exercise and play

Outline coat care in cats
?
Not usually an issue
Shed twice a year
Shed in spring and autumn
Grooming loose hair can remove matting 
Older cats can't groom as well
Allergy to cats is cat dander, not cat hair, FD1
Twice as many cat allergies compared to dogs

## Health Needs of Cats and Kittens

What are the core vaccines for cats?
?
WSAVA - vaccines recommended worldwide for every animal
Core for all animals regardless of location, non-core for only certain areas
Feline panleukopaenia virus (FPV) - vomiting and diarrhoea. Transmission if faecal-oral
Feline herpesvirus 1 (FHV1) - upper respiratory infection
Feline calicivirus (FCV) - upper registry infection
Feline herpesvirus and feline calicivirus are 2 of the pathogens that are part of what is commonly called the 'cat flu' complex

What are the vaccination principles of cats
?
In general young animals will have 2-3 doses of vaccine in the primary sequence (because of the variation in blocking by maternally-derived antibody) then a booster 12 months
Animals are not protected until approximately 10 days after their last vaccination in their primary sequence of vaccines

What is the common primary sequence for felines?
?
| Timeline                    | Vaccines             |
| --------------------------- | -------------------- |
| 6-8 weeks                   | FPV, FHV-1, FCV (F3) |
| 12-14 weeks                 | FPV, FHV-1, FCV (F3) |
| 16-18 weeks                 | FPV, FHV-1, FCV (F3) |
| 12 months after 3rd vaccine | FPV, FHV-1, FCV (F3) | 

What are the core vaccines for Australian cats?
?
Annual and triennial vaccines
In Australia, there is no registered vaccine with a claim for three years duration of effect for animals in high-risk environments such as boarding catteries so F3 is generally given annually
An adult cat that had vaccinations as a kitten but has missed some yearly vaccinations only needs one booster
An adult cat with an unknown vaccination history should have 2 vaccines 2-4 weeks apart to stimulate an adequate immune response

Outline the non-core vaccines for kittens
?
Prevalence of diseases in the local area
The lifestyle of the kitten - indoor vs outdoor, breeding cattery
Risk of vaccine sarcoma
Chlamydophila felis
- Bacteria
- Causes ocular signs
- Can be combined with an F3 to make an F4
- Used in some clinics as a standard vaccine in Australia and elsewhere
Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV)
- Infection is transmitted through bite wounds
- Free-roaming, aggressive male cats are most at risk
- Inhibits the immune system from functioning normally
- The best prevention is stopping cats from getting bitten by an infected cat
- Vaccination protocol - primary series of 3 injections 2-4 weeks apart and annual boosters
- Issues with vaccine
  - Not fully protective (56%)
  - Some commercially FIV tests (SNAP) do not differentiate between antibodies from natural infection and those from vaccination
  - Risk of vaccine sarcoma as it contains an adjuvant

Outline gastrointestinal parasites
?
**Roundworms** - greatest concern in young kittens as can be transferred in milk. Diagnose by finding eggs or adults in faeces or presumptive diagnosis in pot-bellied kittens. The greatest concern in young kittens as can be transferred in utero or in milk
**Hookworms** - attach to the wall of SI and feed on blood
**Whipworms** - attach to the wall of LI
**Tapeworms** - may see segments in faeces
Cats should be treated every 2 weeks until 12 weeks, then monthly until 6 months, then 3 monthly for life. Some cats go onto combined parasiticides

Outline heartworm in cats
?
Can act as hosts in the same way as dogs but are more resistant to infection than dogs as their immune system reacts to the worms and far fewer develop heartworm disease
When infection does develop the signs are more related to the immune response and are often predominantly respiratory
Cats are much less commonly treated with heartworm preventatives than dogs

Outline fleas in cats
?
Heavy infestations can cause significant anaemia in small kittens
Look for adult fleas and flea dirt
Take care with treating very young kittens - most products can't be used before 8-10 weeks
In adults -scratching, hair loss, hot spots, near the hind of the cat
Must treat all animals in the house as well as the environment

Outline ticks in cats
?
Not commonly a problem in southern Victoria but more significant up the east coast
Same species of concern as dogs but clinical signs are slightly different
Prevent by checking for ticks and preventative medications
Preventatives for dogs are often toxic for cats so take care

Outline dental disease in cats
?
By 3 years of age, 70% of cats will have evidence of dental disease

## Breeding in cats

Outline female reproduction in cats
?
Females start cycling from 4-10 months; males can sire offspring from about 5 months. The majority would be towards the younger end of the age range
Seasonally polyoestrous and usually cycle from spring until autumn (although can cycle throughout the year)
Oestrus is called being on heat, in season, on call. Lasts 7-10 days and comes into season gain after 2-3 weeks
Induced ovulators

Outline pregnancy and weaning cats
?
Gestation lasts approximately 63 days
U/S form 3 weeks post-breeding is the best way to detect pregnancy and assess the viability of kittens
A lateral abdominal radiograph in late gestation is the best way to assess the number of kittens
Queening is mostly uneventful; brachycephalics are the most likely to have problems
Neonatal care is not covered here
Start weaning at 4 weeks - the gradual introduction of milk replacer and wet kitten food
Usually transition over 4-6 weeks to solid food

Outline desexing in female cats
?
Female = spay (ovariohysterectomy)
Prevention of unwanted kittens
Reduce stray and feral cat issues
Prevention or reduction of hormone-mediated behavioural problems, including attracting toms
Cats are tattooed in the left ear as an indication they have been desexed

OUtline desexing in male cats
?
Castration - orchiectomy
3 main reasons to castrate:
- Prevention of unwanted kittens
- Reduce stray and feral cat issues
- Prevention or reduction of hormone-mediated behavioural problems (roaming, urine spraying)
- Must be tattooed in left ear
