# IVP - L4 - Fundamental Components Of Food
## Intended Learning Outcomes
- Describe the constituents of animal feeds, in order to explain their role in body processes and their importance in the diets of animals.
- Explain the methods and units used to measure feed constituents and dietary availability, in order to understand feed labelling and feed quality when recommending or formulating diets.

What are the macronutrients::carbohydrate, fat, protein, fibre

Why does the dry matter concentration exist on feed::Water content affects the concentration so dry matter allows us to normalize it

What are the micronutrients::Minerals and vitamins which can be broken further into macro and micro-minerals and fat and water soluble vitamins

What is digestibility::A measure of an animals or foods ability to be digested given that an animal is never 100% efficient

How do we calculate digestibility::Measure what you give and subtract what remains in the faeces

What are some of the dietary factors
?
Taste: sweet vs bitter, texture, odour, visual appearance
Forage composition: + Fibre + gut fill, chewing/rumination time
Feed processing: smaller particles =  more intake, selective feed behaviour, addition of flavour, less digestibility = more passage rate
Anti-nutritional factors: physical defences (coarseness. prickles) reduces intake, tannins and alkaloids reduce intake
Other: energy density, water

What is energy when talking about macronutrients::baseline feed requirement for animal nutrition (usually measured as heat), calorie: amount of heat required to the temperature of 1 g of$H_2O$ by $1\textdegree C$. 1 calorie = 4.184 joules

Describe energy partitioning in animals
?
Gross energy: calculated by combusting the feed using a bomb calorimeter
Digestible energy (monogastric): amount of energy retain inside the animal, lost in faeces
Metabolizable energy (ruminants): amount in animal including loses in urine energy and methane energy
Net energy (warm blooded): loss due to heat increment aka maintain body temperature
The remaining energy is used for maintenance and production

How much more energy is stored in fat compared to carbohydrates::double

## Proteins and Lipids
What are proteins made of::chains of amino acids

What is more important in nutrition the protein being fed or the amino acid composition of the protein being fed::amino acid composition

What is a type of protein that is difficult to digest::collagen

What is the name of the method used to crudely estimate the amount of protein in a feedstuff and how does it work::liberate all the protein and measure the amount which is called crude protein estimation and uses the Kjeldahl method for estimate

What does the term biological value mean::amount of absorbed protein that is retained by animal

What does the term limiting amino acid mean::aa found in the lowest quantity in a feedstuff, thus limiting protein construction

Essential amino acids:: aa that cannot be made by the body in sufficient quantities. Must b in diet.

List the essential amino acids in dogs and cats::arginine, histidine, isoleucine, lysine, leucine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, valine, taurine (cats)

What amino acid is really important to consider in pig feed::lysine

Why are ruminants more complicated to feed::bacterial breaks down the protein first so you are stuck with the bacteria material

Provide a general overview of lipids in nutrition
?
Lipids: fats (animal based) and oils (plant based)
- Simple lipids: (triglycerides)
- Compound lipids (phospholipids)
- Others: waxes, steroids, etc.
Energy storage mechanism
Essential Fatty Acids

What is the name of the enzyme that cats lack for fatty acid metabolism which dogs have::delta 6 desaturase

Provide an overview of fibre
?
Soluble: fermentable to physiologically active compounds (gases)
Insoluble: metabolically inert. Important in aiding passage of digesta
Often used a dietary filler, weight control diets

## Vitamins and Minerals

What are the two types of vitamins
?
Fat soluble: 
- Absorbed with fat in small intestine
- Stored in liver and adipose tissues
- Toxicities
Water soluble: 
- Absorbed in small intestine
- Filtered by kidneys and excreted
- Daily need - no toxicities

What are the names and symbols of the fat soluble vitamins
?

| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| B complex | Thiamin                                                             |

Provide an overview of minerals in nutrition
?

Micro-minerals: chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt, molybdenum, copper, zinc, fluoride, iodine, selenium, silicon, tin, arsenic, nickel, present in body tissues at concentration < 50 mg/kg

## Measuring Feed Components

What are the three main ways of measuring feed components
?
in vivo: expensive but specific, growth trials, indicator trials
in vitro: cheaper, not species specific, chemistry, fermenters
in sacco: ruminant studies

Describe in sacco studies::You cut a hole in the side of a ruminant and place bags inside and take them out at different times to measure the effect
