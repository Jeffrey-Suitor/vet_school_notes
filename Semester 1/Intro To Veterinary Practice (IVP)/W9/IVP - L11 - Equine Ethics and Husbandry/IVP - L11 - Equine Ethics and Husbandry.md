Ruminants are part of artiodactyl which is an even number of digits

Outline the evolution of the horse
?
150 million years ago
hyracotherium "goat-like" 1m tall odd-toed ungulate
Climate change caused a shift from rainforest (which covered most of the Earth) to large patches of open savannah grassland
Since leafy food became scarce, had to adapt to the new food source (grass) and lifestyle
**Required need for serious speed --> Flight**

What are the drivers for horse evolution
?
Need for greater speed and body size to escape predators --> Long limbs, strong backs
Cool climate during Cenozoic replaced forests with grasslands. Large powerful jaws and teeth
Simple hooves and elongated legs adapted for speed in open (exposed) plains

What are the consequences of this adaptation of an evolutionary adaptation of horses?
?
Flight animal capable of serious speed (and momentum)
Vulnerability to injury
Preventative measures vital:
- Require safe robust fencing and a calm environment
- Avoid environments where sudden changes in noise, movement and wind are likely
Vulnerability to catastrophic fractures
- Huge forces on limb bones at top speed
- Modelling/remodelling of bone with exercise

What are the horse's adaptations for grazing
?
Hypsodont type teeth for grazing
Cheek teeth with bands of enamel and less hard cementum and dentine on the crown
Open tooth roots permitting continuous eruption
Larger teeth and a larger skull to hold them

What are the problems that can only occur in horses
?
Difficult to examine properly
May develop sharp edges or hooks, especially if receiving insufficient forage
Edges/hooks may require 'floating' (filing) every 6 months or so
Waves or steps in the cheek teeth arcades cause a significant problem for a breakdown of long stems of forage
Insufficient grinding of forage may be associated with choke or reduced forage digestion/utilisation

Outline the equine digestive tract
?
Simple stomach designed for small frequent meals
Large sacculated hindgut adapted to fibre digestion
horses adapted to graze - with good quality fibre a critical element to digestive health


Outline horse hindgut fermentation
?
Adapted to the grazing of pasture through most of the day
NOT adapted to being stabled and fed infrequent large meals, especially of grain
Always make any dietary changes gradually (over 10-14 days)
Avoid disrupting hindgut bacteria
Poor dietary management of horses - beware of nasty surprises
Gastric ulceration; colic; colitis; enteritis; laminitis

What are the essentials for equine digestive health
?
Forage fed at a rate of at least 1.5-2% of the horse's body weight per day
Good quality hay and pasture allow the horse to get optimal nutrition
ideally no more than 1% of the horse's body weight should be fed as grain (never more than 50% of the diet)
Include adequate amounts of all nutrients (water, protein, carbohydrates, fat, vitamins and minerals)
Proper dental care and routine deworming enhances feed utilisation

Outline what founder (laminitis) in horses
?
Stretching and separation of lamellae that attach the pedal bone to the hoof wall
The pedal bone may lose support within the hoof and rotates downward
Causes crippling lameness
Long-term chronic problems and recurrence
Very common - 15% of ponies/pleasure horses suffer from laminitis at some stage

What are the causes of laminitis?
?
Most common:
- Lush pasture or high carbohydrate diet in susceptible breeds/individuals
- Very high insulin causes changes to lamellar tissues
Less common:
- Acute carbohydrate overload (free access to grain in an open feed bin)
- Colic, colitis
- Retained placenta; other severe infections
- (All above cause release of inflammatory toxins)
- Excessive weight bearing or concussion

Outline equine metabolic syndrome
?
Insulin resistance, obesity, predisposition to laminitis
Ponies, some horse breeds, prone to obesity
Abnormal fat deposition (cresty neck)
Grazing on lush grass (high sugar content) can result in very high plasma insulin levels
Insulin dysregulation causes high insulin levels
Predisposes to laminitis (endocrine form)
Breed susceptible to EMS:
- Most pony breeds:
  - Shetlands, Welsh, New Forest, Dartmoor, Exmoor, Connemara
- A few horse breeds:
  - Andalusians, Paso Finos, Tennessee Walkers, Morgans, Spanish Mustang, some Quarterhorses

Why do some ponies/horses get EMS laminitis and not others?
?
Different subspecies arose during the Pleistocene era (2.5M - 11,000 years ago) during and after the last ice age
W. European species more metabolically efficient: 'good doers'; 'easy keeps'; Ponies and Spanish breeds
High insulin levels maximise body fat storage (thrifty phenotype)
Can't cope with modern lush pastures (developed to maximise growth in cattle and sheep)
Genes + Environment = epigenetics

What are the implications of husbandry for ponies
?
Owners should be very careful to allow ponies (and some horse breeds) access to lush pastures in Spring because this may cause laminitis
Lush pastures may be up to 30% DM non-structural carbohydrates (sugars, fructans)
If an animal had previously had laminitis, they are at high risk and should never be allowed on lush pasture (some have to be permanently managed on dirt yards)
Obesity indicates that insulin levels may be high and animals could be at risk of laminitis if inappropriate feeding or pasture management
Obesity is very common in the Australian population (32% in ponies, 9% in horses)
Owner perceptions of what optimal body condition should look like

Describe external parasites in horses
?
Lice, mange (winter)
- Biting and sucking lice cause pruritus 
- Found in the mane and tail; eggs may be seen with the naked eye
Flies:
- Bot flies - lay eggs on the skin; larvae develop in the stomach (summer/autumn), lay on skin of legs and horses consume eggs that attach to the lining of the stomach,  Use a dewormer in the winter time to prevent
- Midges (culicoides) - may cause hypersensitivity (allergy) reactions, Queensland itch, sweet itch

Outline the internal parasites in horses
?
Larvae from pasture - lifecycles evolved as horses evolved
Include large and small strongyles; ascarids; tapeworms; pinworms (bots)
Reliance over the last 60 years on regular anthelmintic treatment
Benzimidazoles; pyrantels; macrocyclic lactones (avermectins, moxidectin)
BUT resistance is becoming a major problem
Need to prevent both severe infestations and resistance
Requires smarter strategies

What is the current recommendation for internal parasite control
?
Should be tailored to individual needs
Use of routine faecal egg count to identify horses that shed high levels
Anthelmintic treatment to provide evidence of resistance
Surveillance of anthelmintic efficacy
Knowledge of risk factors (target weanlings for ascarids)
Management strategies: Faecal collection; fungus (*Duddingtonia flagrans*)

Outline farriery in horses
?
Hooves grow at about 1mm per day
Wear depends on no ground surface and work
Takes a year for the hoof to grow
Goals for good hoof trim include:
- Bottom of the hoof parallel to the coronet
- Both heels are not too far forward and same height
- Distance from the centre of the frog to the wall should be the same on both sides
- The angle of the hoof is in line with the angle of the pastern

Outline the process of shoeing in horses
?
Provides a well-balanced foot that enables work for longer periods of time without excessively wearing the hoof down and helps maintain the hoof shape
The use of horseshoes can give the horse a good secure grip
- A groove called a fuller runs around the surface of the shoe
- The grip also can be aided by the use of studs
Correcting conformation
- Horses with hoof ailments and poor conformation can be assisted with the use of specific horseshoes which are specially designed to help with that ailment
- Specialist shoes: egg bar, heart bar, racing plates, rolled toe quarter clips
Shoes can be made of steel, aluminium or plastic
The well-shod foot should allow the internal and external structures to expand on impact and therefore assist in lower limb circulation
Barefoot hoof trimming - advocated by some

Outline the process of horse breeding
?
**Gestation** - 11 months
Horses are seasonal (long day) breeders
**Artificial insemination**
- Not permitted in thoroughbreds
- Now routine for other breeds
- A common role for veterinarians
- More mares can be bred to a single stallion
- Mare and stallion do not have to be in the same location
**Castration (gelding)**
- Male horses in Australia are predominantly geldings 
- Testosterone provides breeds and some athletic advantages
- But huge management (and safety) challenges
- Castrated prior to 2-3 years of age generally (though occasionally much later)
**Twinning**
- Intervention before day 16
- Maintaining two foals is hard during the birthing process and hard for the mare
- After twin foaling is identified, one twin can be squashed via manual palpation

Describe the foaling and foal management process
?
Foaling:
- Stage 1 (1-4 hours) restless, may lay down
- Stage 2 (5-20 min) birth - very rapid
- Stage 3 (must be within 3-4 hours) foetal membranes expelled (important)
- Failure to expel can lead to a variety of issues including laminitis and may be fatal
Neonatal foal management
- Colostrum intake important for antibody transfer
- Worm regularly from 2-3 months (ascarid worms)
- Vaccination around 304 months when maternal antibodies are waning
Weaning
- Often between 4-7 months of age
- Various strategies
- Can often be done in groups to help reduce the stress, add a nanny animal, gradually increase, make sure to keep out of eye and earshot

Outline vaccination of adult horses
?
Tetanus:
- Caused by the production of toxins from Clostridium tetani, which is found in soil and can contaminate any wound. Horses are very susceptible
- Vaccines often combined with the tetanus vaccine
- primary course; two injections 4 weeks apart
- Booster: 6-12 months from the third primary injection (depending on exposure risk)
Strangles:
- Caused by infection with the bacteria Streptococcus equi subspecies equi. Highly contagious. Causes fever, nasal discharge and sometimes abscesses in lymph nodes.
- Primary course: three injects at two-week intervals
- Boosters: 6-12 months from the third primary injection (depending on exposure risk)
Hendra:
- Caused by a virus that has bats as its natural reservoir which occasionally infects other species, including horses and humans
- Primary course: two injections 3-6 weeks for microchipped horses over 4 years of age
- Booster: 6 months from the second primary injection
- Vaccinations can start after 4 months of age
- Vaccinations are recorded in a central database
- Primarily seen in Queensland and NSW, due to bat populations moving
All:
- Vaccinations can start after 3 months of age
- Pregnant mares should receive a booster one month prior to birth
- Horses with unknown vaccination history should receive their primary course

Outline the use of horse rugs
?
Horses have evolved to cope with climatic extremes - Gobi desert, the Arabian peninsula, northern Europe
Rugging requirements are not necessary under habituated conditions
However, may be necessary for particular requirements
- Reduce calories required to stay warm (Thoroughbreds especially)
  Aesthetics - keeping conditioning and maintaining a sleek coat
  Insect or UV protection
Horses usually want to stay above 4-5 degrees Celcius

Outline the code of practice for the Welfare of Horses
?
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act (1986) - Victorian State legislation
Details of obligations under this act are set out in the Codes of Practice
The Code of Practice for the Welfare of Horses sets out the minimum level of conduct required to avoid cruelty to horses
Provides information to improve awareness of good welfare practices
Encourage the considerate treatment of horses
