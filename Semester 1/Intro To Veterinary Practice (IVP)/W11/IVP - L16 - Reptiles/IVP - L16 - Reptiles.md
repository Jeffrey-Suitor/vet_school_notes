Detail spotlight vs ceramic lights in reptile tanks::Spotlight is heat + light, ceramic is just heat

All reptiles need heat from above::False, some use heat mats on the ground

Outline the heat requirements for reptiles
?
Reptiles are ectothermic
PBT Preferred Body temperature varies for each body function
POTZ: Preferred Optimal Temperature Zone varies between taxa and species
Heat source preferences vary between taxa

T/F thermometer only measures heat at one point of the tank::True

Outline and control heat for reptiles
?
Gloves: coloured, infrared, ceramic
Heat mats: geckos, low-level background heat
Water heaters: 1 amp per litre
Globe wattage, tank insulation and ventilation affect temp mosaic
Monitor behaviour as well as gauge
Prevent burns
Pythons will wrap around unprotected globes
If a lizard is spending too much time in a high heat zone may be too cold or if spending too much time in a cold zone may be too hot

Outline the light requirements for reptiles
?
Visible light spectrum intensity and colour preferences vary between species
Daily cycle allows for rest
Ultraviolet light
- UVA, B, C
- UVA seems to cause reptiles to do better
- UVB essentials for chelonians, lizards other than geckos, crocodiles

Outline providing light to reptiles
?
Visible light is provided by some heat globes and all UV globes
Colour type preferences for some taxa (bearded dragons like warmer light)
Light/dark cycle
- Necessary for mental health and behaviour
- 12/12 all year 
- seasonal variation

How to provide ultraviolet light for reptiles
?
UVB wavelength 280-315 nm
30cm or less from the basking area
Change the globe every 6 months
Full spectrum is visible UVA spectrum only
Fluorescent, mercury vapour, compact UVB
Blocked by glass and plastic
Important to consider the light cone for the size of the reptile and make sure its big enough

Outline humidity and water for reptiles
?
Humidity % varies between taxa
Enclosure humidity affects hydration, hygiene, the health of skin, lungs and gut and behaviour
Some reptiles drink from containers, others from foliage or misting
Too much access to water can be as unhealthy as too little for some taxa

Outline provision of water/controlling humidity for reptiles
?
Very wide taxa variations
Low humidity: small water bowl at cool end, rare bathing and misting, dry substrates, excellent drainage, fake plants
High humidity: Large shallow water source near heat, foliage, frequent misting, bathing allowed
Good ventilation essential for both

Outline the space requirements for reptiles
?
Enough space to stretch out, climb or swim and to behave normally
Enable retreat from companions
Designed to provide an appropriate temperature mosaic
Arboreal, terrestrial, aquatic
Coinhabitants/sex ratios

Outline squamate enclosure (lizards and snakes)
?
Vivarium
Glass, wood, acrylic, mesh
Consider the insulating qualities of materials and absorbency
Size for snakes should allow them to stretch out to full length across the diagonal
Arboreal tanks are tall, terrestrial long
Greater heat mosaic range in larger tanks

Outline aquatic tanks and pools for reptiles
?
Chelonians, crocodiles, water monitors, some dragons
Basking or land area appropriate for species, UVB and heat above it
Water heater (1 amp per litre for effective heating) and thermostat
Filtration: external canisters most effective
Water quality monitoring

Outline substrates and furnishings for lizard tanks
?
Consider hygiene, thermal properties, absorbency, abrasiveness
Turf, newspaper, commercial litter, stones, slate tiles, bark, sand, tubs of litter
Furnishings
- Logs, rocks, tiles, plants, artificial works
- Hides, burrow, screening

How do we facilitate normal behaviours?
?
Nocturnal, crepuscular, and diurnal will change the activity and timing of heat
Housing ratios
Hides and camouflage
burrowing and digging
Climbing
Thermogeregulatin
Bathing
Ecdysis (be able to shed)

Outline handling and socialising of reptiles
?
Handling reptiles usually takes them out of their POTZ
Socialising with mammalian carnivores is usually stressful
Being under constant surveillance by us or other pets is very stressful
vibrations through tanks also cause stress

Outline the enrichment for reptiles
?
Change tank furnishing and plants
Don't overcrowd tank furnishings as it can make basking and movement difficult
Spartan tanks are easy to clean but provide poor enrichment
Vary substrates provided
Beware of mite contamination if using natural furnishings or recycling from other tanks

Outline the diet of reptiles
?
Snakes: whole prey, never live prey
Chelonians: Tortoises are terrestrial and herbivores. Turtles are aquatic. freshwater turtles eat invertebrates with varying proportions of insects
Lizards: very wide range of dietary niches
Corcoildes: carnivores

Outline whole prey diets
?
It is illegal to feed live venerable prey
Rodents, rabbits poultry
Snakes and large carnivorous lizards
Live invertebrates and fish may be fed
The quality of the diet is only as good as the quality of the raising of the prey items

Invertebrate and vegetable diet for reptiles
?
Crickets, woodies, mealworms, snails, earthworms, slaters, millipedes, moths, flies (wild caught and cultured)
Variety of invertebrates is best
Chopped leafy greens
Pieces of hard vegetables like carrot and sweet potato are good for teeth

Outline the supplements needed for reptiles
?
Calcium carbonate (every invertebrate feed)
Vitamin D3
Multivitamins (once weekly)
Method of delivery affects intake
- Dust just before feeding out
- Dusting is no use for aquatic feeders
- Feed out small numbers of inverts
- Gut loading ensures delivery but kills inverts faster

Outline the hygiene of reptiles
?
Aquatic
- Water quality monitoring: Nitrogen cycle, water hardness, pH
- Filtration - in a tank vs. external, under gravel
- Partial water changes
Vivarium
- Daily spot cleaning, 3-6 monthly scrub F10
- Mite prevention and treatment

Outline the tank set-up considerations
?
Ectotherms with individual POTZs
- Heat source management, basking opportunities, insulation, ventilation
Light (Visible and UVB)
- UVB globe type, position, age of the globe
- Day length
Humidity
- Water source, misting, furnishing, ventilation

Outline enrichment and disease prevention in reptiles
?
Hygiene
- Humidity, cleaning, substrate management
- Mite prevention
Handling
- Time out of the tank, comfort with being handled
Appropriate diet and delivery of food items
Housing ratios
Monitor equipment and behaviour

Outline the roles of reptiles in Australia
?
Laws vary between states and territories in regard to which species can be kept and if licences are required
Species that are exotic to Australia cannot be kept as pets or sold in the pet trade
Captive breeding and capture from the wild are regulated
Common Squamate (lizards and snakes, including lizards from the dragon, skin, monitor and gecko taxa, snakes from the python family, and less commonly venomous snakes)
Common chelonians kept include long necked turtles and Murray basing turtles
Crocodilians such as freshwater and estuarine crocodiles are kept in smaller numbers

Why do vets want to work with reptiles
?
Incredible variation in structure, function and ecology
Forging new ground/frontier science
Gaining skills few others have
Contact with tame wonderful animals
Finding solutions for difficult or unquantified problems

OUtline reptile veterinary frustrations
?
A paucity of high-quality research
Few evidence-based academic or lay references
Poor resources: equipment, medication, established evidence-based theory and practice
Community education via social media
Our knowledge base is small and we are often working from the first principals
Many vets do not know what they don't know and a little knowledge can loom large in an industry where little is known
Speciesism

Where do reptiles come from::Pet shops, cannot take from the wild unless licensed

How regulated is the reptile industry::Not very well regulated

Outline the reptile trade in Victoria
?
Licensing through the state government (DELWP currently)
captive breeding
- Morbidity and mortality
- Selective breeding for beauty/strength/longevity in captivity versus their own habits
- Swap meets with large biosecurity risks
- Harvesting from the wild is only partially regulated

What are the benefits of reptiles in the cavity
?
Reptiles often attract highly engaged owners
This should mean that
- Pet needs are immediately noted and provided for
- Not fighting to survive for themselves
- Plenty of attention and food
Humans direct selection to make them better pets

What are the roles of vets in the reptile trade
?
Working on welfare
Promoting the sharing of evidence-based care
Encouraging people to explore beyond the pet shop or forum
Learning from and with the Herpetology community

What are the common health problems in reptiles
?
Commonly related to a lack of understanding of the ectotherm
Husbandry is often deficient in one or more of the following
- Accessible appropriate thermal range
- UVB of the right strength, within the right distance and large enough area
- Visible light colour, type and day/night cycle
- A balanced diet and appropriate supplementation of minerals
Opportunities for traumatic injury during
- Feeding in groups or leaving uneaten live prey with the pet
- Vivarium doors and tails, escape attempts
- Gardening and turtles
Contagious diseases and parasites

Outline common reptile diseases
?
Dietary/heat/UVB relationship failing: metabolic bone disease
- Nutritional secondary hyperparathyroidism
- Caused by a single or multiple deficits in the complex interaction between
  - UVB exposure
  - Dietary calcium provision
  - Access to thermal gradient appropriate to species to enable the animal to reach the preferred body temperature for metabolism
  - Successful absorption and metabolism of calcium and Vitamin D
  - Bones will not be strong and straight
Malnutrition (over or underfeeding nutrients)
- Gout (excessive protein in diet - urate crystals build up in organs and joints)
- Hypovitaminosis A (in herbivores lacking orange and red vegetables)
Poor hygiene (of substrate/air/water) or inappropriate humidity
- Dermatitis
- Dysecdysis (difficulty shedding)
- Stomatitis
- Sepsis
- Caused by an inadequate temperature gradient, poor diet, and lack of appropriate access to ultraviolet light, UVA and UVB
- Ear abscesses can arise from infection in the mouth, stomatitis, or from the respiratory system
Lack of quarantine and biosecurity protocols/outdoor enclosures
- Ectoparasites
- Neurorespiratory viral infections
Trauma
Proliferative lesions can be viral or neoplastic: papillomavirus, excessive UV exposure

T/F It is illegal to feed live mammalian or avian prey::True

T/F Live insects and live fish can be fed::True and they still pose a significant risk of not being eaten. Crickets can chew ulcers into Bearded dragons. Feeder fish can chew the toes off small or lethargic turtles

Outline reptile zoonoses
?
Faeco-oral transmission such as 
- Enteric bacteria such as salmonella
- Protozoans such as Giardia
- Flukes, tapeworms, roundworms
Ectoparasites - direct or environmental contact
- Mites suhc as Ophionyssus natricus (direct contact)
- Ticks (indirect contact from the habitat of the reptile)
Vector-borne diseases such as Rickettsia
Puncture wounds allow the introduction of infections such as Mycobacteria
