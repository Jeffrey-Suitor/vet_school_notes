# IVP - L15 - Small Mammals

## Intended Learning Outcomes
- Describe breeding, management, nutrition, animal welfare and common causes of disease of small mammal pets 
- Describe the role of veterinarians within the exotic and unusual pet industries

## Small Animals

What animals are considered exotic pets::all non-cat/dog pets

T/F exotic pets are rapidly expanding::True

T/F exotic pets are mostly using drugs off label::True

Is there a large evidence base medicine for exotic pet practice::No, mostly anecdotal

What causes the majority of diseases in exotic pet practice::poor husbandry

Exotic pet practice usually involves deliberate neglect

What is the role of veterinarians in exotic pet practice
?
Should have basic knowledge of biology, husbandry, behaviour and common diseases
Veterinary practice should be a well-recognised and trusted source of information and the first port of call. Rarely happens and you are only consulted when animals become sick
You can prevent a large array of common diseases easily which has economic and welfare benefits

What are small mammals and key areas of veterinarians?
?
Range of domesticated and non-domesticated species
Used to be children's pets but they are no longer
Key areas of advice are:
- Basic biology -sexing
- Nutrition
- Housing and environmental requirements
- Behavioural management 

Outline the behaviour of small mammals 
?
Rodents are rabbits are prey species
Easily stressed by sight, sound, smell of predators, unfamiliar surroundings, large bright open spaces
Adverse effects on gut health/motility (rabbit, chinchilla, guinea pigs) and immune function
Hide overt signs of disease until advanced times
Important to minimize stress at all times

What are the two types of rodents we keep
?
Differences in dentition, diet, and gastrointestinal function, and reproductive strategies
Mouse, rate, hamster, gerbil: myomorphs
Guinea pig (cavy), chinchilla, degu: hystricomorphs
Scuiromophs are chipmunks and prairie dogs

Compare and contrast myomorphs and hystricomorphs
?

Outline diet, and husbandry needs, of rats and mice
?
Social animals: desexing important for population control and disease prevention -> usually males
Housing: Open-sided cages for ventilation, shredded paper, recycled-paper cat litter
Enrichment: cardboard rolls, wooden blocks for chewing, coloured paper, food reward puzzles
Diet; Omnivorous; commercial pellets, fresh produce, sunflower seeds as treats only, do not feed human food as they can become obese easily
Common diseases:
- Rats - respiratory disease, benign mammary adenocarcinoma, pituitary adenomas, 
- Mice - Malignant mammary neoplasia
rats you can remove tumours because the prognosis is good but in mice, they tend to metastasise and so treatment is not recommended

Outline diet, and husbandry needs, of hamsters
?
Golden/Syrian hamsters: solitary, hibernate
Russian hamsters and Chinese: social, do not hibernate
Housing: Cages - wire, plastic, glass, tunnel systems
- Cage furniture - exercise wheel, wood
- Beeding - deep shavings, nest box
- Do not use cotton wool because it can end up in cheek pouches
Diet: commercial rodent, pellet, vegetables, nuts, occasional insects, animal protein in the wild; Hoard food
Common diseases: demodectic mange, skin tumours

T/F hamster basic packs are well suited to hamsters::False, they fail to provide adequate enrichment and space. 

How far can hamsters travel in a day::10 km

T/F hamsters are nocturnal::True

Diet: 70-80% grass hay (Oaten) + 20-30% fresh, leafy greens + 0-5% pellets and treats (Oxbow), not root vegetables, or fruits
Housing: Variable but need lots of to run (time out of cage essential)

Outline environment hutches
?
A hutch is not enough
Ideally, all rabbits should have a large, secure hutch or indoor cage with access to a large run to allow freedom to express natural behaviour

Outline the substrates for rabbits
?
Cat litter for the latrine areas - wood-based pellets are best
Newspaper
Dust-free woodshaving, paper-based. Carefresh, compost soil for digging
Hay, hay and hay!!! For eating and bedding
Kept on grass and concrete as long as not always on concrete due to pressure sores
Carpet or laminate flooring but be careful of carpet floors, and laminate floors are slippy

Outline environmental enrichment for rabbits
?
Express natural behaviours
- Running
- Jumping
- Standing on hind legs

- Chewing
- Hiding

Outline house rabbits
?
Rabbits can make good house pets and can be litter trained

- Destructive 
  - Chewing 
  - Digging
NORMAL BEHAVIOUR

Outline the sexing of rabbits
?
Slit-like vulval opening

Nest-building - pluck hair
Altricial young; suckle for only 3-5 minutes per day, which reduces the chances of predators finding the babies
Young are called kittens
