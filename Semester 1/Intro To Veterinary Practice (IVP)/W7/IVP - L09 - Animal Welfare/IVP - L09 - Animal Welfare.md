# IVP - L09 - Animal Welfare

## Intended Learning Outcomes
- Describe the development of societal concern for animal welfare and the factors that drove this concern for the welfare of animals 
- Describe the philosophical concepts involved in animal use and management by humans, and the varying concepts of animal welfare in order to understand differing approaches 
- Apply the Five Domains animal welfare assessment framework in order to make a comparative evaluation of different animal management strategies

## Animal Welfare

How was animal welfare in the pre 1820s::Abuse of animals was quite commonplace, not legally prevented

Why did people pre-1820s usually appear to be indifferent to the suffering of animals::De Carte believed in reductionism, which was when people were trying to find out more about the world and so live animal dissections were performed and he advocated that we should look at the reductionist view where if a dog cried out it was a response rather than an indication of suffering. No higher-order consciousness

When was the first anti-cruelty bill in the UK::1822 by Richard Martin

What was the Massachusetts body of Liberties (1641-1684) passage 92::A section talking about how there should be no cruelty to animals

What did Pythagoras teach in regards to animal welfare and when::520 BCE, and he taught that animals have souls and advocate for vegetarianism

What did Indian emperor Ashoka edict regarding animal protection::Advocating vegetarianism and protections for wild and domestic animals in 232 BCE

What did Japanese Emperor Tenmu advocate in regards to animal welfare::Banned eating meat except for fish in 675 BCE

What did Al-Ma'arri of Syria advocate for in 973 BCE::He stopped using any animal products and is the first documented vegan

What happened in the early 20th century in regards to animal welfare::Larger focus on preventing cruelty to animals

What happened in the late 20th century in regards to animal welfare::Shift of focus from prevention of cruelty to duty of care

What are the modern 5 freedoms of animals
?
Freedom from hunger and thirst
Freedom from discomfort
Freedom from pain, injury and disease
Freedom to express normal behaviour
Freedom from fear and distress

What is the shift in animal welfare in the 21st century::Consumer choice of different products

How is modern animal welfare compared to previous versions::Best it has ever been but the perception from the public may be different. Changing attitudes of society intersect with changing roles of animals in our society.

How has increasing urbanisation impacted the view of animals in our society::Has caused people to want a higher standard of care and insist upon it

How has increasing economic productivity impacted animal welfare::More growth means better and more stable food options with food costs making a smaller percentage of income as wealth grows so people can be more selective about how they spend their money

How has mechanisation improved farming::Mechanisation allowed the automation of feeding, cleaning, collection, egg grading, and packaging, making it more efficient to use intensive systems. There are also benefits in disease prevention as their environment is more controlled and they aren't in their faeces. However, these changes became more public in the 1960s and 1970s, raising public awareness of these intensive systems.

What factors have driven the changes in animal welfare::Urbanisation, increasing wealth overall, changing animal management practices and the role of animals in society.

T/F the ownership of dogs in Australia has decreased while spending on dogs has increased::True

How have the different animal sectors responded to animal welfare industry
?
Don't mention the war: Not talk about it, minimise it and hope it doesn't grow
Look - we're working on animal welfare issues: They claim to be working on while having projects going
Let's identify the problem areas, deal with them, and proactively address public and market interest in welfare: A much more sustainable approach as it is proactive

What is the animal welfarist point of view on animal welfare::Position that it is morally acceptable for humans to use non-human animals, provided that adverse effects on animal welfare are minimised as far as possible

What is the utilitarian point of view and who was the most prominent utilitarian::Jeremy Bentham, and the view is the right course of action is that one that maximises the overall good consequences of the action. It is a form of consequentialism meaning that the moral worth of actions is determined by their resulting outcomes. The question is can animals suffer.

What is Peter Singer's philosophies underpin animal welfare::Equal consideration of similar interests. His argument is that both humans and animals have an interest in eating them and because they are not equal as the animal's interest is absolute we should not eat animals.

What is Tom Regan's philosophy of animal welfare::Animals are "subjects-of-a-life", who have moral rights for that reason, and moral rights ought not to be ignored.

What is Gary Francione's philosophy on animal rights::Animals have one moral right, and need one legal one: the right not to be regarded as property. All else will follow

What is the difference between animal welfare and animal rights?
?
Animal welfare: the concern for an animal's wellbeing, associated with the concept that animals should be humanely treated and not unnecessarily suffer.
- Typically accepting of some animal utilisation by humans
- Positions may vary on exactly what is acceptable
Animal rights - a philosophical position that animals have inherent moral rights
- Animal utilisation by humans contravenes the rights of animals
- If animals consent to live with us (by their actions) then that can be ok
**Both positions can agree on the need to improve animal treatment but tend to differ in their end goals**

What are some current concepts in animal welfare
?
Checklists
Animal welfare as a biological state
Animal feelings

What are the five freedoms of animal welfare
?
Freedom from thirst, hunger, and malnutrition
Freedom from discomfort
Freedom from pain, injury and disease
Free to express normal behaviour
Freedom from fear and distress

What are the five obligations (NZ Animal Welfare)
?
Proper and sufficient food and water
Adequate shelter
The opportunity to display normal patterns of behaviour
Appropriate physical handling
Protection from, and rapid diagnosis of, injury and disease

What are the pros of checklists for animal welfare
?
Pros: a simple and straightforward, rapid screening test
Cons: simplistic, what are the normal levels of these components?, What are the consequences for the animal if they are not normal

How do we consider animal welfare as a biological state::Homeostasis mechanisms act in response to stressors? Adverse consequences for fitness if control mechanisms fail to cope adequately

What are some examples of potential stressors in animals and describe the biological response
?
Crowing, too hot
Recognition of a threat to homeostasis which initiates a stress response and if the animal can't cope you get the consequences of stress
1. Stimulus 
2. Perception of stressor 
3. Organisation of biological defence 
4. Biological response (behavioural, autonomic, endocrine)
5. Change in biological function -> stimulus
6. If the animal cannot cope it enters a pre-pathological state
7. Development of pathology

T/F animals who are continually challenged but can cope will not experience negative consequences::False, some scientists have postulated that there is a cost to mounting a biological response that diverts from the animal's ability to respond appropriately. This can lead to decreased growth or birth.

What are some elements of animal biology that we can measure to determine if they are experiencing events which disturb homeostasis::Cortisol in blood and saliva, changes in behaviour

Outline how the concept of animal feelings can underpin animal welfare::Animals feelings describe that an animal is sentient and how the animal feels is the most important component of its welfare. It depends on animal sentience, preference, and motivation.

Describe the five domains of the animal welfare
?
1. Nutrition: water deprivation, food deprivation, malnutrition
2. Environment: Physical and atmospheric challenge
3. Health: Disease, injury and functional impairment
4. Behavioural and/or interactive movement restrictions
5. Mental domain: Thirst, hunger, anxiety, fear, pain distress and is a combination of the above 4 domains.


## Learning Activities

**Learning Activity 1: Welfare or rights?**

Both animal welfare and animal rights organisations are typically interested in advancing what they view as priorities in animal welfare. This means that the distinctions between the two categories can become blurred, however the underpinning philosophies are different concerning the acceptability of animal use for human benefit.

Find the websites for the following organisations, and identify whether they are based primarily on an animal welfare or an animal rights outlook.

**RSPCA Australia**
They do a lot of political work. The advocate for the benefits of animals and everyone involved but don't advocate for a philosophical position. ANIMAL WELFARE
**PETA Australia**
They advocate from a philosophical position that "animals are not ours to eat, wear, experiment on, use for entertainment or abuse in any way". ANIMAL RIGHTS
**Animal Liberation Australia**
They advocate for improving the lives of animals by using existing systems and providing education and doing research. ANIMAL WELFARE
**Compassion in World Farming**
They advocate for ending factory farming as they view it as the largest source of cruelty but do not make a stance against the use of animals. ANIMAL WELFARE

**Learning Activity 2: Greyhound racing 2015**

Greyhound racing became the focus of intense controversy in 2015. Have a look at the website of the television program ‘Four Corners’ that exposed animal welfare problems. You don’t need to watch the whole video - there is a text summary, as well as a full transcript of the program available if you wish to read further.

[Four Corners- Greyhound racing programLinks to an external site.](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-02-16/making-a-killing/6127124 "Link")

Now have a look at the initial responses of the greyhound industry CEO (at 25:10 in the video)

Within which of the following stages of industry response to an animal welfare issue do you assess this response best fits?

-   'Don’t mention the war'
-   'Look - we’re working on animal welfare issues'
-   'Let’s identify the problem areas, deal with them, and proactively address market interest in welfare'

This falls into the "Don't mention the war" as he claims no responsibility and claims to know nothing about the issue and falls back on previously established rules rather than move forward and try to take responsibility and promise something such as an investigation.
