# IVP - L07 - Problem Behaviours

## Intended Learning Outcomes
- Describe strategies for introducing new animals into a household applying principles of dog and cat behaviour and communication 
- Explain options for management of undesirable behaviours in order to improve welfare outcomes for humans and dog

## Introducing New Household Members

### Cat to Cat
What is the first step when performing cat to cat introductions
?
Before the new cat arrives, set up that can be closed off from the house with all the resources the new cat will need
Resources should come with the cat or be new
Spray Feliway in the new cat's room and around the house
Cat should come straight into the room without seeing the resident cat
Allow time to become used to people and routine and for scent to become part of the room

What is the second step of cat to cat introductions::Scent swapping using a blanket or similar from each cat; visiting the other cat's area

What is the third step in cat to cat introductions::visual contact through a physical barrier

What is the fourth step in cat to cat introductions::supervised contact

### Dog to Dog
What is the first step of dog to dog introductions::meet on neutral territory

What is the second step of dog to dog introductions::reward good behaviour when around the other dog

What is the third step of dog to dog introductions::introduce at home through a baby gate, removing items that might cause tension

What is the fourth step of dog to dog introductions::supervised interactions with separate resources areas until confident they are getting along

### Dog to Resident Cat
What are the 4 steps in introducing a new dog to a resident cat
?
1. Preparation of core safe area for cat; install baby gate and Feliway diffuser (ideal but optional); prepare area for dog
2. Animals take turns to have access to the house while other is confined in its safe place over a few days
3. Introduce through a baby gate when dog is calm, make sure the cat has easy access to escape routes
4. Supervised interactions with escape areas until for the cat until confident they are getting along

### Cat to Resident Dog
What are the 4 steps to introducing a cat to a resident dog
?
1: Prepare a core area for the new cat with all resources in a room that can be closed off. Bring the new cat straight into the room and allow it several days at least to settle in the room and with the new owner.
2: Secure the dog in a space with all its short-term needs to allow the cat to explore the house and become familiar with the dogâ€™s scent. Do this daily over a few days so they become aware of each other before they meet.
3: If introduction through a baby gate is possible do that first. If not, have the dog on a leash or in a crate (if trained) for the first meeting. Praise both for relaxed behaviour (best to have a person with each animal if possible). Allow the cat to approach if it wants to but donâ€™t force.
4: Only leave them alone when you are confident they can tolerate each other and always make sure the cat has a safe retreat the dog canâ€™t get into.

## Managing Problem Behaviours

What are some of the types of undesirable behaviours we may wish to manage
?
Normal behaviour (especially for young animals) but annoying e.g. dog dost not sit, cat scratching furniture
Non-pathologic behaviours which are significantly impact the owners e.g. dog barking excessively at strangers passing, cat urinating outside the litter box
Fear/anxiety problems, e.g. fear-based aggression. There are much more complex due to emotional (unconscious) response
Three major strategies for management:
- Behavioural modification
- Environmental modification
- Pharmacological modification

What are the two primary types of conditioning::operant conditioning is about associating a voluntary behaviour and a consequence; classical conditioning involves associating an involuntary response to a stimulus

Give an example of operant conditioning::dog brings paper, you reward dog with treats, if you don't reward dog won't do it

Provide a summary of classical conditioning
?
Involves the amygdala (primitive part of the brain strongly involved in the emotional response)
Unconscious learning through pairing of stimuli
The conditioned stimulus elicits an emotional state (anxiety, fear, sexual behaviours, salivation)
Responses elicited are mostly autonomic (adrenaline, pupil size, heart rate, salivation)
Responses are fast and cannot be delayed
These responses cannot be rewarded or punished
Principles of classical conditioning are used for desensitisation and counter conditioning

Describe classical "unconditioning" / desensitisation
?
Very gradual exposure to the scary thing, starting at a very low level and building up very slowly. At every step on the way, dog needs to be happy and comfortable
Going too fast may frighten the dog, resulting in sensitisation instead of desensitisation

Describe classical counter-conditioning
?
Used to change the pet's emotional response, feeling or attitude toward a stimulus. It pairs the presence of the negative stimulus (scary thing) with a favourite reward to change the animal's emotional state
Desensitisation and counter-conditioning are often used in combination

What are some of the advantages of environmental modification vs behavioural modification
?
Advantages: often relatively easy, usually reversible, easy to identify changes in behaviour after changing the environment
Disadvantages: Doesn't address the behaviour
Dog example: modifying territorial aggression through blocking visual access
Cat example: Separation from stressor

What is pharmacological behavioural modifications::can reduce fear and anxiety, reduces arousal - high levels of arousal (readiness to act in a given situation) inhibits memory formation and interfere with desensitisation and counter conditioning. Also is good welfare for animal and owner 

What is the role of a veterinary behaviourist consult
?
Significant cost - $400 - $800 but brings about improvement in most cases
Will assess animals for underlying medical issues and dispense medication as needed
AVA has a special interest group (SIG) centred on behaviour, of which many specialists are members

What is the role of trainers
?
No registration or compulsory qualifications
Not able to dispense medication
Quality varies:
- Some trainers are excellent - follow best practice refer to veterinary behaviourist as required (and behaviourists may refer to them in appropriate cases)
- Most are good in operant conditioning

If a case of behaviour is not resolvable with training and behaviourists, what other options are available
?
Rehoming can be a good solution in cases where environmental modification may change the outcome
Earlier stats on shelters demonstrate how often this is attempted
Careful vetting of potential owners to ensure they are aware of and willing to manage the issue
Euthanasia in behaviour cases needs to be an option where:
- There is poor animal welfare for which the causes cannot be treated. This may be the best outcome for those animals
- Where there is risk to human health
