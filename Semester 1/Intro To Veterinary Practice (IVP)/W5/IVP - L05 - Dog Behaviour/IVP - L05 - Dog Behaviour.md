# IVP - L05 - Dog Behaviour

## Intended Learning Outcomes
- Intended learning outcomes Explain how a dogâ€™s sensory experience of the world may influence its behaviour in order to best understand the dogâ€™s behaviour 
- Apply an understanding of the normal body language and behaviour of dogs in order to interpret their interactions with humans and other dogs
- Describe strategies to prevent development of problem behaviours to maximise the welfare outcomes for humans and dogs

## Sensing the world and communicating feelings

What is the definition of animal behaviour::animal behaviour includes all the ways animals interact with other organisms and the physical environment

What are some factors that can determine animal behaviour::genetic predisposition, learning, environment

What are some reasons why vets need to understand animal behaviour::safety of humans and animals

What is the veterinarians' role in the human animal bond::The veterinarian's role in the human animal bond is to maximize the potential relationship between people ann animals

T/F emotional and behavioural animal states can affect treatment and diagnostic actions::True

How strong is a dogs sense of smell::10,000 to 100,000 times stronger than humans (varies with breed)

T/F pups are born with eyes and ears sealed shut so smell and touch are their only guide for 2-3 weeks::True

Describe the olfactory system in dogs
?
Dogs have an accessory olfactory system in addition to main olfactory pathways
The vomeronasal organ (two fluid filled sacs at the base of the nasal cavity) is key. It detects scents from pheromones (chemical substances that transmit information between animals of the same species)
Signal from the vomeronasal organ go to the amygdala, which handles instinctive, motions, fear, aggression, sexual urges

How do dogs secrete pheromones::pheromones secreted mainly in urine but also from anal sacs onto faeces as they defecate

What information is communicated in canine pheromones::pheromones indicate age, sex, reproductive status, possibly level of excitement at the time of secretion

What are the signs of canine body language for face, eyes, ears, spine, posture, tail, mouth in a relaxed and stressed state
?

| Eyes          | Almond shape; normal pupils; soft eye               | Dilated pupils; hard eye; whale eye                    |
| Ears          | Soft lose; forward or midway on heads               | Far forward; out to the side; flat against head        |
| Spine/Posture | Flexible neck to tail                               | Rigid                                                  |
| Tail          | Level with topline; slightly above or below wagging | High above topline; tucked; wagging                    |
| Mouth         | Mouth open; lips long, soft                         | Mouth closed; lips-short, tense; snarl; lip lift; bite |



What is the canine ladder of aggression
?
1.  Yawning, blinking, nose licking
2.  Turning head away
3.  Turning body away, sitting, pawing
4.  Walking away
5.  Creeping, ears back
6.  Standing crouched, tail tucked under
7.  Lying down, leg up
8.  Stiffening up, stare
9.  Growling
10. Snapping
11.  Biting

What is the meaning of displacement behaviour, or appeasement behaviour
?
Displacement behaviour: normal behaviour appearing out of context, yawning before exams to displace stress
Appeasement behaviour: dog is trying to reduce likelihood of attack by looking small and that it is not a threat

What does the tail indicate in the dog
?
Wagging: can convey many meanings, willing to interact but not necessarily happiness
Position: different breeds can carry their tails at different heights
Types of wagging

## Preventing behavioural problems in puppies

What are some of the common behavioural problem causes
?
Genetic - poorly understood
Learned through negative experiences
- Lack of prior experience in fear or anxiety
- Experience elicits feat or anxiety due to previous event e.g. revisit vet after bad experience

What are the 3 key windows for preventing behavioural problems in dogs
?
1. Selection of an appropriate pet: Often vets don't get a lot of choice in this respect
2. Appropriate socialisation: 
3. Appropriate stimulation throughout life

When is the socialization period in dogs::3-12 weeks

What is the socialization period in dogs::A time at which dogs are more open to experiences, experiences during this period have a disproportionate experience. Whenever possible, remove animals when they are having a bad experience. Lack of exposure to a particular situation during this period predisposes to fear and anxiety of the stimulus later in life

When is typically the first vaccination::12 weeks

What messages are important to convey during the first vaccination appointment
?
12 week vaccination should focus a lot on behaviour as well as healthcare
Should be at least a 30 minute consult and include a puppy information pack with behavioural advice
REALLY important for the pup to enjoy the experience

What is the purpose of puppy pre-school::socialise the puppy so that it develops into an obedient and enjoyable pet

What is an alternative to puppy classes::Alternative to puppy classes where attending those is not possible or in addition to the classes

What are some things that dogs should be socialized to
?
Unfamiliar people of different sizes, genders and wearing different clothes
Children
Unfamiliar dogs
Other animal species e.g. cats
Different surfaces
Different weather conditions
Man-made objects and sounds e.g. brooms

Describe how and why we should socialize puppies with babies
?
Children are unpredictable
Provide a safe spot for the dog that the child cannot access
Owners must recognise when to move the child away

Describe how and why we should socialize puppies with children
?
OWNERS MUST SUPERVISE
Teach child how to talk and move around the puppy
The puppy chooses whether to approach and can back away if it wants to

Describe how and why we teach puppies to be alone
?
Puppies have often never been alone before
Gradual movement away from bed, room, house
Can use a crate during this process
Leave it something yummy and time-consuming to eat

Why are dog crates an important tool but what must we be sure of when using a dog crate
?
Provide a safe space for the puppy/adult dog
Allow safe transport
Allows easy confinement if required after a surgery
Dogs should not be crated for long periods e.g. a work day
Crates are not for punishment - it should have a positive association

## Behavioural Husbandry In Adult Dogs

What is behavioural husbandry in dogs::actions that owners can take to maximise the changes of their animal having good psychological wellbeing and behaviour

What are the general responses to poor husbandry in dogs::Exacerbation of other behavioural conditions e.g. separation anxiety, FAS, Development of stereotypic or compulsive behaviour

What are the key aspects of behavioural husbandry in dogs
?
Adequate physical exercise:  Inappropriate overactivity and poor manners (jumping up)
Adequate resources: resource guarding behaviours
Social requirements: fear due to lack of social experience, over-reacting when has chance for social interaction
Positive experiences (social and non-social): over-reaction to any experience


How does physical exercise impact behavioural husbandry in dogs
?
Varies a lot with age, breed and health (0 - 2 hours/day)
Walks the most common way of exercising dogs: often involves other social and non-social experiences
Running dog while owner runs or cycles: great cardiovascular but less enrichment
Duration/frequency of walks affected by:
- Owner time availability
- Behavioural issues while walking: pulling, overreacting to other dogs, reliability of recall

How does resources affect a dogs behavioural husbandry
?
Can be tangible, such as food and water, or intangible such as fun, comfort, stimulation
Dogs find different resources more important than other dogs at different times
Providing enough of the desired resources at the desired time, particularly with physical objects in multi-dog households, can help

What are the social requirements of dogs in terms of behavioural husbandry
?
Dogs are a social, pack species and like to socialise with both dogs and humans
Affected by different factors:
- Behaviour
- Inside vs outside housing (behaviour, coat type)

What are some potential positive social experiences for dogs
?
Meeting new dogs/people
Playing with dog and human friends
Positive training
Companionship
Important factors: temperament of dog (enjoy social interaction), age of dog, behaviour (manners) of dog, time

What are some examples of positive non-social experiences for dogs
?
Chewing/licking: bones toys, etc.
chasing/attacking games
Other environmental enrichment that provides interest e.g. sand

How can we improve the behavioural husbandry in a consult
?
Include social details on patient records
Encourage all dogs to walk into the consult room rather than be carried or dragged
Offer every dog food as it enters the consult room
Consider examining anxious/fearful dogs outside
Notice and reward good behaviour
Be aware of the language you use in communicating with the patient during a procedure
Do the least pleasant procedure last and ideally near an exit point
