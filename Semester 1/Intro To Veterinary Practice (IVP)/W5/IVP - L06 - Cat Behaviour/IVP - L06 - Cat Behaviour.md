# IVP - L06 - Cat Behaviour

## Sensing the World and Communicating Feelings
- Explain how a catâ€™s sensory experience of the world may influence its behavior in order to best understand the catâ€™s behaviour 
- Apply an understanding of the normal body language and behaviour of cats in order to interpret their interactions with humans and other animals
- Describe strategies to prevent development of problem behaviours to maximise the welfare outcomes for humans and cats

Provide an overview of a cats general sense of smell
?
Predominant sense in cats
Approximately 1000 times stronger than humans
Have a vomeronasal organ (like dogs) and demonstrate the flehmen response when they detect pheromones or other interesting scents
Curls the upper lip, inhales with nostrils closed holds the position for several seconds. This closes the normal airways and forces air through the vomeronasal organ
Strong odour sense partly contributes to some litter tray issues

Detail the importance of pheromones in cats
?
Pheromones are also important in cats and in cats and are released from many glands around the body (compared with dogs, which mainly release in urine and from anal glands)
The main reason cats headbutt and rub against objects and people is to leave their scent (pheromones from cheek and temporal glands)

How does scent affect a cats behaviour
?
Cats often rub heads as greeting and assessing each other
Use pheromones to tell age, sex, repro status, possibly level of excitement

Provide an overview of feline body language for eyes, ears, spine/posture, tail, and mouth in a relaxed and stressed state
?

| Tail          | Straight up, inverted U at tip, soft curve below topline; gentle back and forth movement | Curled around body or tucked; forceful movement, thumping |
| Mouth         | Closed                                                                                   | Open; panting; hissing; growling; spitting                |

## Kitten behaviour

What is the peak socialisation period in kittens and why is that important::2-7 weeks, important because the peak socialisation period may be over before they reach their new home

What are some common socialisation advice for kittens::carriers, car journeys, being handled, different types of litter, unfamiliar people of different sizes, genders, and wearing different clothes, children, unfamiliar cats, other animal species, objects and sounds within the home, outside (on a harness)

What are some key elements in the first vaccination consult
?
Gentle handling and lots of treats in vaccination consults
Role-modelling behaviour management
Behavioural advice and handouts and discussion from first consult with the kitten
Minimise restrain and do painful procedures last

What is the name for puppy preschools involving kittens and what are some common activities::kitten kindy, educate owners on common behaviour problems and management, handling and simple commands, processes and items involved in health checks and medication, use pill popper to dispense treats will be easier to medicate later

What is the importance of territory to cats
?
Home is the cat's core territory but may have wider areas it marks and roams across
Problems occur when the cat feels its territory is not safe from other animals/people
Ensure there are enough resources within the territory for the cat to feel comfortable

Describe litter management in cats
?
Inappropriate elimination major issue with cats so very important to educate owners
Size, number (cats + 1) and location of boxes are all important, as is the type of litter
Boxes should be cleaned at least daily
Do NOT use strong disinfectants as the smell may deter kittens/cats from using the box
Place kitten in box when they eat, drink or wake up - most likely times
Important to note that kittens will have accidents as they are learning, and it is important that the owners are aware

What is the importance of scratching behaviour in cats
?
Scratching really important in cats, but owners often complain about furniture
Must provide a scratching option that pleases the cat. Usually like old smelly posts that owners don't like
Foil can deter cats from scratching furniture

## Behavioural Husbandry of Cats

What are the key aspects of behavioural husbandry in cats
?
Adequate physical exercise
Adequate resources
Social requirements
Positive experiences (social and non-social)
General responses to poor behavioural husbandry
- Withdrawal (often not fully appreciated by owners)
- FLUTD
- Cat flu
- Compulsive behaviours e.g. grooming

What are the exercise requirements of cats:: Requirement varies a lot, owner input depends on indoor vs outdoor. Indoor needs vertical space and enrichment, toys like finishing lines, later pointers, outdoor enclosures

What are the main resources for cats
?
Food
Water
Resting/hiding places
Litter trays
Scratching posts

Describe feeding procedures in cats
?
Generally solitary eaters even in multi-cat households
Quiet area and not against a wall - like to be able to check for danger
Normally eat a lot of small meals each day - grazers
Food dispenser toys can provide good enrichment

Describe cats water preferences
?
Water - prefer large, shallow ceramic bowels or running water
Water away from food as live prey can contaminate water source - double bowls a problem

What are some important aspects when considering resting and sleeping places::resting/sleeping places that are high up with multiple exits, humans are also popular resting places

What are important aspects of social requirements for cats::cat society can vary from solitary to large colonies, can socialise with other cats or humans, human companionship has been shown to be important to cats

What are some important aspects to consider in the non-social experiences of cats
?
Need opportunities to express normal predation behaviour
Play behaviour often occurs in short, intense bursts similar to predation
Rotate toys
Places to mark e.g. scratching posts
Resting places with a view of garden/other activity provides good stimulation
