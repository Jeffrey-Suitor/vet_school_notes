### Original

Regular reproductive herd health programs are commonly implemented on year‐round calving dairy farms. These herd health programs are performed by veterinarians, and visits occur at regular intervals that may vary between farms. Veterinary visits usually include pregnancy testing, uterine and ovarian examinations, and monitoring of factors that affect reproductive performance including submission rates, oestrus detection efficiency, conception rates, transition cow management and nutrition.[1](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/avj.13042#avj13042-bib-0001) During herd health visits data are collected that enables monitoring of herd reproductive performance and health status.[2](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/avj.13042#avj13042-bib-0002) Herd reproductive performance is often compared to achievable performance targets, for example, a target 100‐day in calf rate (100DICR) of over 40% is driven by 80‐day submission rate (80DSR) and conception rate in year‐round calving dairy herds, with a target 80DSR of over 73%. Farmers can respond to analyses of reproductive data by prioritising management areas requiring change and to set about making improvements. Key management areas include implementing a 45‐day voluntary waiting period to reduce average days to first breeding and use of heat detection aids to increase heat detection efficiency. Rapid re‐breeding of non‐pregnant cows can be further facilitated through regular pregnancy testing visits to detect non‐pregnant cows and use of synchronisation strategies. Reconfirmation of 3 to 4‐month pregnancies also enables detection of early abortions to enable earlier re‐submission of cows that abort following early pregnancy testing. Ongoing analysis of reproductive data allows the farmer and veterinarian to continually review herd reproductive performance.[3](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/avj.13042#avj13042-bib-0003), [4](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/avj.13042#avj13042-bib-0004)

Regular reproductive herd health programs are commonly implemented on year‐round calving dairy farms.

Veterinary visits usually include pregnancy testing, uterine and ovarian examinations, and monitoring of factors that affect reproductive performance including submission rates, oestrus detection efficiency, conception rates, transition cow management and nutrition (McDougall et al. 2014). During herd health visits data are collected that enables monitoring of herd reproductive performance and health status (Smith et al. 2014). Herd reproductive performance is often compared to achievable performance targets, for example, a target 100‐day in calf rate (100DICR) of over 40% is driven by 80‐day submission rate (80DSR) and conception rate in year‐round calving dairy herds, with a target 80DSR of over 73%.
