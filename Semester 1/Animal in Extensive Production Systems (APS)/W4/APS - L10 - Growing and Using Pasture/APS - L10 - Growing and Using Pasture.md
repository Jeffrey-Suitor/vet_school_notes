# APS - L10 - Growing and Using Pasture

## Managing Pasture

What is the role of production manager in pasture growth, and why is pasture growth a key input for an enterprise
?
The extensive livestock production manager is essentially a manager of pasture and other supplementary feed inputs
Key driver of extensive livestock - growth and utilisation of pastures to supply livestock needs
Pastures can result in a range of direct and indirect issues that impact on animal health that may then involve veterinary assistance
Two critical terms: growth or production of pasture, utilisation of pasture
Both pasture growth and utilisation must be achieved to get maximum benefit

Provide an overview of how we measure pasture utilisation and consumption
?
Often referred to as kgDM/ha of pasture/utilised
Not always possible to effectively utilise pasture by livestock at certain times due to high growth
Can conserve some pasture as: Hay, Silage, Straw, Standing feed
Percentage consumption of pasture grown might be as low as 20% or as high as 80% (more intensive grazing e.g. dairy)

What are the differences in plant growth and regrowth patterns between temperature and tropical climates::Tropical plants use C4 pathway and temperate plants use C3. C4 plants include kangaroo grass, corn, sorghum, and the majority of plants used in south livestock production are C3.

What is the common pattern of in Australia 
?
| Season        | Plant Phase                    | Plant Stage                                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| Autumn        | Vegetative                     | Emergence                                    |
| Autumn        | Vegetative                     | Juvenile                                     |
| Autumn/Winter | Vegetative                     | Tilering                                     |
| Winter        | Vegetative/Reproductive        | Start of stem elongation (floral initiation) |
| Spring        | Reproductive                   | Flag (final) leaf emergency                  |
| Spring        | Reproductive                   | Spike emergence                              |
| Spring        | Reproductive/Grain development | Flowering                                    |
| Spring        | Grain development              | Grain fill                                   |
| Spring        | Grain development              | Ripening                                     |
| Summer        | Grain development              | Maturity                                     |

Provide an overview of plant phases and how they impact the energy and protein content
?
When plants are young, they are highly metabolized with a lot of energy
When plants are older, the amount of energy drops and the digestibility drops
Older plants can maintain stock but often young stock will need to be supplemented
Dry grass means that stock will lose weight because it doesn't have enough nutrients

How would we go about grazing perennial ryegrass
?
Common in Southern Australia
Along with Phalaris = dominant grass species
Regraze pasture once the third leaf almost fully emerged
Allows plants to accumulate root reserves
Maximises pasture harvest

T/F smaller mouth livestock are able to be more discriminatory when it comes to eating certain sections of plants::True

Why is digestibility important to foregut fermentors?
?
A significant difference in transit time for the animal (how long it takes to break down feedstuffs and journey through the body.
High digestibility means more energy can be extracted from each mouthful
It takes less time to digest each mouthful allowing more feed to be eaten
Therefore a high digestibility means more energy per unit and the animal can consume more per day
Once digestibility goes below 50% many animals cannot maintain their weight

What is the simplest way to improve pasture growth::irrigation, but it is not always an option

What is the most common way to improve pasture growth rates::chemical or natural fertilizers, superphosphate to apply extra phosphorous of nitrogen from a range of ammonium compounds

T/F Sowing new pasture is expensive and can take years to recoup costs::True due to costs of removing current plants. sowing seed and fertilizer and reducing grazing pressure on the area while plants establish

Describe fertilizer use in northern Australia in the cattle industry::relatively little fertilizer is used, grazing modification to manage pasture quality, and the density of water sources determines grazing pressure.

What is a cool burn::burning country when it is not tinder dry to reduce overall dry matter but not cause significant damage

## Feed Availability

Why is it important to measure feed and what are some methods for doing so
?
Need to be able to measure pasture height and estimate/guesstimate how fast it will grow
Also need to understand pasture components and quality
Methods of measurement:
- Eyeballing (experienced assessor), need to recalibrate regularly)
- Boot measure (physically walking a transect, calibrate on boot height)
- Pasture ruler (transect, method)
- Plate read/electronic (optimal as gives actual rapidly)
- Satellite (improving)
- Gold standard = cutting and drying grass

What are some of the benefits of satellite measurement of pasture growth::frequent, different measurements, simple, calibrate locally, FOO, NDVI (amount of rain)

How do we assess the quality of pasture and why is it important
?
Optimal measure = laboratory-based methods
Collect grass quadrats and assess for quality and quantity (can help to calibrate eyes to what you see and what is measured)
Pounds per acre verses kilograms per hectare (one acre = 0.405 ha, one pound = 0.454 kg) often express as kg/hg
May need a knowledge of imperial to converse with some farmers and in some countries (not yet converted to metric)
Generally, higher-quality pastures are vegetative. minimal weed and at least some legumes

Provide an overview of how we maintain the sustainability of pasture
?
Over summer annual pasture will die and not grow again until Autumn rain
Perennial grass stays over summer and may respond to summer rain
Important not to overgraze pasture to avoid damage to pasture and soil (water and wind erosion)
At what % cover should we stop grazing? Varies with soil and plant types
If less than shown need to decrease the stocking rate

What is it important to measure and forecast pasture growth
?
Pasture growth rate (PGR)
Along with measuring pasture height today, we need to be able to forecast
Create forecasts based on historical figures and current season and projected environmental variables in models
Some properties have rainfall and PGR data for many years, helpful for planning, when are maximal PGR periods on average and how long for
Satellite PGR imagery can achieve a similar graph without the on-farm work

How can models aid in predicting a pasture growth rate
?
Range of decision support tools
Rely on soil type, pasture levels, rainfall likelihood,
On right = likely predicted rainfall and can plot PGR
Key decision point = overstock/understock
Enterprise plan for dry season/wet season/drought

How do we convert from pounds per acre to kilograms per hectare::multiply by 1.12
