# APS - L12 - Monitoring Stock Condition, Water Intake, Macro and Microminerals

## Monitoring Stock Condition

Why is monitoring stock condition important::monitoring livestock condition score or liveweight is critical to assess performance over time. Particularly important when giving supplementary feed to ensure that what is being fed is meeting stock needs

How do we perform condition scoring in dairy cattle?
?
1. Look closely at the area between the tail and pins: Is it deeply sunken, sunken, slightly sunken, or filled in
2. If the area between the tail and pins is deeply sunken: Look inside of the pins, Are they hollow?
3. If the area between the tail and pins is sunken: Look at the backbone, is it flat or a bumpy sharp ridge? If the area between the tail and pins is slightly sunken or filled in: Look at the depression between the hip and pin. Is it U-shaped, shallow or flat

What is conditioning scoring
?
Condition scoring is a means of assessing the current weight of the animal
Condition scoring a cow at times is simpler than scoring a fleece-bearing animal as the fleece hides the animals score visually
Why is condition scoring useful:
- Quick to perform once educated
- Cheap - only need yards and then labour, low infrastructure costs
- Do need something to record information, ideally for each animal so can revisit. May just be a group average
- Needs to be repeated regularly e.g. every 3-4 weeks
- Assess how adequate diet is and if need more/less or different diet

Describe the process of weighing and how it impacts livestock assessment
?
Many livestock now have e-IDs from NLIS requirements, almost all in Victoria do (all sheep and cattle)
An enterprise has electronic scales and can link this with a panel or stick reader then can rapidly collect individual weight, particularly with a panel reader. Allows more regularity in monitoring as very rapid.
Higher infrastructure costs but can evaluate smaller variations (care with time off feed or when measured after a feed)
A condition score change in a Friesian might be 50kg whereas much smaller changes can be observed using weight

T/F A good shepherd will note general animal behaviour over time and any feed impacts. How well do animals come to feed and stay with the feed? This can precede changes in body weight

## Macrominerals, Microminerals, and Water

What are macrominerals
?
In a pre-gastric fermenter, macrominerals are generally required at the level of grams per kilogram per day in the diet
Trace elements (microminerals) needed at one hundred or one-thousandth of what level of macrominerals
Inadequate amounts of macrominerals lead to a range of conditions including hypocalcaemia (milk fever) and hypomagnesaemia (grass tetany)
Need correct balance of macrominerals, particularly parturition and lactation and when feeding grain (need to add Ca to grain-based diets)

What are some issues we have with trace elements in the feed?
?
Trace element disease is particularly associated with certain areas and soil types/climate
Results in plants having low available levels of the relevant trace element. Not always a low actual level sometimes it can be an interaction between elements.

Where are some issues with trace elements found in Victoria
?
Sandy areas: low cobalt, low copper
Northern Victoria: Low copper
Mountain region or sandy area: low selenium
High country: iodine deficiency, low copper
Usually caused by high rainfall which means stock are ingesting less soil

Provide a general overview of the importance of trace elements and how stock can become deficient
?
Vital for normal function
Excess amount: toxicity, if stock graze Se accumulating plants
Overdosing using trace elements (often in vaccines/drench)
Trace element deficiency is most common in winter/spring in high rainfall
Diagnosis can be visual (enlarged thyroid) but others need a blood test or production trials

### Water

Describe how the importance of water in livestock
?
The most important overall part of nutrition: an animal will die faster from lack of water than lack of feed (presuming inadequate water in the feed being consumed)
Livestock meet part of the water consumption via food: depends on DM %
In winter feed may only be 10% DM, so animals get water needs from grass consumption
Approximation for animal needs: 10% of body weight per day in water volume, 500 kg cow needs 50 litres of water, non-lactating
Stock need access when at water point: water flow or total volume is critical due to flock/herd social order

Provide an overview of potential issues with stock water quality
?
Salinity: mixing bore/dam, lactating animals more sensitive to salinity. Can dilute to make less salty
pH: Can dilute to make less salty
Toxins: blue-green algae
