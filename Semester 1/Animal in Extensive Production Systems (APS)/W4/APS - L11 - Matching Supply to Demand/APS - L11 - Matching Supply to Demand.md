# APS - L11 - Matching Supply to Demand

## Matching Feed Supply to Livestock Demand

How do we determine the stock requirements?
?
Use DSE
In many livestock enterprises, the same management schedule is used each year, particularly when the birthing period is
Presuming self-replacing enterprise, time of birth and duration of the birthing period of the herd/flock determines the DSE for the year
100 cow herd using same times post calving and retention of young, etc.

Why do we match stock requirements to pasture supply?
?
Aiming to try and match DSE requirements throughout the year as close as possible to pasture supply (unless there is a good reason to do something different)
The big challenge with autumn calving is the feed deficit during winter time. This would require significant supplementary feed and likely a drop in condition score to manage the herd
Shorter gestation/lactation period them more able to match short seasonal fluctuations more easily - hence why sheep are more commonly found in sheep/wheat zone where the growing season is shorter

How can we match DSE to animal requirements throughout the year?
?
Relevant DSE of animals in the herd or flock at a different stage of lactation/gestation (high requirement last third of pregnancy and lactation)
Duration of calving/lambing/kidding etc. A short joining period and therefore a short period for parturition across herd/flock means most animals are at a similar stage. Increasing the joining period t more cycles makes it harder to allocate feed properly.
Remember that livestock in a herd/flock will be at slightly different stages, not all sheep in a mob will lamb on the same day
Impact of sales - once sold no longer contribute to DSE
Category movement e.g. weaner to yearling

Sheep are introduced to the paddock when it is 2500kgDM/ha and removed when 1500kgDM/ha. If paddock 10 ha and pasture growing 50kgDM/ha/d. Assume each sheep eats 1kgDM/day. 750 wether in the paddock, how long can they stay?
?
1000 kgDM at start, 10 hc = 10000kg/DM. Each day weather eats 750 kg but the paddock grows 10 x 50 = 500 meaning they effectively eat 250kg daily. Wethers can stay in the paddock for 40 days

If starting at 1500 kgDM/ha and we want to get to 2500 kgDM/ha with a growth rate of 50kgDM/ha/d and 20kgDM/ha/d. How long will it take?
?
1000kgDM/ha needed
Divide by the number of days so at:
- 50 kgDM/ha/d = 20 days
- 20 kgDM/ha/d = 50 days

Why would farmers choose to use both sheep and grain in regards to pasture and feed availability::sheep/grain enterprises grazing wheat may be grazed in winter to reduce feed shortage on pasture, in addition, the stubble can be grazed over summer as pasture feed value declines

Why do different types of stock need a different lengths of grass::different classes of stock need different heights of pasture to support them, so they can eat enough grass (energy, protein)
Only have a certain amount of time (and bites) per day to consume grass as also need to chew and ruminate

What are some rules of thumb for stock needs?
?
Pasture above average quality then needs less height
Low digestibility pasture may not need even if > 20cm high
If pasture height is below maintenance then can't meet the needs
Useful for rapid pasture assessment in the paddock

## Supplementation

What is supplementation and what are the options to meet livestock demand when there isn't enough food
?
There will be times when not enough feed supply to match demand (unless the farm is very understocked)
Options:
- Sell livestock
- Agist livestock
- Lease additional farm/s
- Use body condition score on animals
- Supplementary feeding (feedlotting, containment feeding)

Why might we sell livestock on an enterprise?
?
To better match the demand
Enterprises often have different categories of livestock
Some are more saleable
Ideally, keep high priority - often youngest breeding animals (first/second lactation)
Beef cattle example:
- Initial sale animals -  any stock for fattening (steers, non-pregnant cows)
- Then likely older pregnant cattle (>5 y.o.)
- Then likely young female weaners up to 2 y.o.
- Retain as many breeding stock 2-5 y.o. in theory highest genetic merit (usually retain bulls unless not suitable for joining)
- For non-breeding enterprises will come down to maximizing total income from sales

Why might we agist or lease property?
?
Agistment = payment for a specified period. Usually on per animal basis over a short period (weeks or months)
Least = contract to manage the farm for a period of years (mostly). Generally, 3-5 years but varies from contract to contract
Drought = period of abnormally dry weather causing a serious hydrologic imbalance in the affected area
During drought enterprises may agist or lease land in areas not affected (or less affected) by drought, or where they have irrigation
Reduces workload of supplementary feeding
Can be challenging to assess how long stock might need to be away, also manage stock safety and biosecurity
How will animals be monitored on other enterprises and by who

Why would we allow animals to lose their body condition score
?
If animals are in good body condition score then it may be reasonable to allow them to lose some of this score during a difficult season
Unless a feed deficit is fixed rapidly then it is unlikely that this will be sufficient on its own
This is less applicable for young stock or lactating stock because they likely don't have these reserves

Why would an extensive production enterprise choose to supplementary feed
?
Relatively common process in high rainfall and sheep/wheat zones
Less common in pastoral areas as stock sold or moved before needing
Types of supplementary feed:
- Grains
- Hay and Silage
- Straw
- Other

## Supplementary Feed Types

### Grains

Provide an overview of grains as a supplementary feed type
?
Common feed type
Usually contain about 90% DM
Varying energy/protein
Cereal grains mostly similar energy and protein
Pulses have higher CP (even >30% e.g. lupins)
May use small % pulses with grain to improve CP

How do we adjust livestock to a grain diet and why
?
Grains with low acid detergent fibre (e.g. wheat) cause lactic acidosis if stock isn't used to them
Need gradual introduction over about 3 weeks
Generally a good idea to gradually change ANY feed
May be fed using a grain trailer or in a feedlot
Move grain to feed cart using augur (from silo)
Using trough may reduce wastage

### Hay and Silage

Provide an overview of hay and silage
?
Differing amount of DM:
- Hay generally 88-90%
- Silage ranges from 25-50%
Important $/MJ, not just look at price per tonne as fed
Significant variation in ME and CP depending on the quality of the original pasture
Need some roughage in the ruminant diet

### Straw
Provide an overview of straw
?
Similar to some late-season hays
Low in both energy and protein, high in fibre
Can be useful drought feed
May be used as bedding
Consumed with grain as part of stubble

### Other

Provide an overview of other novel feed types
?
Range of novel feed types (often as a small % of diet)
Potential risk around WHP/ESI (cotton trash)
Foods left over from human food production e.g. brewers grain

Provide an overview of how we decide what supplementary feed to use
?
A range of factors will impact the decision but often most important = is cost per megajoule ($/MJ)
Also must have the ability to transport, store and then feed the product e.g. may need a front-end load or grain feeder or silage grab
May be able to purchase in a different format, large round roll = 350kg, small square bale. = 25kg
Time and safety in feeding, who is responsible and when done
Often combine multiple feeds together to come up with the best value diet (least cost ration formulation) e.g. add lupins to predominantly oat diet
To work out $/MJ we need a feed test or be confident of the likely feedtest

Why is crude protein a particularly important measure for livestock
?
Crude protein is generally the second most important measure after energy
Particularly important for young and lactating stock
Protein is also important to allow the stock to maximise intake
