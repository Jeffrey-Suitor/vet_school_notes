In 2019/20, about 1.4 million cows from about 5,000 farms produced nearly nine billion litres of milk. The average milk production per cow is 6,170 litres/ lactation.

There are eight dairying regions in Australia, each with their own conditions and requirements.

The management systems on dairy farms can be divided into 4 basic types based on their calving pattern:

1.  **Spring calving**, where most cows are calved within a single six-week period from July to November
2.  **Autumn calving**, where most cows are calved within a single six-week period from March to June
3.  **Year-round calving**, where joining and calving occur all year
4.  **Split or batch calving**, where more than one separate six-week intensive calving period is required to calve the majority of cows

In addition, there are two other farm sectors that are involved heavily in the dairy industry although they do not actually milk cows:

-   Heifer rearing farms, where cows are not milked, but heifers are reared under contact to typically more than one dairy farm. Heifers are reared from either birth or weaning up to the point of first calving as a 2-year-old
-   Bull beef farms, which buy dairy bull calves either before or after weaning and raise them entire for sale as bull beef around 24 months of age.

## Calving patterns employed

The major factor influencing animal movements and feeding practices within the dairy industry is the calving pattern employed. As discussed in week 1, the choice of calving pattern determines the milk flow, herd demand for feed and the timing of animal movement into and out of the milking herd.

The vast majority of dairy cattle in Australia are grazed on pasture and the amount and reliability of the pasture produced influences supplementary feeding practices and the movement of animals. Decisions regarding the calving pattern are strongly influenced by the seasonality of pasture production. This is in turn determined by the rainfall pattern, access to irrigation, and cost of imported feedstuffs such as grain. Irrigation provides pasture growth through the dry summer in southern Australia and this can effectively eliminate the summer feed deficit.

## Dairy industry regions

The dairy industry in Australia is mostly located in 8 clusters or regions:

-   Northern Riverina (VIC)
-   Western Victoria
-   Gippsland (VIC)
-   Tasmania
-   Southern & Central NSW
-   Northern NSW & Southern Queensland
-   Far North Queensland
-   South Australia
-   Western Australia

The unique climatic and geographical characteristics help determine which management systems and calving patterns predominate in each region.

The website [Dairying for TomorrowLinks to an external site.](https://www.dairyingfortomorrow.com.au/), a practical natural resource management (NRM) program to secure the future of Australia’s dairy farms contains an excellent summary of the differences between the different dairying regions.

## Rotary dairy and herringbone dairy

Another way in which dairy farms differ is in the type of dairy shed in which the cows milked. The two main types of dairy in current use are the **rotary dairy and herringbone dairy.** Larger herds tend to have rotary dairies which, whilst being more expensive to set up, allow large numbers of cows to be milked efficiently by a minimum number of staff.

The Australian Milk Quality Awards recognize the lowest 5% of farms across Australia based on annual average bulk milk cell count (BMCC).
