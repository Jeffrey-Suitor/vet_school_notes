## Fertility and Australian dairy farms

In week one, you learned about the importance of fertility for a profitable dairy farm. Good herd fertility means the farmer can:

-   Match the cows calving pattern to pasture growth (in seasonal herds)
-   Have less empty (non pregnant) and/or carryover cows
-   Have less need for replacements - which means they can select which cows to keep in the herd, or diversify by breeding dairy-beef

But achieving good fertility is really complicated. No one aspect can be a "magic bullet". The key factors a farmer must consider are:

1.  Calf/heifer management
2.  Nutrition/BCS
3.  Heat detection
4.  Genetics
5.  Sires
6.  Mating strategies
7.  Optimising A.I.
8.  Bull management
9.  Cow health

Watch the following video about improving genetics for increased profitability.

In the 4-minute video, Victorian dairy farmers Jared and Courtney Ireland share tips for breeding a high genetic merit dairy herd on a budget.

## Alternative ways to improve fertility

There are other ways to improve fertility and therefore profitability on dairy farms.

In a study done by University of Melbourne veterinary postgraduate in 2014, which examined crossbreeding in Australian dairy herds, it was found that crossbred cows got in calf faster and survived longer in the herd than purebred cows. An economic model developed as part of the study indicated that a well-managed crossbred dairy herd could be more profitable than a purebred herd.
