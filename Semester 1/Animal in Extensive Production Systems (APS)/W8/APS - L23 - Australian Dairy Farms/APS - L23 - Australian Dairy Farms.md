# APS - L23 - Australian Dairy Farms

What are the 4 types of dairy calving patterns?
?
Spring calving: most cows in a single six-week period from July to November
Autumn calving: where most cows are calved within a single six-week period from March to June
Year-round calving: joining and calving occur all year
Split or batch calving: one separate six-week intensive calving period is required to calve the majority of cows

What are the two farm sector that do not milk cows
?
Heifer rearing farms
Bull beef farms

What drives calving decisions::Primarily pasture growth

What are the 8 dairy regions
?
Northern Riverina (VIC)
Western Victoria
Gippsland (VIC)
Tasmania
Southern & Central NSW
Northern NSW & Southern Queensland
Far North Queensland
South Australia
Western Australia

What are the two types of dairies
?
rotary (large herds)
herringbone (smaller)

## Australian Dairy Farms

What are the most commonly milked animals in Australia::cattle, goat, sheep

Outline dairy farm ownership
?
Owner-operators, people who own run
Share-farmers
- Varying arrangements
- The owner often owns the land and fixed infrastructure +/- some or all of the cows
- Share farmer often owns some of the machinery +/- all of the cows and provides labour
- Profits shared between owner and share-farmer
Offsite owners (corporate or individual) employing a manager and other staff

Outline the cows on dairy farms
?
279 cows average
An increasing number of large herds of 1000 or more
Herds may be cows of the same breed, a different breed, cross-breeds
Stud animals vs commercial milkers

Outline the seasonality of dairy milk production::Victoria + Tasmania = spring milk peak

What type of calving pattern do Victoria and Tasmania employ::Seasonal calving

Outline seasonal production systems
?
Seasonal calving - cows calve over a restricted period
Benefits
- Make use of available feed (grass growth)
- Utilise different prices throughout the year
- Efficient utilisation of labour
Disadvantages - what to do with a non-pregnant cow
- Cull cows
- Carrying over dry cows
- Milking stale cows over a dry period
- Genetic improvement of herd halted

Outline year-round production systems
?
Cows calve throughout the year
Benefits
- Ensures year-round milk supply sought by some milk factories (NSW and Qld) most factories now require processing all year
Disadvantages
- Prolonged inter-calving interval leads to reduced production (cow spends less time at peak)
- Reduced numbers of calves/lifetime (less genetic gain)
- Workload spread over the whole year

Outline split/batch calving
?
Two or more calving periods (Spring/Autumn)
- Spring group is often larger to maximise the use of pasture availability
- Can bring benefits of year-round milk payments
- Can allow "carrying over" cows who do not get in calf to next group

What are the types of dairies
?
Walk through dairy (older, smaller dairies)
Herringbone (newish, all side is milked together, the middle area is where a farmer works)
Rotary dairy (slow-moving circular, for large dairies)

## Inputs and Outputs

What is the aim of a dairy farm business::maxmimise profit by efficiently selling milk and stock?

What are the variable costs::Changes with herd sizes

How do we describe financial dairy frame performance::Dairy farm monitoring project

Outline benchmarking of dairy farms
?
Profit is the sum of many small parts
Can compare farms we can detect inefficiencies
Farms vary in size
Gross margin or EBIT
- per Ha
- per cow
- per kg milk solid

Outline the income of a farm
?
Milk income
- Farmers are paid for milk but charges "levies" of about 0.75%
- Usually described as a "Net of Levies"
- Often described "per Kg Milk Solids"
Stock income
- Sale of cows
- Sale of surplus stock
- Dary beef, stud animals, bull sales
Other income
- Off-farm income
- Change in stored assets (feed)

How can you maximise income
?
Get paid more for milk
More cows
Production per cow

What are the variable costs on a dairy farm
?
herd costs
shed costs
feed costs

Outline herd costs
?
Calf rearing
Heifer rearing
Reproduction
- Bull management
- A.I
- Pregnancy diagnosis (vet)
Animal Health Costs
- Vet costs
- Nutrition management
Other management tasks
- Disbudding
- Ear tagging

Outline shed costs
?
Electricity
Detergents
Teat spray
Milking machine maintenance

Outline feed costs
?
Hay 
Silage
Mixer wagon petrol
Fertilizer
Cropping
The main cost for dairy farms
Rarely want to minimise often want to optimise

How do you optimise costs
?
Minimise shed costs
Optimise herd costs
production per cow
optimise feed costs
Fertility
Good management

The Australian Milk Quality Awards recognize the lowest 5% of farms across Australia based on annual average bulk milk cell count (BMCC).

Dairy farmers are paid for good-quality milk. They will often be paid a premium if their BMCC sits below a certain band. This impacts profitability because the milk costs the same to produce, but the income will be higher with better milk quality.

## Milk Quality

Outline the composition of milk
?
Water 87%
Butterfat 3-4%
Protein 3-3.5% (90% casein, 20% whey proteins)
Carbohydrates 4.9% (lactose)
Minerals (Calcium, Phosphorus)
Vitamins (Vitamin A)

What determines milk quality
?
Butterfat + protein = milk solids
Bulk milk cell count BMCC (really important)
Bacterial count (Bactoscan, thermoduric)
Freezing point
Residues
Sediment

Outline milk quality and profitability
?
Bufferfat + protein = milk solid -> base payment
Incentives -> Produce > 43% in 'off-season, produce more than prev 2-year average, incentive for larger vats
Penalties -> BMCC: inflammatory cells, Bactoscan: bacteria, thermoduric: heat resistant organisms, inhibitory substances: antibiotics other chemicals, temp: at collection <5C
Base + Incentives - Penalties

How can you improve milk quality::nutrition, genetics (jerseys produce more milk solid than freisans), good management

Outline mastitis and BMCC
?
Inflammation of the mammary gland, typically due to bacterial infection
Most economically important diseases to dairy industry
- Reduced milk production
- Loss of BCS
- Poorer milk quality milk (reduced payment) due to increased BMCC
- Cull cattle
- Cost of treatment
- Antibiotic use
Clinical mastitis also impacts animal welfare
Good prevention, management and appropriate treatment of mastitis are important

What are the two forms of mastitis?
?
Sub-clinical
- No visible changes in milk, udder or cow
- Decreased milk production
- Decreased milk quality - Cell count (>250 000/ml)
- Not treated during lactation (generally) - "Dry cow therapy" (Antibiotics at end of lactation)
- Cull?
Clinical
- Obvious cahnges in milk +/- udder +/- cow
- Mild to severe/fatal
- Treat with antibiotics
- Withhold milk because unfit for human consumption
- Cull?

How can management prevent mastitis?
?
Milking / milking machine management
Good hygiene and other preventative measures
Appropriate treatment of affected animals

Outline herd testing
?
Processors evaluate bulk milk quality at each collection (bulk milk testing)
Farmers can also monitor individual cows periodically for
- Milk production
  - Litres
  - BF (kg and %)
  - Protein (kg and %)
- Individual cow cell count (ICCC)
- subclinical mastitis detectoin
Also provides farmer with repro/fertility data
40% of Australian herds "herd test"

What are some key metrics of fertility
?
Match the cows calving pattern to pasture growth (in seasonal herds)
Have less empty (non pregnant) and/or carryover cows
Have less need for replacements - which means they can select which cows to keep in the herd, or diversify by breeding dairy-beef

What are some key areas for good fertility
?
Calf/heifer management
Nutrition/BCS
Heat detection
Genetics
Sires
Mating strategies
Optimising A.I.
Bull management
Cow health

T/F cross breeds perform better fertility wise::True
