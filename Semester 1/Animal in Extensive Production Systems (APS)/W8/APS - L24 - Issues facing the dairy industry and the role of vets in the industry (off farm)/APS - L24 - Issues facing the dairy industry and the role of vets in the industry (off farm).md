# APS - L24 - Issues facing the dairy industry and the role of vets in the industry (off-farm)

How has Northern Victoria farm profitability changed::Down from 5.2% to -1.7%

How does trade impact Australian dairy::Dependent no trade so any change destabilises that and destabilises farms

What are some social license issues for dairy farms::bobby calves, calving induction

Outline the climate challenges to dairy farms
?
If you can't grow or farm or it's too costly farms go out of business
Drought
- Need to buy feed and water
- Increasing costs of water
Flooding events
Fires
Climate change
- Short-term increase in variability of climatic conditions
- Long-term increase in temperatures
  - Impacts on cows - heat stress
  - Impact on water supplies - increased cost of water, decreased availability
  - Impact pasture growth - longer, drier summer; warmer winters with fever frosts

Outline the economic issues of dairy farms
?
Low milk prices, driven by supermarket competition (culminating in 1$ milk)
Overall, world dairy prices don't change much
Australia's share in the global dairy market fell from 16% to 6%
Increasing costs of water in irrigated regions
Supplementary feed needs and prices

## Political and Social Issues

Outline how tariffs impact Australian dairy export
?
Depends on the relationship between Australia and country
Lower prices with China
Percentage of price or specific amount per L
Can be a quota on the product which limits how many fall under these agreements

Outline the social license to operate in the dairy industry
?
Perception of stakeholders that the company and industry are ok to operate
Hard to build trust and easy to lose
This means that the industry must conform to societal views even if it is driven by emotion
Live animal export
- How the journey on ships is
- How they are treated once they reach the destination
Public perception of management practices
- bobby calves, addressed by promoting these calves as dairy beef
- phasing out calving induction, pledging to phase out by 2022
Antimicrobial stewardship
- Antimicrobial resistance is a huge threat, we need to prevent antimicrobial resistance
Environmental impact/sustainability
- Australian dairy is 12% of agriculture greenhouse gas, 2-3% of national emissions, the largest source of both methane (40%) and nitrous oxide (47%)

## Animal Welfare Issues

Outline cattle welfare issues
?
Cows
- Lameness 
- Mastitis
- Nutrition
- Problems around calving
- Heat stress
Calves
- Bobby calves
- neonatal disease
- Disbudding
Transport

Outline lameness in dairy cattle
?
Number 1 welfare concern for dairy worldwide
Incidence in Australia is probably lower than in the Northern hemisphere
The most common risk factors for lameness in Aus/NZ are management related = preventable

Outline heat stress in dairy cattle
?
High-producing cows are susceptible to heat stress because of heat production from milk production
Above 25C needs to use active cooling mechanisms
This can lead to increased incidences of disease, lameness, and reduced production
Higher humidity means that heat stress can be felt at lower temperatures
Related to the temperature humidity index
Moderate (THI 75)
- Provide share
- increased energy diet
- Sprinklers at PM milking
- Ensure access to cool drinking water
High (THI 78)
- Minimise walking distance to dairy
- Utilise coolest paddocks
- High-quality pastures at night
- Sprinklers AM/PM milking
- Delay milking time
Severe (THI 82+)
- Use fans to increase air movement
- Alter diet if appropriate
- Provide access to dams

Outline the transport of animals
?
Must be good to load
How long they can be off feed and water
Bobby's calves are a special case

Outline disbudding
?
Veterinary disbudding
- Heavy sedation/pain relief
- Local anaesthetic
- Antiseptic spray
- Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
- $8 per calf

What is the most important thing to reduce cow heat stress::provide water, provide shade

Keeping dairy cows cool in hot weather is not only important as an animal welfare issue but also a profit issue and a greenhouse gas issue. Cool cows produce more milk and less greenhouse gases.

How to prevent calf lameness
?
Following order vs milking order
Need space to be able to adjust and allow dominant behaviour
1.8-2 meters per cow, 1.3 meters per cows
Don't come out the front and spook cows in the yard
Never use dogs with dairy cattle
Keep a consistent routine
Don't force cows to move fast

What is the most common cause of pressure in yards
?
Improper use of the backing gate
1. 2 rows of cattle are moved
2. < 12 meters per minute in round yards and < 6 meters per minute in square yards
3. 5-second rule limit on forward gate movement
