Describe the mating groups for deer
?
Single sire, one male in with a group of females
So that the males don't fight

External parasites
Pour on drench
Still, be aware of the withholding period

## Deer Reproduction

Outline hard vs velvet antler::Velvet in the growing stage and covered with a velvety coating, hard antler calcified and used for fighting

Outline the change in androgenic hormones in deer::Effectively a castrate most the year when breeding season comes they become testosterone-charged and increase in size and attitude, muscle around the neck, more aggression, roaring to mark presence, defend their group of females and ward off other males, the breeding season also called the roar

Describe the male reproductive physiology of the rut
?
Neck hypertrophy
"Roar" - Sound of roar
Flehmen
Antler calcification
Aggression/territory marking
30% body weight loss
March-July
Good to have a vacant paddock between stags because they may fight over fences

Outline the species differences in male reproduction deer
?
Less photoperiod influence in tropical species
Reds move with and protect the harem (be very careful with the Red stage)
Follow occupies stationary territory with Harem
Male:female ratio of 1:30 is recommended for most breeds

Outline female reproduction in deer
?
Seasonally polyoestrus with very distinct photoperiod effects in temperate species
Puberty reached at 15 months (second autumn)
Most conceive at first oestrus of the rut
Fertility peak at 5 years
2nd and subsequent offspring heavier
| Breed  | Oestrus length (days) | Gestation period (days) |
| ------ | --------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Red    | 18.8                  | 233 +/- 4.5             |

## Deer Production Outputs

What is velvet harvesting?
?
Amputation of live antler prior to calcification from male deer
Must be carried out under veterinary supervision with appropriate analgesics
By a farmer through the National Velvet Accreditation Scheme

Outline antlerogenesis
?
The annual casting of buttons (or antlers), regrowth and calcification
Change in daylight length
Increased daylight = decreased testosterone = cast and new growth
Decreased daylight = increased testosterone = shedding of velvet and calcification
Cast - July/Aug
Growth - Sept/Jan
- 3-4 months
- Nutrition very important
Maturation - Jan/Feb
Primary harvest - Oct/Nov
Date of cast-date of harvest very predictable
Up to 2 harvests from mature stags

Outline the value of velvet
?
not an aphrodisiac per se
Promotion of good health and prevention of illness
Lab assessments - variable results

Does deer velvet have scientific value::No

Describe the velvet harvesting technique
?
Paddock
Yards
Crush
Need quiet, well-handled stag
Group according to button drop
Environmental temperature - cool
Sedatives can make them too hot
Sedation
Analgesia
Haemostasis
- Racing bike inner tube
- No more than 30 mins
- Place below pedicle
Amputation
- Saw/secateurs
- Start laterally
- carefully not to rip velvet
Aftercare
- Always bleeds
- Fly repellents

What are the legal aspects?
?
National Velvet Accreditation Scheme - 3-part course
1. Self-assessment
2. Theory (open book exam - 75% pass)
3. Practical assessment (by a veterinarian)
Given accreditation for 3 year period
A farmer must submit an annual report
Annual vet visit (vet must keep a register of drugs prescribed)
