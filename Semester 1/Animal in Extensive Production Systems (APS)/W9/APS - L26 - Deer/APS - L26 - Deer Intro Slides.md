In 1997/98 there were nearly 200,000 farmed deer in Australia, but after a prolonged drought from 2002 numbers decreased and by 2010/11 (when the last industry statistics were recorded) numbers had fallen to 43,856 deer on 196 farms.

In 2010, most deer farms were in Victoria (35%), South Australia (24%) and New South Wales (12%), with red deer making up 48%, followed by fallow deer (44%), and smaller numbers of rusa, elk, sambar, chital, sika cross, hog deer and other species.

In 2010, the industry had a small number of large farms and many small farms- the 10 largest farms had 1000 or more deer, and represented about 41% of the total industry, while the smallest 100 farms comprised less than 10% of the total. Farmers cited lack of profitability (41%), abbatoir costs and access (18%), and lack of markets (10%) as the reasons for leaving or considering leaving the industry.

Within our region, the New Zealand deer industry is very well developed, with approximately 1.2 million animals comprising around half of the worldâ€™s farmed deer population. The majority of farmed deer in New Zealand are red deer (including red/wapiti hybrids). The terminology of farmed deer classes varies with species.
