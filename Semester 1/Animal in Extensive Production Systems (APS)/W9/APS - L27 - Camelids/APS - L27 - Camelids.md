The most common SAC in Australia is the Alpaca
Vicuna and Guanaco are only present in zoos with the majority still in South America
350 000 Vicuna
1 million Guanaco

Outline Llama
?
Predominantly used as a pack animal in South America
Also fibre production (poorer quality than alpaca)
Guard animal (up to 150kg weight)
Meat
In Australia, usually kept as a pet or occasionally for home spinning fibre (jumper production)
Small numbers

Describe Alpaca
?
South America Camelids
Always domesticated
Significantly smaller than the Llama, they weigh up to 70kg (not much more than your average sheep)
Live 15 to 20 years (longer than a sheep)
Gestation length - 335 days (approximately)
Height is 1 meter at the shoulder
Birth is usually rapid and in the morning (probably as a result of the previous environment)

What are the two types of alpaca?
?
Huacaya
- Most common in Australia
- Soft, fluffy-looking animal (fleece has a similar growth pattern to Merino)
Suri
- Less common
- Fleece has a growth pattern more like a Leicester Sheep

Describe the worldwide alpaca herd
?
Approximately 3-4 million Worldwide
95$ in Peru
80% HUacaya
Export of fibre from Peru worth 147 million USD

Outline the Australian Alpaca industry
?
Began in the late 1980s in Chile
In Australia, alpacas farmed mainly for fibre production, with small markets for meat and leather
Alpacas thrive under similar conditions to merino sheep
Alpacas are considered green as their soft feet cause minimal damage to fragile soils, they do not suffer from flystrike or require mulesing and have similar nutritional requirements to sheep
Speculative (still a growing industry)
Still a relatively small industry (compared to sheep)
Moderate risk
Predicted to reach over a million by 2021

How much does an alpaca cost
?
Large variation in prices
Alpacas for sale listed on eAlpaca.com.au
Males not wanted in the breeding process are sometimes sold to sheep farmers to act as lamb protectors (against foxes and dogs) for as little as 300
Breeding females or males may command prices up to tens of thousands of dollars depending on their quality

Outline alpaca fleece
?
Australian Alpaca Fleece Ltd
Largest Australian alpaca fibre trader
Fleece lots sold to processors in Aus, NZ and Incalpaca Peru

What are the current fleece values
?
Very difficult to find values cw sheep wool industry
No prices published by AAFL
Private enterprise "Australian Alpaca Yarn" last updated their prices 2017

Outline meat production
?
About 11,250,000 kgs of alpaca meat are produced in Peru annually (most is eaten on the farm rather than sold commercially)
In Australia, meat production is currently small
Alpaca meat has a protein level of 21-25%, low in cholesterol, 5.5-6%, and low in fat

## Alpaca Fleece

How large is shorn alpaca fleece::1.4-4kg

What is the alpaca DSE::1 and lactating is 2

T/F alpacas should be supplemented by vitamin D::True, it fortifies colostrum for cria, 6000 iu/kg for all alpacas <3 years old

How do we remove the alpaca fighting teeth::Obstetrical wire

The first mating of alpaca females occurs at what size::greater than 45 kg and over 12 months of age

When do male alpacas reach sexual maturity::1-3 years

T/F male and female cria are generally run separately once weaned::True at 3-6 months

Outline shearing of Alpaca
?
Alpacas are not shorn like sheep
They are tied up (front and hind legs)
Low % grease
Once per year (usually in Spring)
1.5-4k fleece

Outline alpaca disease problems/prevention
?
Less likely to get fly struck compared to sheep (lower grease content)
Most are vaccinated against tetanus, pulpy kidney, black vaccine
Can also give 7 in 1 (including leptosporosis)
Johnes disease
Internal parasites (faecal egg counts)
Fighting
Trimming toenails (if necessary)

Outline alpaca behaviour
?
Dung piles
Spitting (rumen content)
Kicking

What type of alpaca attacks people::intact male

Outline reproduction in alpacas
?
Gestation is about 335 days (11 months) little bit less than a horse
The physical act of copulation and the stud's ogling noise induces ovulation
Female is either receptive to mating or non-receptive to mating
Mate at any time of the year
Mating lasts for 5 to 65 minutes
Done sitting down
Pregnancy check - failure to sit, "spit-off" (weekly post-joining), ultrasound scanning

Outline AI in camelids
?
Collection not well established (long copulation times make it difficult)
Viscous semen makes storage difficult
Single mating (or insemination) is not very successful

Outline embryo transfer in Alpaca::Dr Jane Vaughan has provided "Canchones" alpaca studs with >30 cria through E.T.

What will the Alpaca industry look like in 10 years?
?
Improved genetics
- Lower micron
- Higher production per head (and per hectare)
Less labour per animal
More commercial focus rather than current stud stock
Could go the same way as the Ostrich industry
