# APS - L35 - Small Ruminant Welfare and Regulation

Outline the cruelty to animals regulations in sheep and goat
?
Transport
Prohibited vehicles
Pain relief for mulesing and overgrown wool on sheep - must administer pain relief
Fruit tree netting
Electrical devices including electronic collars
Traps and oxy-LPG devices
Rodeos
Use of animals in scientific procedures and teaching

What are the sheep and goats' standards and guidelines
?
General responsibilities (education and application of knowledge)
Feed and water requirements
risk management - environment, predation, disease
Appropriate facilities and equipment (doesn't need to be new)
Handling and husbandry
Tail docking and castration (disbudding/dehorning goats)
mulesing (for sheep)
Breeding management
Dairy management (goats)
intensive production systems
Humane killing

Outline sheep and goats, standards and guidelines
?
Base-level requirements that MUST be achieved (standards)
Guidelines are what most of the industry achieve
Variation across the country makes this difficult

Outline the standard transport and guidelines
?
Fit to load guidelines
- Can maintain weight on all 4 legs
- Injury or distress
- See well enough to walk
- Late pregnancy or too young
- Enough water in advance

What is the role of the veterinarian within POCTA and what standards and guidelines?
?
Veterinarians have an important role in a number of situations
Private practitioner
- Advise on optimal methods/drugs for a range of husbandry
- General production system advise - disease, risk mitigation (predation, weather), vaccination, drench
Government vet or RSPCA - investigation/legal
Industry - products to improve husbandry
Research - better options for husbandry and define welfare

Outline mulesing and sheep
?
Sheep mulesed to remove wrinkles
Can also be achieved over a number of generations through genetic variation
In Victoria MUST use analgesics at the time of mulesing
1-5 score, prefer 1 and 2 because of the low likelihood
Tightens up the skin to remove folds
Trisulfan is a post-surgical local anesthetic
Numbocaine
Meloxicam
In the 1930s we didn't have products to protect sheep
More sheep are moving towards unmulsed flocks by genetic selection which takes time
Interm program or pain reflief

Outline live sheep export
?
Probably seen as the most controversial Australian sheep issue
Sheep sent from Australia to the middle east
Mainly from Western Australia
Since 2000 there has been a large decrease
Exporters have to a heat stress management plan for each voyage
Reduction in mortality from 2% o 1%
Stocking densities calculated using allometric principles
Independent verification of pen air turnover (PAT)
10% extra space for horned rams
Kuwait to be the first port of unloading for the vessel if it is one of the destination ports
All vessels to be installed with automated watering systems
Provision of additional bleeding

Outline mortality on an animal welfare basis
?
Mortality = crude measure of animal welfare - the overall mortality rate for sheep during sea transport to all destinations during 2018 was 0.46% (5202 mortality in 1.14 million sheep exported)
Average duration 18 days
**Welfare impacts prior to mortality**
Important note to consider just average annual loss
Winter tends to have higher mortality because sheep experience a larger change in temperature

Outline castration and docking and marking procedures of small ruminants
?
Almost all lambs are castrated and docked - except some live export lambs are not (the market requires entire rams with tails)
Lambs docked to reduce fly issues
Rams castrated for meat quality, aggression, unwanted pregnancy
Painful procedure however it is carried out, just because there is no blood is NOT equivalent to no pain
Analgesia/anaesthesia - new products on the market, Numnuts to put local anaesthetic into the correct position, trisolfen if in conjunction with mulesing, NSAID for pain relief

Outline education of small ruminant welfare
?
Ensuring the next generation educated in animal needs to meet S and G requirements around education
Not just always "continue how always done" (not logical to expect positive change if that is what is needed)
Social license - changes in a range of livestock management procedures, more science input, stronger AVA policy on live export

Outline pharmaceuticals for small ruminants
?
Fewer products than bovine due to a smaller market
RDCs are funding a lot of this research
Off-label use particularly for goats
Hard to determine WHP and ESI as there is no known period so the best guess

Outline the important considerations when transporting stock and when they are unfit to load
?
Not strong enough for the journey
Can't bear weight on all legs
Emaciated or dehydrated
Signs of injury or distress
Likely to be caused increased pain or distress during transport
Blind in both eyes
In pregnancy

What is the maximum time off water::48 hours, minimum spell of 36 hours, 24-48 for calves kids and lambs and pregnancy and a minimum spell period of 12 hours

## Funding and research

What are the two ways research is done::Animal health companies or via research and development groups such as MLA, AWI, and Agrifutures?

What are the two main groups that give input to MLA::Sheep Producers Australia (SPA) and the Goat Industry Council of Australia (GICA)

What are the two levies sheep producers pay
?
A transaction at point of sale of a lamb or sheep
A wool levy on sale of wool

RDCs may target areas companies unlikely to cover
