# APS - L34 - Small Ruminant Nutrition and Outputs

## Outputs

What is the range of sheep meat systems::300-500 g/day, growing faster means they need higher DSE

What are carryover lambs::Didn't meat the prime lamb weight and so carried over

Outline the order of carcass weights of sheep meat::Middle East Light Export < Trade < Domestic Food Service < Heavy export

Outline the order of fat depth of sheep meant: Middle East Light Export < Trade = Domestic Food Service < Heavy Export

T/F Australian lamb export fat is higher than New Zealand export::True because Australian export is US vs NZ which is UK.

Why don't we make lambs as fast as possible::Expensive to the fat is often trimmed and while not wasted it is a lesser-value product so abattoirs specify what they want

T/F bringing sheep to a sale yard still means the farmer is guaranteed to get abattoir feedback::False

Outline goat meat consumption
?
Most widely consumed meat in the world
Less than 45% dressing percentage, 14-16kg carcase means 32-35kg
Range goats checked for weight and meeting abattoir target carcass range pre-transport (kept if too low) - similar dressing percentage to sheep depending on meat goat infusion

Outline wool output in sheep
?
The wool output varies with the breed of sheep
Merino
- As micron increases GFW also tends to increase
- Lower micron lower GFW, higher micron higher GFW
- Medium wool micron fleece weights and about 5kg
Longwool British breeds
- Higher wool production, low value
Short-wool British breeds
- Lower wool production - 2-3kg per animal

Outline mohair from Angora goats
?
Angora goats are shorn twice a year
Typically yield an adult fleece of between 5kg and 6kg per annum
120-150 mm, lustrous and resilient luxury fibre, which can be blended with other natural or synthetic fibres to give texture and lustre to finished fabric
Fibre diameter varies between 20 and 40 microns and increases as the goat ages
4.5 kilo T production worldwide in 2013, reduced from 6 kT in 2004

Outline cashmere goats
?
11-20 microns (similar to finer-end Merino)
Generally less than 500g per animal but depends on selection pressure on cashmere production

Outline sheep milk in Australia
?
5500 sheep are milked in Australia on 13 commercial farms
Annual production is about 550000 L of milk of which half is used for yogurt and cheeses.
100L per head

Outline goat milk in Australia
?
4L of milk per day
68 dairy goat farms and 15 goat milk factories 
Lactation lasts 300 days, 2-3L per day, 600-100L lactation

What is the RDC in the sheep/goat industry
?

## Nutrition

Outline nutrition in small ruminants
?
Small ruminants have lower incisors and upper dental pad
Reticulum (honeycomb), rumen (paunch), omasum (bible), abomasum
Well-adapted to trees and shrubs

Outline small ruminant nutrition
?
Ruminants, in general, are able to take lower quality nutrition and produce fibre, milk, and meat whereas monogastric need high-quality feed
Goat browsers can lead to issues with parasite pickup where goats grazed in the same way as sheep (on high-quality pasture), Angora used on high quality
Sheep grazers

Outline the regional growth rates of small ruminants
?
In HRZ and sheep wheat perennial grasses such as ryegrass and phalaris grow compared to predominantly annual in wheat/sheep or pastoral areas
More responsive (perennial grasses) to rainfall as have root reserves to start seed growth faster
Longer growing season in HRZ compared to WSZ compared to pastoral - impacts options for what sorts of small ruminant enterprises

Outline Summer/Autumn pasture quality
?
Pasture dries off it reduces in quality and quantity
Supplementary feed or fodder crops
Lambs want between 4 and 6 kg because too big is bad and too small likely to pass, a moderate condition score is best

Outline the feed budget for small ruminants
?
Intake - Requirement = Surplus or deficit
Intake: pasture or supplements
Demand: Maintenance, milk, growth, pregnancy, work

How much energy does a sheep normally need::8mj per day

Outline the factors that affect energy intake
?
Type of animal and physiological status
Pasture length (feed availability)
Feed quality (ME and protein content)

What is the calculation of ME intake::ME = kg DM/day * MG ME/kg DM

How much do typical small ruminants eat
?
Most small ruminants normally eat 2-3% bw per day
3-4% for lamb calves
5% for lactating and pregnant

Outline nutrition and intake
?
Sick sheep eat and produce less
Well fed sheep have less disease

Outline pasture quality vs quantity
?
Quantity = feed availability
Quality = ME, protein, etc.

Outline grazing systems
?
Set stocking
- In lambing Merino's don't handle lambs well because they will abandon them
- British breeds are better but not ideal
- Food carts can also make this difficult
Rotational grazing
- Not really in the pastoral zone

Outline nutrition of small ruminants through pregnancy
?
Important to maintain conditions to ensure enough energy is available for the dam and progeny
For merino sheep if lack of nutrition reduces the development of secondary fibres and long-term wool
birthweight
Differential feeding

Outline the handling of young lam and how to get mothers to take on new lambs
?
Needs colostrum in first 12 hours (can be stored frozen) can tube lambs with colostrum if not suckling
if lambs/kids disowned by the dam can be fostered if a spare dam is available
Can be reared on lamb milk replacer (happens in the dairy system but can part feed on dam also in some systems)

What is the difference between sheep milk and cow milk::Sheep milk has higher protein and fats

Outline the supplementary feed of sheep
?
very different feed availability year to year in extensive production systems
Where energy needs not met
Supplementary feed-  grains, hay, silage, straw and other
Factors impacting cost
- Cost per MJ
- Feedtest needed, and consider the costs of transport
- Compare to other options - agist, lease, sell
- Monitor using CS and weight change - assess if estimation is correct over time
- Trace elements - blood or tissue test

Outline sheep and goat diaries
?
Many now operating cut and carry feeding, kept in a large shed and fodder brought to them, a mixture of freshly cut grass, silage, grain, straw

Outline goat nutrition
?
Similar figures apply to goats, however the challenge is parasites
If goats graze at sheep height tend to see increased internal parasite challenges given goats are more suited to browse type diet
Goats are often used as weed control (some herds are used to clean up week issues)
Overgrazing if overstocked
One reason why dairy goats are brought into sheds is to manage parasite numbers as this breaks nematode lifecycle
