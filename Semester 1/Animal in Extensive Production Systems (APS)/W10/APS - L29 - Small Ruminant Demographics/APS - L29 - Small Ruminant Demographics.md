# APS - L29 - Small Ruminant Demographics

Outline the changes in the sheep industry in the last 20 years::Increase in lamb production, reduction in mutton production, reduction in sheep numbers, decrease in wool production

Where do small ruminant products go to
?
Very little sheep dairy export
Lamb export: 25% China, 21% US, 7% Qatar, 7% UAE, 5% South Korea
Mutton export: 44% China, 10% US, Malaysia 9%
Live sheep export: 33% Kuwait, 30% Qatar, 15% Jordan, 8% UAE, 1.1 million in 2019
Goat meat: USA, Taiwan, South Korea, Trinidad and Tobago

Outline live sheep export over time
?
Used to be a larger producer but now there is a much fewer sheep export
The reduced time range that sheep can be exported
Increased price of Australian sheep
Sheep primarily exported mainly from Western Australia

Outline red meat exports
?
United States, China, Japan, South Korea
Beef > Lamb + Mutton > Goat

Outline lamb carcass export 
?
North America
MENA
China
South East Asia

Outline Mutton export by country
?
China, MENA, South East Asia, North America

Outline Goat exports by time/country
?
North America, China, South Korea
Using mostly feral goats, to make more sustainable and get money back

Outline the distribution of sheep and wool producers in Australia
?
Concentrated in sheep + wheat zone
Some in high rainfall zone
Stocking in Western Victoria is high-density stocking
Dairy and beef are in the highest zone, and sheep are worth less so  not as good quality
30% in reduction ins heep numbers from 2004 to present
Queensland had wild dog problems and severe drought which lead to their reduction

Outline the distribution of goats in Australia
?
The vast majority of goats in Australia are feral goats
Fibre and meat goats have a similar range to sheep
Dairy goats tend to be concentrated in high rainfall zones although often fed in the dairy to remove parasite burden
Dairy goats are often fed rations
Meat goats found in low rainfall zones

Outline the patterns of sheep movement
?
West to East (seasons)
Pastoral to sheep/wheat and high rain
Local zone/seasonal
- Important for disease
- State-based biosecurity e.g. liver fluke in WA
The stall market is where lambs that aren't quite finished are sold to another property to finish them
Most sheep farms have a self-replacing flock
Veterinary district veterinarians > state vet > national vet
The majority of sheep enterprises run a self-replacing system (there are a number of good reasons for this)
The majority of animals entering are ram replacements
Major movement off property = cull ewes, cull rams and surplus young stock (lambs/hoggets)
Most sheep move within a 200km region of where born, and some sales, e.g. abattoir, may be >200kg. May be longer for stud animals
Drought and floods may make movement further
technology allows for greater movement with increased bidding e.g. Auctionplus interface with live sale

Outline sheep production systems in Australia
?
Self-replacing wool (54%)
Self-replacing meat (25%)
Wether-based (6%)
Crossbred (3%)
Trading and other (12%)
Currently not a low of dairies but the number is increasing
Lamb meat production is mostly in Victoria
Increases in overall lamb production, increase in carcass weight (feeding + carcass weight)
Lamb carcass weights in Australia are significantly higher than New Zealand lamb carcass weights
Overall value of lamb has increased in value in last 10 years

Outline the Easter Market Indicator
?
From 1990 to 2010, prices were low until they started to increase
Due to COVID prices dropped steeply

Major shifts identified by the early 2000s
?
1. Shift to lower micron flocks, particularly in Merino production
2. Shift to overall high bodyweight wees
3. Reduction in overall wether numbers being retained past 2 years of age
4. Increased joining of older and cull (for type) merino ewes to terminal sires such as Dorsets, BLs, WS - may be finished on the farm or sold as store lambs eg moving from sheep/wheat zone to high rainfall zone commonly

Outline the micron differential in sheep
?
Smaller micron means higher premium
Used to be a lot better but now not as significant
Mostly because better availability of very fine wool

How is the clean fleece weight vs greasy fleece weight::80% of greasy fleece weight is about what clean fleece weight is

How did the percentage of merinos change::Decreased, used to be 90%, but now it is 70 with more crossbreeds, a reduced amount of wethers these days

Outline the bodyweight change in Merinos
?
Increased body weight means more meat and wool
Increased bodyweight does usually means more coarse fleece
The trick is more weight with the same coarseness
Increasing the DSE as bodyweight means it is heavier
The difference in wrinkle score
