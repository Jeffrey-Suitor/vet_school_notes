# APS - L30 - Small Ruminant Production Systems

Outline the average small ruminant enterprise in Australia
?
Meat, milk, and fibre look different
Milk production tends to have lower numbers of stock overall, as they are more intensive operations
Milk enterprises tend to be in high-rainfall areas

Outline the average lamb farm
?
17700 Australian farms produced at least 200 lambs for slaughter
A diversified mix of enterprises - wool, lambs, sheep, beef cattle and crops
Produce wool as a co-product
The number of larger grain farms producing lambs for slaughter has increased (grazing stubble, and winter greens)
The number of lambs per farm increased over the past 30 years from 770 to 1100 (some from amalgamation of farms, more lamb marking rates)
Increase in lamb marking rate from 86% in 2000 to 94% in 2019 (Can be 100-140% in first cross ewes, sheep shearing is less preferred on meat breeds as the wool is worse and so farms moving to hair)
More offspring per ewe mated on average by using meat sheep genetics 
Greater reliance on improved pastures and supplementary feeding

T/F you can easily change enterprise types on a sheep farm because it is mixed::True

Outline the typical farm management cycle for sheep wheat zone in Australia
?
A summer joining with a winter lambing
Weaning in spring with the culling of rams, ewes and hoggets
Ram purchases at about the same time as the weaning
Lambs/weaner sales vary with climate and season and are usually in spring or autumn
Most of the largest annual ram sales occur in the spring
Shearing tends to be clustered around autumn and spring but can occur at any time
Little being live exported, mostly South and Western are where this occurs
Wether flock is less work than a self-replacing farm

Outline the typical farm in the high rainfall zone in Australia
?
Some live export
Quite a lot through sale yards
Direct to the abattoir for larger farms
A lot of stock movement
Similar mustering frequency to sheep wheat zone

Composite breeds in higher rainfall zone, decent wool but meat

The tougher country has merinos, and as meat price increases more likely to see hair type breeds

Outline the wool and lamb production in Australia
?
39 000 producing wool
Half have less than 1000 ewes
In Western Victoria more common to see large farms with high stocking rate
Tend to have beef cattle, and will still sell lambs even if not as profitable as meat breeds

Outline the average meat goat farm in Australia
?
Highly variable
Changes from relatively small Boer goat farm with a few hundred animals up to 10 000+ feral goats managed in pastoral country using goat fencing to keep goats in and harvest at regular intervals
The actual size of the feral goat population is not entirely certain - working on aerial survey data
Feral goat to international markets, Boer goat to domestic

Outline the average goat fibre farm
?
The average size of Mohair (Angora) farms is relatively small ie Hundreds of goats, frequently peri-urban, although some larger farms
The size of cashmere is also relatively small for high-quality cashmere goats albeit cashmere also on feral goats so may be opportunistically collected

Outline the average dairy goat farm
?
68 licensed dairy goat farms in Australia in 2018
Average herd size of 96
The median number of goats per farm is 150
Average production per goat 2.5 L/day
60% sold as cheese, 18% as fresh milk and the remaining as powder and other products
Likely a total herd of about 30,000 goats in 2019 but some larger operations commencing with 1000s of goats
These figures are a significant increase on 2009 figures and don't include small goat milking for personal use

Outline sheep dairying
?
Most enterprises milk less than a few hundred ewes and produce speciality cheese and other products
Larger scale enterprises can milk multiple thousands of ewes per day

Outline the needs of a small ruminant self-replacing system
?
Time for lambing and kidding
unless using lights./hormones this is chosen for some breeds as they will only breed to give birth in spring
Generally, choose 3-4 months before pastures senescence (when the grass dries off) for when Merino ewe should have lambed
Similar timing to produce store lambs is first/second cross
if targeting rime lambs then 5 months per pasture senescence

Outline stocking rate of small ruminant farms
?
based on the French equation for southern areas of the country in moderate/higher rainfall
Need to work out DSE based on animal size and what it produces
- Dairy goats/sheep will require higher DSE due to milk production
- Sheep milk significantly higher energy requirement than cow milk (higher energy and protein)

Outline the matching pasture production curve with sheep and goat needs
?
Sheep are grown in a range of climatic zones in Australia (excepting tropical areas of Aust, north/coastal QLD, NT and Northern WA)
The pasture curve varies considerably
The gestation period for sheep/goats is about 150 days
Aim for animals to give birth for lactation to match peak pasture supply
October or November lambing is typical, can lamb later

Outline optimal stocking rate
?
Previous graphs suggest on optimal time to maximise stocking rate and output
Range of reasons why producers may change from this
Differential pricing, lower quality grass, risk of early finish to season, workload, integration of about with other events, impact on timing for other events such as shearing and interaction with cropping in sheep/wheat zone
Similar picture for goats in these sorts of environments noting for some breeds such as Angora will only cycle for a spring kidding anyway

Outline how to apply these small ruminant systems can be applied internationally
?
Similar concept for wherever small ruminants may be farmed around the world
Ideally produce progeny at maximal pasture availability to maintain CS
Good growth of progeny and milk production
Small ruminants vital to SDG, in many countries, particularly fro small holders
Ruminants can graze low quality pasture better than pigs or chickens
