# APS - L28 - Small Ruminant Breeds

## Merino Sheep

What is the general rule of thumb for goat vs sheep::goat = tail up, tail down = sheep

How do we recognize meat versus wool versus milk type breed?
?
Meat breed will appear more muscular from a side view
Milk breeds of goat or sheep are lactating often so the size of the udder can giveaway although some milk and fibre-producing breeds also have large udders
Some small ruminants are haired, rather than have useful fibre, which helps to indicate their usage
Thick vs finer coat differences

Outline the Merino sheep
?
Significant genetic diversity within the Merino breeds, multiple strains/types within the one breed of sheep due to the range of historical breeding
Suit different environments/management systems
Merino is a multipurpose animal, whose its primary use has been wool production they can also be selected to be more dual-purpose animals with breeds derived from Merino aiming for that market
Merino breed is not static and has evolved with time

Outline ultrafine merino (16,1-17.5 microns)
Extra-ultrafine is 16.0 microns or less
Relatively uncommon sheep - finest fibre in the world (competition each year for finest fleece)
Small framed Merino's value of fleece means sometimes coated to reduce dust
Sometimes shedded also to control fleece growth although less common time
Some bales averaging under 13.5 microns - product blended with silk/cashmere for high-end garments

Outline superfine merino sheep
?
17.6 - 18.5 microns
Higher rainfall zone

Outline fine wool merino
?
18.6-19.5 microns
Generally located in higher rainfall areas similar to superfine
Fleeces up to 5k or more
Also called Saxon type

Outline fine-medium wool merinos
?
19.6-20.5 microns
A large section of Merino production in this area now, as the national flock has become finer (through genetic selection)
The challenge is to find the fleece diameter while maintaining or increasing the fleece weight
Industry production varies but 5-8 kg (greasy) and staple length 85-110mm

Outline medium merinos
?
20.6 - 22.5 micron
large numbers of these sheep, particularly in sheep/wheat zone (see map) and in pastoral areas
Large frame and relatively plain body (less wrinkled, particularly over last 20 years)
Production suitable for knitwear
Staple length 90-115mm
Also called peppin type

Outline strong wool Merinos
?
22.6 microns or greater
Located in more pastoral areas - hot, dry, semi-arid areas
Relatively hard Merinos
Staple length 100mm
Wool is used in blends for lower-priced garments or more hard-wearing applications (seats in cars, etc.)

What would be the consequence of a strong merino in a high rainfall zone::Fleece rot

Outline the poll, Merino
?
Selection for poll across a range of microns
Recessive gene in Merino
Started at Boonoke Stud (Riverina)
Overall becoming more popular due to EHS and animal welfare

How do we measure microns of sheep
?
60-80% of values buyers place
Micron measuring tool
Older sheep can have bigger microns

Outline the Australian sheep flock
?
41.2 million breed ewes
- 31.5 million Merino ewes (77%)
- 9.7 million non-Merino breeding (23%)
Most sheep producers in 2020 were looking at maintaining or expanding their sheep flock

## Non-Merino Sheep

Outline dual-purpose sheep
?
Dohne
- From peppin type Merino and German Mutton breed
- Polled and plain bodied
- Good fertility, rapid growth and fine wool (18-22 microns)
South African Meat Merino (SAMM)
- Produces heavy-weight prime lamb at an early age
- Dense wool, good lambing percentage
- Polled, large frame, fleece 23 micron
Corriedale
- Produced form crosses between Merino and Lincoln (long wool British breed)
- Began the late 1800s in both NZ and Australia
- Self-replacing
- Large framed, plain body, polled
- Capable of producing heavy-weight prime lamb
- FD 25-30 micron
Polwarth
- Similar to Corriedale but 3/4 Merino and 1/4 Lincoln
- Suited to wetter, colder areas
- FD 23-25 microns
Coopworth
- Combination of border Leicester and Romney Marsh genetics
- Developed in NZ
- Polled, good mother and milking and twinning rates
- Wool 30-35 microns

Outline British Longwools
?
Generally used ina. range of crosses with Merino to produce F1 or other stabilised breeds
Include English Leicester, border Leicester, Lincoln and Cheviot
Relatively few of these sheep are in Australia, and a larger range of UK long wools are in the UK
In general broad micron wool (>27 microns and mostly >30 microns)
May need twice yearly shearing (Lincoln grows up to 30cm of fleece annually) - hand spinners/knitters often use it
Border Leicester is most commonly used in Australia as a sire of first cross ewes

Outline terminal sires in the Australian lamb industry
?
Common in the Australian lamb industry to use a ram to produce lambs for sale where both castrated male (wether) and female (ewe) are sold, hence the rams are called terminal sires
Breeds use predominantly Poll Dorset and White Suffolk but also include Texel, Charolais, Southown and others
Characteristics 25-35 microns, relatively short and "springy"
Rapid growth, significant muscling

Why would Merino producers not want black wooled sheep on the farm::If that black fibre enters the main white Merino fibers it will ruin the batch

What are some new recent breeders in the Australian sheep industry?
?
Dorper and White Dorper: "low maintenance meat sheep, adapted to a vast range of conditions across the country"
Damara: "Damara sheep tolerate heat well and are able to walk long distances, making use of feed away from watering points. They have been performing successfully in Wheatbelt regions and pastoral country of Australia"

Outline the sheep-milking breeds
?
East Friesian
Awassi
These are the two main imported sheep milking breeds with some local breeds and crosses being used
long lactation
High volume
Higher protein and butter fat than goat and cattle dairy

Outline the range of newly developing breeds in the Australian sheep industry
?
Constant evolution in breeds as industry requirements change
Shedding breeds becoming more common, particularly in the pastoral zone (if the cost of shearing is more than fleece value it makes sense to have to shed, albeit means can't suddenly start producing wool)
Difficult to import any new breeds and very expensive due to biosecurity requirements (depending on country of origin) (25-10 years)

Outline the worldwide variation in sheep breeds
?
Massive variation around the world in sheep breeds
The ones listed here are the most common in Australia but there are huge numbers elsewhere so you know breeds that occur in the local area if you end up working elsewhere
Jacob sheep there who can have multiple pairs of horns

## Goat Breeds

T/F Haired goats are unlikely to produce any useful fibre::True

T/F goat that is lactating with a relatively small udder is unlikely to be primarily a milk animal::True

What are the two main types of fibre goats
?
Goats are used to produce types of fibre
- Mohair (from Angora)
- Cashmere (from a range of breeds with much from wild-type goats in Australia)
These fibres are quite different and the goats that produce them are very different in appearance

Outline Angora goats
?
Angora fibre comes from rabbit, goat produces mohair
Imports from Texas and South Africa to increase fibre production and growth rates
200 000 in Australia
Many small flocks of periurban
Shear twice per year
Fleece weight 1-2.5 kg
Wean rates up to 160%
Fibre diameter - commences at 23 microns
Increases with age

Outline cashmere goats
?
Not a breed of goat
A range of goats can produce cashmere
Australian cashmere originated from feral goats and selecting those that produce a high amount of the soft cashmere fibre
Cashmere fibre under 19 microns (usually 14-18 microns)
Produce 100-500g per animal
Range of potential colours - white = ideal
Usually shorn in June/July in Australia
Combed in other countries (potential pain associated)

Outline meat breed goats
?
There is a large range of goats bred for meat and the world and in all systems (milk/fibre) goats will generally contribute to the meat sector at some point (when culled)
Pure meat breed goats tend to be hair, rather than useful fibre like cashmere or mohair (albeit Australian range goats are regularly used for meat and also may have limited cashmere in wild type animals)

What are the Boer goats?
?
The most common meat breed goat in Australia (from South Africa)
Arrived in 1980s-1990s
Good browser rather than a grazer (like sheep)
Hardy, good fertility, high growth and muscle, good dressing percentage
Can produce 3 kids' crops in 2 years

Outline the Kalahari Red
?
Red, medium to large framed lob-eared meat goat
Horned
Mature female weight 75 kg

Outline feral goats in Australia
?
generally considered an invasive pest, but recently transformed into a significant source of income and managing sustainability better
Range in colour and type
generally free ranging
Rounded up for sale
Pastoral country

Outline the dairy breed goats
?
it is not uncommon in periurban areas to find small properties with a milking doe to provide milk for a household as production matches the needs
A range of health issues can occur so not uncommon for these to be presented to "city" or city fringing veterinary clinics
Huge range of species of dairy goats around the world so focusing on common species in Australia
Essentially all dairy goats are selected on similar needs of good milk production for a long period while there may be some degree of co-selection on body type for meat as well
Along with milk production looking at udder/test conformation, behavioural traits
The dairy goat breeds society of Australia recognises 10 breeds of dairy goat in Australia including **Saanen, Toggenburn, British Alpine, Anglo Nubian**, Australian Mellan, Australian Brown, Nigerian Dwarf, **Lamancha**, Alpine and Sable

Outline the Saanen
?
White or cream colour with tan skin
Original stock from France, Switzerland and England
Generally polled but occasionally with horns (can be some issues with infertility associated with polled ness in goats)
Females about 65 kg
Big range in milk production but up to 1000 litres or more

Outline the Anglo-Nubian dairy goat 
?
Originated in UK from breeding stock from Middle Eat/India hence the name of the breed
Anglo Nubian in UK prior to the arrival of Saanen
Generally higher meat qualities than other dairy breeds
Suited to slightly warmer climates due to background genetics
Can be any colour, recognisable by long pendulous ears
Generally polled but some kids horned

Outline the Toggenburg goats
?
Arrived in the 1940s (one of a number of goat breeds at state research farms)
Not well suited to tropical climates, better cool climate goat
Slightly smaller than other dairy breeds (55kg)
Colour varies from deep brown to pale fawn with white markings
Some polled and some horned

Outline the british alpine
?
Originally developed from swiss breeds important into Britain and crossed with local goats
Temperate goat
Primarily black with white markings
Some polled, some horned
Erect ears

Outline the La mancha
?
Easiest way to check breed is very short or non-existent ears (this is a natural feature of the breed, not an injury)
American breed
Polled or horned
Can be any colour
