# APS - L7 - Management Procedures

## Before Birth and Weaning

What is weaning::process of removing the young animal from its dam (mother), it can also mean removal of the young from a source of milk

T/F weaning often entails significant handling during manage procedures

What is dystocia (difficult birth)
?
Goal is to avoid dystocia
Will always be some dams who have dystocia, experience farmers may deal with or a veterinarian may be called
generally done on property, some small ruminants may get transported to clinic
Range of equipment to assist with dystocia (ropes, chains, hooks, etc.)
Some sort of traction - ropes, pulley, jack, etc (but not excessive force)
not every young will be able to be born successfully naturally, some will require a caesarean to be born alive
Once born, young may need further assistance
Leave mother and young to bond post birth presuming young is accepted

Provide a general overview of vaccination in extensive production systems
?
Commonly used in extensive production systems
Range of diseases are vaccinated against, varies between farm
Mostly given by subcutaneous injection high on neck
Needle size ranges from 16G to 20G using 1/2 inch needle 
Generally used autodosing vaccine administrator from "pillow pack"
Most vaccines require cold chain and have expiry date
Generally given without cleaning but avoid post rainfall or wet stock

What is an eartag
?
NLIS - must have PIC some electronic eID before you graduate likely all Australian NLIS = eID
Tags must be fitted prior to stock movement from a farm (both sheep and cattle in Victoria MUST have eID)
Tag shape/type/brand varies - can be two part (male and female) or single tag
Purchase from DPI in Victoria
Tag has NLIS ID and also physical ID (receive an e-file that links these)
Can read tags using an electronic read (handheld or panel)
Can read rapidly, improve precision management e.g. weighing

What are the plastic visual ear tags
?
Huge range of sizes, shapes, colour and components
Range of reasons for choosing between these
Colour = year or property of origin
Large or Maxi tags allow easier readability from distance in paddock but increased risk of being torn out
Generally loss rate of a few per year
Often stud animals will have multiple ear tags (and/or other method of ID, usually at least one permanent)
Different applicators for different type of tags

What are metal ear tags
?
Can be used in extensive livestock
Most commonly used in small ruminants or in stud cattle
Lower risk of loss
Different applicator
May catch a shearing handpiece and damage a comb or cutter

What is an ear mark
?
Varying shapes, individual property registered marks
Still required in WA, not other states
Permanent property level form of ID

What is an ear tattoo
?
Also permanent form of identification (ID)
More difficult to read, often need to clean the ear
Same technique as human tattoo, break skin and apply tattoo
Tattoo applicator (plier) and letters/number/shape with other side of applicator a solid black
Cuts skin and ink applied

What is wing castration
?
Range of tools to achieve outcome
Most commonly small elastic ring (lamb device)
Placed over testicles and restricts blood flow so testicle tissue sloughs off over a few weeks
Important to remove both testicles
Need to use on animals with relatively small testicles so able to stop blood flow
Pain relief products - NSAID, local anaesthetic and device to apply
Older calves - Callicrate or California bander or just larger sized ring
General recommendation = younger is better
Technique is bloodless but not pain free

What is knife castration
?
Using a sharp knife to cut skin and remove both testicles
Ma also include an emasculator to cut and crush blood vessels
Need to leave adequate drainage hole in skin to ensure doesn't close too quickly
Variations in skin cut

What is Burdizzo castration
?
Bloodless castration
Clamp and crush blood vessels through skin (double clamp technique)
Least commonly used method
Needs significant expertise
Also range of research chemical methods for castration but not registered for use

Tail docking
?
Routine procedure but not other systems
Optimal length for sheep 3-4 coccygeal joints remaining
- Reduces breech soiling
- Reduces prolapse
- Reduces joint ill
- Reduces fly strike
Generally one at marking (castration, eat tag, dock, vaccinate)
Usually 2-7 weeks of age may vary with mustering
three main methods: ring (1st most common), gas knife (2nd), and knife
Pain relief: local anaesthetic/NSAID

What is dehorning and disbudding
?
Only need if animal is not pulled
Difference between dehorning and disbudding is the age it is done
Early in life = disbudding (before horn connected to skull)
Polled gene = dominant (generally)
Simplest method of dehorning = use polled sire (genomics make this simpler)
Disbudding in first month of life using either sharp knife or heat (gas/electric)
Dehorning range of cutting devices
All causes pain - local anaesthetic/NSAID/anaesthetic
Deer are a particular case that will be covered in more detail given annual nature

## Management Procedures During Weaning

When would you condition score the Ewus::use body condition and fat score to assess relative amounts of muscle and fat. Fat score is commonly used on labs to assess readiness or sale while condition score is used to follow weight loss / gain on older livestock

How does fat score work in beef::In beef cattle the P8 site and 12th rib are used as landmarks to assess fat score that ranges from 1-6, 1-5 in Australia

Provide an overview of condition scoring
?
Cheap and quick to perform on each animal
Requires animals in race to be able to feel
Actual condition score range varies from species to species (1-5 or 1-8)
Low number = skinnier animal, high number = fatter
ideally animals should be in middle range to be healthy (or higher end of middle)
Use both eyes and hands to assess

What is drenching
?
Applying a product for parasite controls
Drenching historically refers to administration of oral compounds including (anthelmintics) can now also refer to using anthelmintics via subcutaneous or transdermal routes
Frequently done at time of weaning, allowing weaned stock to go onto clean paddock (low parasite contamination) - ideally part of IPM

What are the primary types of parasites we manage via drenching
?
Endoparasites (internal), mostly
Main cases are: flies, lice, and ticks
Flies can be problem for all species - particular producing fibre = fly-strike, but can be annoying and spread disease in all
Tick and tick borne diseases historically mostly Northern Australia but also higher rainfall coastal area
Treatment should incorporate understanding of lifecycle of parasite
Treatment includes dipping, pour-on, injection
Mites less common, generally controller through endectocide use

What is branding, when does it occur, and what types of branding
?
Range of methods to temporarily or permanently brand a hide/skin
Freezebranding: Freezes skin and leaves no pigment for a white brand (or longer to lose all hair), liquid nitrogen or dry ice
Firebranding: Burns skin and leaves lifelong brand, more common where difficult to do free branding
Paint branding: common short term identification such as at sale yards, oil based brand used for sheep (not actually paint)
Dry raddle: For identifying sheep in mob short term. Similar raddle used for rams when mating sometimes

How do we age stock
?
Checking stock to see if will be retained - chevk ear tag colour but also teeth
8 teeth = full mouth, table shows adult incisor
Deer not routinely aged by teeth
Alpaca have 3 sets of incisors, first erupt at 2 years, 3 years, and 3-6 years

What is a male reproductive examination
?
Generally performed a few months prior to when due to be mated
Also frequently done on young males at weaning in stud enterprises to see if capable of being used for breeding
At minimum usually examines testicles, penis, prepuce, feet/legs (ability to walk), condition score, teeth, eyes
Role of male in extensive livestock is to be capable of successfully inseminating a certain number of females - needs all these areas to achieve this

Describe the post weaning process
?
Young animals often educated to novel feed at weaning time (ideally already trained pre weaning)
Managing in yards enhancing any future intensive feed as already used to it
Trans to dogs/noises etc and novel feedstuff they may experience
Feedlots prefer animals that have already experienced this environment

How do we manage feet on enterprises
?
Range of soil type and climate impacts feet growth and wear
May require intervention to manage feet (although better if can be managed by genetics/environment)
Disease often requires increased foot management e.g. footrot
Range of devices to trim feet, also options for foot bathing

How do we manage fibre on enterprises

Maintenance of wool/fibre on small ruminants will be coverd in week 9 -12 however is important on 6-12 month basis (varies according to demand for certain fibre length and growth rate on different breeds)
Main wool removal = shearing
Shearing around breech area removed during crutching (commonly a few months prior to shearing) - reduces fly risk
Shearing sheds in Australia for this but in other countries may be done outside
Powered handpiece used for shearing (historically blade shearing)

What are the regularly yearly livestock activities
?
Vaccination: 2 initial doses and then yearly
Drenching: 2 drenches per day 
Feeding stock, comes back to weighing stock and condition score and pasture assessment/management
Joining (mating)
Removing males
