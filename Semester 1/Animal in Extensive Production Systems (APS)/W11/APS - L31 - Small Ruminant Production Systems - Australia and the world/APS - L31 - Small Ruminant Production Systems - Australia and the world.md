# APS - L31 - Small Ruminant Production Systems - Australia and the world

## Worldwide and Australian Sheep Farm Characteristics
Has Australian sheep meat production increased::Increased

T/F Australian enterprises are very profitable::They are kind of profitable, depending on enterprise performance

T/F EU enterprises are largely supported by government payments::True

What is a sucker::A lamb sold directly from its lamb to a sale yard or abattoir

Outline the size of Australian sheep enterprises compared to other countries
?
Larger overall with far more sheep
May not be as profitable per sheep as in some other countries but due to scale the overall return is more

Outline the size of lambs sold in Australia
?
In Western Australia, they tend to be lighter weight because they are sold on the domestic market
NSW they tend to be heavier as they are being sold on the export market

How does grazing impact feed cost::Grazing make it far cheaper because of the lower cost of production

Outline weaning rates in Australia compared to other systems
?
Large range up to 140%
Merinos lower and will go as low as 70-80%

How many ewes per hectare is normal for a grazing system::Less than 10, but feedlots will be higher because they are fed concentrates

Outline the growth rates of sheep
?
Australians usually 300g/day
Germany like 500g
Brazil like 50g

Outline the lamb sale weights per ewe
?
Merino will be a lower sale weight per ewe
First cross ewe will be much heavier weight

## Yearly Management Cycle

What is the first decision to make in a self-replacing enterprise?
?
When to lamb or kid
If Rams/bucks are left in all year round
Following the natural breeding season, matching feed availability

Outline a Merino timeline for a Merino enterprise
?
Joining -> Mid-March
lambing pen -> Mid august (usually a 5-week window, 2 weeks on mother)
October
- Marking (2 weeks post lambing)
- Castration (males)
- Eartag
- Vaccination
- Tail (Straight knife but often tail wing or tail gun)
- Mulesing
- Count
- Weaning start
Mid-November -> 2nd vaccination, Drench, weaning finished
Dec - Jan: Stock sales (prime lambs, cull ewes), add summer crops

Outline the selection of lambing and kidding
?
The biggest driver of the stocking rate
Other management procedures flow from the date of parturition
Merino's 3-4 months before pasutre dry off (senescence)
Store lambs: 4 months before pasture senescence
Finished lambs: 5 months before pasture senescence
Balancing act - lamb/kid as late as possible to maximise stocking rate but the issue with finishing lambs or managing lambs over early summer
Ideally, expect 70-75% ewes pregnancy per cycle so get >90% in two
Tight joining (5 weeks) makes management easier
Some enterprises (prime lamb particularly) may join longer since it's the main profit driver

Outline timing lambing and feeding
?
Higher rainfall zone go later to better match
The sheep wheat zone goes earlier because the season is shorter
Best to match up to reduce costs

Outline marking of sheep
?
2 weeks after lambing finishes (reduce mismothering)
First vaccination
Castration
Tail docking (3rd joint at the tip of vulva, ring or kife/heat)
Count - marking % (lams present/ewes)
Marking % can vary - 70-150%, breed, time of year, nutrition, CS
Mulesing?

Outline sheep vaccinations
?
Almost all killed vaccines need two doses (4-6 weeks apart) and then yearly
Exception = JD vaccine (Gudair)
5 in 1
6 in 1 (5 in 1, + cheesy disease)
Erysipelas
Scabigard (single shot)
Gudair (single shot)
Campyvax (campylobacter)
Barbervac (H. contortus)

Outline weaning in sheep
?
12-16 weeks post lambing start (5 week lambing)
At 12 weeks Merino ewe lactation decreased - may leave other breeds longer as lactation longer
Get lambs away from parasites and onto high-quality grass/feed
Youngest lambs > 6 weeks for functional rumen
2nd vaccination
Drench (almost always have parasites)
May snatch rear goat kids for disease control - wean once eating enough solid feed

Outline prime lamb sales
?
Start from about 16 weeks of age
Lamsb sold straight from dams are called "suckers"
other lambs weaned, sell all before first adult teeth in wear
Might sell as "store" lambs, not finished
Store lambs may go onto grain, grass, stubbles
Higher rainfall favours finishing systems hence stock may move from pastoral to wheat/sheep or wheat/sheep to high rainfall for finishing

Outline how to retain weaners
?
How to feed over the summer
Need to make sure that they grow well and continue to grow
Important to feed extra to ensure they have enough nutrients
Containment/feedlot, high energy and protein
Check random samples every 4-6 weeks for growth

Outline the strategic treatments that sheep and goats will use
?
Designed to control pathogens at critical life cycle stages
Lots of off-label use for goats
Summer drenching
- Winter worms come from late spring/summer pasture contamination, so give 2 summer drenches in Dec/Feb, make sure to test before to reduce the amount of drench used
- Apply fly chemical to sheep in early spring to reduce following fly generations - covert strikes reduced
- Monitor over the strike period
- Lice - often treated off shears in case lice present (can be hard to detect), because you get a good kill rate, and it's expensive to treat rather than prevent

Outline the culling of sheep
?
Age 
Teeth 
Wool
Other (type)
Often done in early summer - stock in maximum condition and won't require supplementary feed. Generally shorn prior to sale. Optimal age of ewes is generally 6 years (varies from region to region)

Outline the structure of flock for small ruminants
?
Prime lamb focussed flock has lots of ewes lambs and weaners but no mature wethers (all eat)
Wethers are
- More worm resistant
- Able to be grazed harder
- produce more wool
- Less labour intensive
- More wether = more wool income
- More ewes = more meat income
- Flock structures vary with markets
- Micron blows out as sheep age

Outline condition scoring of sheep
?
Ewes need to be CS 3 at mating (not fat but good fertility)
Monitor CS per-joining
Manage nutrition as necessary (care with $, budget)
Breeding soundness exam for Rams
3-3.5 at lambing for singles and twins
Maybe a drench before lambing

Outline managing fly risk in sheep
?
Blowfly activity increases in spring (warmth, moisture)
Chemical prophylaxis
Crutching
Shearing

Outline shearing of sheep
?
Generally done once annually, some properties may reduce to every eight months - need to get adequate length of wool
Often summer or early autumn
If lice are present, apply eradication insecticide "off shears"
Apply long wool preparation to limit damage wf necessary (depends on $ as to best option)
