# APS - L33 - Breeding and Genetics

Outline the normal breeding cycle of sheep
?
Estrous cycle = length of time between when a ewe comes onto heat (is interested in the ram)
On average 17-day cycle varies from 14 to 19 days for most sheep
Length of time on heat varies but mostly 18-36 hours (younger ewes often have shorter periods). Some ewes have even shorter heat or longer
Age at puberty - variable but generally 6-9 months
Weight at first mating about 75% of adult weight
Seasonal breeders, although some breeds of sheep will breed out of season (Merino, Poll Dorset and others), more tropical sheep breeds tend to be less influenced by season
During breeding season if not pregnant will come on heat every 17 days
Ewes seek out the rams so an individual ram may be surrounded by several ewes on heat
Some breeds are highly seasonal such as the Leicester and Texel, however their cross with Merino e.g. First Corss have increased breeding season
Over a few cycles >90% of ewes should get in lamb
can use a mating harness to watch the progress of joining (harness goes on ram)

Outline the normal goat breeding cycle
?
21-day cycle
Time on heat is 24 hours
Puberty at 5-9 months (40% adult weight)
75% of adult weight at first mating
Seasonal breeders, although some meat breeds will breed out of season
Stress in goats particularly in early pregnancy can abort the pregnancy, and minimise handling through a pregnancy where possible

Outline the changing of the breeding cycle
?
Use of teasers (surgical/physical/chemical)
- Vasectomised
- Cover the abdomen to stop actual mating occurring
- Testosterone treated whether (can't go into the food chain)
- Ram/buck effect
Hormones
Lights (if stock is in a shed - most commonly used in dairy goat/sheep industries as frequently kept in sheds)

Outline pregnancy in goat and sheep
?
145-150 for goats and sheep
Actual length can vary within and between breeds
The easiest way to check is from the date of ramming or the date of the AI to the actual date of lambing
Multiple pregnancies in a single year
3 pregnancies every two years but requires very good nutrition 
Challenging to get goats or ewes pregnant during early lactation

Outline the male-to-female ratio
?
Prime lamb - use 1.5-2% Rams
Merino 1 per 100 plus 1
Dairy sheep - varies with how much AI is done, need enough ram power to mate ewes on heat
Meat goats - a similar percentage to prime lamb, increased if a pastoral country (feral goats)
Angora goats - varies but often 2.5%
Diary goats - as per sheep, depend on AI rate and synchronisation

## Genetics in Small Ruminants

What are the genetic tools in the Australian small ruminant industry?
?
Lambplan
Kidplan
Merinoselect
No commercially available data on dairy goats, dairy sheep or goat fibre

How do we analyse genetics
?
Performance = genetics x environment
Start to identify just the genetics, not the environment

What is needed on the farm
?
Collect physical data e.g. body weight, fleece weight, rearing type
Collect pedigree data - dam/sire, GD/GS, GGD, GGS
Keep stock in management groupings to allow fair comparison
Submit data to SGA
SGA review and analyse data and publish EBVs
Continually updated as more data on siblings, progeny, ancestors
FBV in flock
Across the flock is AEBV or ASBVs

What are indexes in small ruminants
?
Terminal progeny index
Eating quality index
The index is a good general but needs to look at figures underlying that

Outline kidplan
?
EBVs available to the ASBVs for meat sheep
Used for meat breed goats Boer
If rangeland goat harvesters want to increase meat genetics in herds can import Boer bucks and release
Index example
Look at expected change and monitor

## Genomics

Outline genomics in small ruminants
?
Genotyping uses the process of finding differences in the genetic makeup of individuals
Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) show differences between stock across the genome
The physical process for getting genomics performed involves collecting a spot of blood and sending this to a laboratory
This data from an SNP chip then go to SGA to be added to the genetics analysis
This is possible due to a large amount of research done on a population of several thousand sheep that had genomics data collected and compared to phenotypic information
Can be used for determining parents

What are some conditions that can be found by genomics
?
Yellow fat
Hairy lamb
Myostatin
Spider lamb
Scrapie

Outline the benefits of genomics
?
Range of benefits, particularly in aiding identify high quality (and low quality) animals early
Improve accuracy of hard to measure traits
Relies on industry flocks to ensure that quality f genomics information is relevant
