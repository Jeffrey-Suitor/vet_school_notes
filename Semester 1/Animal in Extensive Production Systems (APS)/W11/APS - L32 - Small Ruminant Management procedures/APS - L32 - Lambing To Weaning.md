# 11.5 From lambing to weaning

When we discuss extensive livestock production the primary definition is that for the majority of the year the animals are grazing paddocks for their own feed and managers are not bringing the feed to them.  Some key elements determine how much pasture will grow in a given time period and how quickly it can grow.  These elements determine where different classes of stock may be managed and how many of them can be grazed in an area – the stocking density.

## 11.5.1  Lambing/Kidding

In Australia lambing is almost always happening outdoors, although some studs will lamb ewes near sheds and shed them for the first few days post lambing to ensure the lambs have the best chance of survival.  On commercial properties it is up to the dams to look after their lamb/s in the paddock or the same for does and their kids.  On sheep or goat dairies some herds/flocks are maintained in large sheds so the kidding and lambing process is more monitored.  

In the following example you can see lambing time in the UK where lambing happens in sheds far more commonly and there is more veterinary involvement in dystocia. Note that some things in the video would not be considered normal practice for Australia such as providing antibiotics to each lamb born for joint ill (infection in a joint).  

Lambing time in the UK

 In a similar way to cattle some lambs may need some assistance being born.  This can particularly be the case where multiple lambs are being born and can get stuck when two or more are being presented at the same time.

Equipment for lambing/kidding is similar to calving but smaller size.  Often ropes are used to apply traction to the legs and a snare may be used to help assist the head.  Caesareans can be performed on a ewe but are relatively uncommon in Australia.

## 11.5.2 Lamb to ewe matching

On stud enterprises it is common for lambs to be tagged or spray marked close to birth to identify them to their dams.  The stud will already know who the dam was mated to so if they know the dam and progeny then they have the full parentage of the progeny.  It is now possible to achieve this by blood test as well if the dam and sires in the flock or herd have already been tested.  This is particularly useful given it is not uncommon when multiple lambs or kids are born near to each other at similar times for some swapping of progeny between dams.  This can be very important when studs are selling high value animals so they may test more valuable individuals even if they believe they already have the right data.  Ewes may be sidebranded with large numbers to avoid having to catch the ewe and just allow the lamb to be caught and tagged and reading the ewes number from a distance to reduce stress. 

## 11.5.3 Marking

Marking includes a range of separate procedures all carried out at the same time to reduce the stress of bringing stock into the yards multiple times.  The following video shows the procedure on a few Poll Dorset lambs at Wyambi, one of the 4Dvirtualfarms you can visit. In this instance the procedure was undertaken in the cattle yards as they were drier and had less stock through them hence were a lower infection risk for young lambs having a range of procedures done.

 

### 11.5.3.1 Counting

At marking lambs are generally counted to calculate a marking percentage (number of lambs marked to ewes at lambing).  If ewes have been pregnancy tested into singles and multiples then this gives a reasonable calculation of the loss rate of lambs from pregnancy testing to marking which is either due to abortion or loss of lambs from birth to weaning.

### 11.5.3.2 Eartag

A range of different types of eartags of different sizes and constructions are available for sheep. In Victoria it is a requirement that sheep are identified with an electronic NLIS tag prior to leaving a property.  In other states a tag must be applied with the relevant PIC number of the property of origin.  Examples of the sorts of visual and electronic tags can be found at [https://www.allflex.global/au/product_cat/visual-identification/Links to an external site.](https://www.allflex.global/au/product_cat/visual-identification/)  [https://www.shearwell.com.au/sheep-tagsLinks to an external site.](https://www.shearwell.com.au/sheep-tags)   [https://www.leaderproducts.com/en_AU/products/visual-identification/Links to an external site.](https://www.leaderproducts.com/en_AU/products/visual-identification/) and other tag manufacturers.

### 11.5.3.3 Tail docking (often just called docking)

Removal of the tail of many breeds of sheep is required to avoid the sheep becoming struck by flies (where a fly lays eggs in the tail/breech region leading to maggots then causing damage in the area).  The optimal length of the tail from a number of research projects suggests the tip of the vulva is the appropriate length in a ewe and a similar length in a ram.

From [http://www.animalwelfarestandards.net.au/files/2011/05/Sheep-Tail-docking-discussion-paper-5.3.13.pdfLinks to an external site.](http://www.animalwelfarestandards.net.au/files/2011/05/Sheep-Tail-docking-discussion-paper-5.3.13.pdf)

The advent of new pain relief products such as Num nuts and both oral or injectable antiinflammatories registered for use in sheep now gives sheep producers options around pain relief both for tail docking and castration.  These products are relatively new so many producers are still experimenting with how they may work in their system.

Tail docking may be peformed using a rubber ring as shown in the video, using a hot blade (mostly gas fired) or using  a sharp knife.  The most preferable of these two are the first two.  Depending if mulesing is performed then the same shears used for mulesing may be used for the tail docking.

### 11.5.3.4 Castration

Castration is performed in rams.  Similar to other extensively raised species this reduces aggression and avoids unwanted pregnancies occurring as well as reducing ram taint that can occur in meat as a ram ages. The majority of sheep enterprises use rubber rings as shown in the video to castrate lambs although it is also possible to use a knife or at a later age a burdizzo or knife/emasculator combination.  As shown in the video local anaesthetic can now be used for the procedures along with antiinflammatory drugs that are now registered for use in sheep.

### 11.5.3.5 Mulesing

Mulesing is not shows in the video above as Poll Dorsets dont have skin wrinkles.  Merino sheep are far more subject to fly strike - either breech strike or body strike (the term used depends on where the flies eggs are laid hence where the eggs hatch). 

![Mulesing.JPG](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/173552/files/13844801/preview)

Mulesing may also be done later than marking time, depending on a whole range of factors.  Some Merino enterprises no longer mules their sheep as they have moved to less wrinkled genetics over time along with extra use of chemicals to protect against flies during fly waves (when large numbers of flies are present).  The mulesing operation itself removes much of the skin folds in the breech area and as it heals it tightens up remaining folds to reduce wrinkle in the area.  It was introduced prior to when fly chemicals were available and Merino sheep were more wrinkly than they are now (this will be covered more under welfare next week)

### 11.5.3.6 Vaccination

Lambs are usually vaccinated for the first time at marking.  Most sheep receive a clostridial vaccination - usually a 5 in 1 or 6 in 1 but it may have less antigens in it depending on the main risks to the flock.  5 in 1 contains only clostridial antigens while 6 in 1 also protects against cheesy gland.  Similarly some flocks will also vaccinate for Johnes disease at this stage while the lambs are small.  Sheep only need a single vaccination with Gudair (the Johnes disease vaccine) without a booster.  Other sheep vaccines in Australia need two vaccinations 4-6 weeks apart with 6-12 monthly boosters - noting it is always important to read the instructions to apply the vaccine at correct dose, frequency and application method.  Generally an 18G needle 1/4 inch will be used for small ruminant vaccinations as their skin is much thinner than cattle skin.  The second vaccination is usually given at weaning time.

There are a range of other vaccines available for sheep and goats that tend to be used less commonly but can be very important parts of management systems.

### 11.5.3.7 Weighing

While it is possible to weight lambs at marking time it is relatively unusual to do so.  This is mostly left until weaning time unless there is a particular reason to be concerned about lamb growth rates or health at marking time.  It is important to get ewes and lambs in and out of yards as soon as feasible at marking to avoid stress to either ewes or lambs.

### 11.5.3.8 Disbudding

Some dairy goat kids have horns and some do not. Increasing use of polled genetics is occurring in other breeds such as the Merino but it is rare for small ruminants apart from dairy small ruminants to be dehorned or disbudded although if horns are getting close to the animals eyes or causing problems they may be tipped to remove the dangerous part of the horn as sheep horns can spiral into the eye in some breeds.

If dairy kids have horns then ideally they should be removed relatively young. Dr Sandra Baxendell demonstrates one way of disbudding young kids in the following video

 

## 11.5.4 Weaning

Weaning time is a big change for the lamb and dam.  In many cases the dam is starting to produce far less milk at this stage and the lamb can be damaging the ewes udder when it sucks by being overly forceful to try and get more milk.  At the time of weaning ewes udder will often swell up considerably if they are still lactating very much.  In some cases this can then progress to mastitis but will mostly regress over a few days as milk production reduces.  The key processes at weaning are drenching, vaccination and weighing.

### 11.5.4.1 Weighing

There are significant potential benefits to weighing small ruminants at weaning to produce data on how well individual animals have performed as well as how an overall mob in a paddock have performed eg. comparing single versus multiple litters to investigate growth rate and decide feeding programs post weaning.  It can also be a good opportunity to draft lambs/kids based on weight to allocate best feed to lightest cohort to ensure they continue to grow adequately.  These lighter animals are at higher risk of death if they dont continue to grow, even at a slow rate, post weaning.  It is very important that their diet will allow this to occur.  A range of methods are available for collection of weight data with the simplest being the use of NLIS ear tags with automated weighing scales, this allows very high throughput of 1000s of animals per day to be weighed if necessary.  Weighing is also very useful prior to drenching the animals to ensure they receive the right amount of drench - if stock are drafted into weight groups then each group can be drenched based on the heaviest in the group.  This can reduce overall use of drench while also reducing chances of any toxicity if smaller lambs and kids were in a group with much larger animals.
