# APS - L32 - Small Ruminant Management procedures

Outline the process of lambing and kidding
?
Almost always outdoors, although some studs will lamb ewes near sheds and shed them for the first few days post-lambing to ensure lamb survival
On commercial the dams monitor
In dairy, it is in large sheds

T/F There is more dystocia in UK lambing::True

What is tubbing::Where the lambs are given milk directly from their mothers

What are tamed lambs::lambs that are fet separately via bottle because the dam doesn't have enough milk?

What equipment can be used in lambing and kidding::Ropes for traction and a snare to assist the head?

T/F Caesareans are commonly performed on lambs in Australia::False

Why do we match a lamb and a ewe
?
On stud enterprises, it is common for lambs to be tagged or spray marked close to birth to identify them to their dams
Can be identified by blood test too if the rest of the herd is tested
Important since there can be progeny swapping and studs are high value
May mark ewes with large numbers so only have to catch the lamb

## Marking

Outline marking of lambs
?
Ear tags
Castration

What are the numb nuts device::It injects painkillers into sheep

Outline counting of lambs
?
Number of lambs marked to ewes at lambing
If ewes have been pregnancy tested into singles and multiples then this gives a calculation of the loss rate of lambs from pregnancy testing to marking

Outline ear tags in lambs
?
Lightweight
Laser-etched
Extra sharp ping
Covered pin
Room for growth

Outline tail docking in lambs
?
Removal of the tail of many sheep is required to avoid sheep becoming fly struck
The optimal length is the tip of the vulva and is similar to the ram
Now have options for pain relief either oral or injectable
May use a rubber ring, a hot knife (mostly gas-fired) or using a sharp knife
The preferable is the first two
The same shears used for mulesing may be used for tail docking

Outline castration of Rams
?
Reduces aggression and avoids unwanted pregnancies
Reduces ram taint that can occur in meat as ram ages
Often done using rubber rings although you can use a knife or later in age a burdizzo or knife/emasculator combination

Outline mulesing in sheep
?
Mulsing is not needed on poll Dorsets
Merino is subject to fly strike in  either breech or budy
May be done later than marking
Merino Enterprises no longer mules, as they have less wrinkled genetics and use extra chemicals to protect against flies
It removes the skin folds in the breech area and it heals it tights up the remaining folds to reduce wrinkles in the area

Outline vaccination in sheep
?
5 in 1 contains clostridial antigens
6 in 1 is 5 in 1 + cheesy gland
Some flock vaccinate for Johne disease
Only need a single Gudair vaccination (Johne's disease) with no booster
Other sheep vaccines need two vaccinations 4-6 weeks apart with 6-12 monthly boosters
Generally, an 18G needle will be used for small ruminant vaccinations as their skin is much thinner than cattle skin
A second vaccination is normally given at the weaning time

Outline weighing of sheep
?
Weight lambs at marking is unusual
Usually left until weaning as there is no reason to be concerned about growth rates at marking time
More important to reduce stress

Outline the disbudding of lambs and goats
?
Increasing the use of polled genetics reduces dehorning or disbudding but is rare for small ruminants outside certain breeds and dairy. 
If horns are getting close to the animal's eyes or causing problems they may be tipped to remove the dangerous part of the horn as sheep horns can spiral into the eye
If dairy kids have horns should be removed from relatively young

## Weaning

Outline weaning in sheep and goats
?
Dam producing less milk and lamb can damage the udder by sucking overly forcefully
Weaning ewe's udder will often swell up considerably if they are still lactating a lot
Progress to mastitis but will mostly regress over a few days as milk production reduces
Vaccination, drenching, and weighing are key at weaning

Why do we weigh small ruminants at weaning
?
Gives performance data
Draft based on weight o allocate feed
Lighter animals at higher risk of death 
NLIS ear tags with automated weighing scales
Allows you to give the right drench amount

## Post Weaning

Outline the important aspects of post-weaning
?
Must adapt to new diet (although some may be dried off)

Outline regular weighing of small ruminants
?
Assess growth rate by measuring at least every few months
Some flocks animals joined at 1 year of age so growth rates must be high for critical mating weights
Weaned at good body weight (20kg Merino) and growing steady (> 1kg/month) the survival rate is very good
If they are weaned at low body weight or suffer growth setbacks then survival rates drop

Outline faecal egg count and worm egg count
?
Monitor parasite status, especially in high stocking rate
Put into the corner for a few minutes and gather fresh dung
Farmers do their own FEC
Optimal FEC is on weaner lambs as they are more likely to show signs of parasitism so they are a useful "sentinel" mob farm
FEC of goats and sheep useful after 12 months of age unlike cattle

Outline crutching of sheep
?
Performed a few months prior to shearing
Removal of woll from the breech region, including clearance of belly to ensure access to the udder
Lamgs going for sale may be given a bunghole crutch which is a single blow of a piece around the tail /anus to remove any dag (faecal material stuck to the breech area), but minimal wool removal as excess wool removal would reduce the value of skin
Animals that are crushed are far less likely to get fly struck

Outline fibre collection of goats and sheep
?
Could be a significant portion of income
Animals that are shorn are far less susceptible to fly strike

Outline the sale methods of stock
?
Stock can be sold electronically
Physical sale
Direct consigment to abattoir
Forward contracts to pre-Selle a certain percentage of an expected crop of lambs o kids ot lock in  a set price some months in advance

Outline pregnancy testing of sheep and goats
?
Can be done quickly via ultrasound in the flank region
Males are removed 6-7 weeks and this allows foetal ageing and assessing multiple versus singleton pregnancies
Future data is really beneficial
Better survival rates
Pregnancy testing operators bring ultrasound and connect to existing infrastructure and farmer moves sheep

Outline supplementary feeding of sheep
?
Supplementary feeding may be needed throughout the year but most commonly at the start of summer particularly for young stock
Autumn and winter if the autumn break is less than average
Different options depending on cost, availability, and available feed methods
Large hay rolls need a lifting device
The grain feeding device is needed unless it's bagged at the silo
Crops may also be grown especially on the farm to feed animals as well (finishing crops for prime lambs over summer or winter grazing crops)

Outline the condition scoring of sheep
?
1 to 5 for sheep
Dairy goats use a 1 to 8

Outline ram breeding soundness (RBSE)
?
A ram, buck, or billy soundness examination is very similar to a bull breeding soundness exam except for a smaller animal
The scrotal circumference of a ram should be 30cm before they are suitable for breeding
Teeth (checking teeth for age but also how well they meet the dental pad)
Toes - any disease, issues with the structure
Torso - Body condition score or any issues with the structure
Testes - size, firmness, resilience
Tossle - Penis/Prepuce, check for injuries
Temperament - Not often selected directly but is on some studs

Outline artificial insemination and embryo transfer in small ruminants
?
In stud enterprises, it is common for at least some of the ewes to be mated using artificial inseminations, often with external genetics
Embryo transfer is less frequent than AI
AI allows importing high-value sires with low biosecurity risk
ET allows importing specific genetics from sire and dam allowing more rapid genetic progress
Both require ewes to be in good condition with increasing nutrition leading up to joining
2 weeks prior to joining for a range of treatments to get all the ewes at the right reproductive stage
Ewes need to be kept separate from rams to avoid mating
All frozen semen AI uses laparoscopic AI to inseminate the ewes although occasional fresh ai is done via the cervix, the majority are done using frozen semen
Semen is mostly collected at AI centres, some may be on the farm

Outline the checking of teeth in sheep
?
Ensure animal age matches dentition
After age 4 used to determine when the animal will be culled

Outline milk collection of small ruminants
?
Similar to cattle
Some smallholder enterprises milk by hand
Can't use cow machines on small ruminants
Small ruminants give less milk than a cow
Modern dairies are either herringbone or rotary design
Rotary dairies for sheep and goats can be either internal or external milking

Outline live animal appraisal of small ruminants
?
Meat carcass and fat score
Fat score and condition score not the same
