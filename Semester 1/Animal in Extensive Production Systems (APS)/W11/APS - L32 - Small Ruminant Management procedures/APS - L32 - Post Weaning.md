# 11.6 Post weaning

Post weaning is a challenging time for lambs as they fully adapt to a diet without milk, albeit some lambs/kids will not have been getting milk for some time if their dam has dried off (stopped producing milk). 

## 11.6.1  Regular weighing

Following weaning young stock should ideally be assessed for growth rate on a regular basis at least every few months to ensure that they are meeting their growth targets.  In some herds/flocks animals will be joined to give birth for the first time at 12 months of age so growth rates must remain high to meet critical mating weights.  For other stock it is important they continue to grow at steady rates as research has shown that if they are weaned at good body weight (>20kg Merino) and continue to grow each month (at least a kilogram or more) then survival rate is very good.  If they are weaned at a low body weight or suffer growth setback then survival rates drop.

## 11.6.2 Faecal egg count/Worm egg count

For both sheep and goat weaners it is important to monitor parasite status, particularly in environments where there is a relatively high stocking rate. This is relatively simply managed in sheep and goat flocks by moving stock into the corner of a paddock for a few minutes and then picking up some fresh dung to either send to a laboratory for testing or to test on farm.  Some farmers do their own FEC.  The optimal group to check FEC is on weaner lambs as they are more likely to show signs of parasitism first so are a useful "sentinel" mob on the farm.  Unlike cattle the FEC of goats and sheep remains a useful tool after twelve months of age.

## 11.6.3 Drenching & Vaccination

As already noted in section 11.5 most vaccines require six to twelve monthly boosters to stimulate immunity.  For animals that are pregnant it is generally recommended that boosters be given in the month prior to parturition to ensure adequate colostral transfer of immunity to the young.

The adult drench program will vary with species and environment as well as they cohorts of animals on a farm eg. with higher female breeding numbers an increased parasite load tends to be common.  In southern Australia a summer drench program, combined with FEC to assess if it is required is generally practiced.  This involved a drench in December (if needed) and then another in February (if needed) with the goal of reducing the contamintion of pasture over summer with nematode eggs.  The summer heat removes a large number of nematode eggs on the pasture prior to this time meaning there are only low levels of gastrointestinal nematodes remaining.  Occasionally it may be needed to also give a pre parturition drench.

On some goat properties due to challenges around parasite resistance the fungus Duddingtonia flagrans may be added to the diet to assist killing nematode larvae in the faeces.  The fungus is good at trapping the larvae as they hatch so they are not able to migrate and then infect stock.   It does however have to be given on a daily basis but is suitable for small, intensive goat dairies while minimising the use of chemicals. 

## 11.6.4 Crutching

Crutching is generally performed a few months prior to shearing.  It is the removal of wool from the breech region and may also include some clearance of belly well in ewes to ensure lambs have access to the udder.  In lambs going for sale they may be given a bunghole crutch which is a single blow of a handpiece around the tail/anus to remove any dag (faecal material stuck on the breech area) but minimal wool removal as excess wool removal would reduce the value of the skin.  The ewes being moved in the laneway below by a Border Collie have been crutched relatively recently.  Once a sheep or goat is crutched then they are far less likely to get struck by a fly as there is less material for the fly to lay eggs into.

## 11.6.5 Fibre Collection

Fibre collection from sheep and goats is an important part of many enterprises, particularly where the fibre makes up a significant part of enterprise income. The next three videos look at the different methods of shearing in the three enterprise types.  For goat shearing there are a number of potential methods while most Australian sheep shearers use the method shown below.  When a animal is shorn they are far less susceptible to fly strike (both body and breech strike) for a few months post shearing hence doing this leading into bad fly seasons can be advantageous to reduce the risk at that time.

 

 

 

All of the previous methods use mechanical shearing while in some countries and for special show sheep in Australia blade shearing is still practiced with hand shears.

## 11.6.6 Sale methods

Sale methods for stock to go to slaughter mirror those in the cattle industry that have already been discussed.  Stock can be sold via electronic auction such as Auctionsplus, via physical sale (as per the Lamb VR video) or via direct consignment to an abattoir.  Larger enterprises tend to use more electronic sale or direct to abattoir and may use forward contracts where they pre sell a certain percentage of the expected crop of lambs or kids to lock in a set price some months in advance to reduce the risk of large change in pricing. 

## 11.6.7 Pregnancy testing

Pregnancy testing of sheep and goats is generally done using ultrasound via the flank region.  Large numbers of animals can be assessed relatively quickly.  The male should have been removed from the females for 6-7 weeks and this allows foetal ageing and assessing multiple versus singleton pregnancies.  The key benefit of pregnancy testing at this point is having better data on future potential lamb numbers as well as drafting stock to allow more precise feeding to their needs in late pregnancy and lactation.  It also allows better allocation to smaller groups for animals having multiples to enhance progeny survival rates.  NLIS and drafting technology means it is now becoming feasible to draft multiple ways post scanning based on tag into pregnancy status groups as well as how early/late the pregnancy might be eg. could draft into five groups, early single, early multiple, late single, late multiple, not pregnant.  This could be automated once animals have been scanned and enter a 5 way draft system - an autodrafter setup is shown below.

Most pregnancy testing operators bring their ultrasound and sheep handling unit to a property and connect it to infrastructure (yards) that are in place.  It is then a matter of the on-farm manager keeping the sheep up at an appropriate pace to allow the pregnancy testing to be done.  Several sheep can be pregnancy tested each minute, depending on the level of detail required.

## 11.6.8 Supplementary feeding

Supplementary feeding maybe needed at any time throughout the year but most commonly may commence in summer, particularly to young stock.  Then throughout autumn and winter if an autumn break is less than average.  A range of different supplementary feeds may be given depending on cost and availability of methods to feed them eg. large round rolls of hay require some sort of device to lift and feed them out. Similarly some sort of grain feeding device is needed to feed grain unless it is bagged at the silo and fed that way which is highly labour intensive. Crops may also be grown specially on the farm to feed animals as well eg. finishing crops for prime lambs over summer or winter grazing crops.  This will be discussed more under nutrition.

## 11.6.9 Condition score

While changes in bodyweight are very useful to investigate changes over time in adult sheep condition score is a cheap and quick technique that requires minimal infrastructure to do.  It is also not important if sheep are "full" (straight off-feed) or empty (been off feed for several hours). Given sheep and goats have a large rumen it can make a significant difference to bodyweight if they are kept off feed for more than 12 hours (this should be considered when weighing small ruminants over multiple weight collection points).

While the 1 to 5 system is used for most small ruminants dairy goats use a 1 to 8 system in Australia, in much the same way as dairy cattle using similar landmarks.

## 11.6.10 Ram breeding soundness (RBSE)

A ram. buck or billy breeding soundness examination is very similar to a bull breeding soundness examination for a bull but on a significantly smaller animal.  In general the scrotal circumference of a ram should be about 30cm before they are used for joining.  Rams that dont get to 30cm circumference are probably not suitable for breeding, unless they come from a breed with an acknowledged smaller scrotal circumference (this is not seen in Australian sheep breeds).  The 5 (or 6) Ts can be used to remember what is checked:

Teeth (checking teeth for age but also how well they meet the dental pad)

Toes - any disease, issues with structure

Torso - Body condition score or any issues with structure

Testes - size, firmness, resilience

Tossle - Penis/Prepuce, check for injuries

6 T = temperament - not often selected for directly but is on some studs

## 11.6.11 Artificial insemination and embryo transfer

On stud enterprises it is common for at least some of the ewes to be mated using artificial insemination, often using genetics external to the property.  Embryo transfer may also be practiced although generally less frequently than AI.  The use of AI allows importing high value sires that otherwise may not be available with a very low biosecurity risk.  Similarly ET allows importing specific genetics from sire and dam allowing more rapid genetic progress.  Both of these procedures require the ewes to be in good condition with increasing nutrition leading up to joining.  It also required yarding in the two weeks prior to joining for a range of treatments to get all the ewes at the right reproductive stage of their cycle.  Ewes also need to be kept separate from rams when they will be on heat to avoid mating.  All frozen semen AI uses laparascopic AI to inseminate the ewes, although occasional fresh AI can be done via the cervix - the vast bulk of ewes are inseminated using frozen semen.  Semen is mostly collected from rams at AI centres, although on some properties may be collected on farm.  This depends on the biosecurity protocols for semen collection and if it is likely to be exported where specific health requirements and testing must be obtained.

## 11.6.12 Checking teeth

Checking teeth is done to ensure that the animals tag age matches their age according to their teeth.  Once an animal reaches four years of age then teeth assessment is done by how much wear there is and loss of any teeth - this is not to age the sheep but to determine at what age they may need to be culled as once the teeth are not present the animal will likely lose weight more rapidly when there isnt a large supply of grass available.

## 11.6.13 Milk collection

Milk collection for dairy goats and sheep is very similar to dairy cattle milking as it is machine harvested in large herds/flocks although in smallholder enterprises it is common to milk by hand.  The biggest difference is that specific size milking machines are required for goats and sheep with different pulsation and liner sizes so you cant go straight from milking cows to small ruminants.  Each animal also gives a lot less milk than a cow.  Modern sheep and goat dairies may either be a herringbone design or rotary design. 

 

Rotary dairies for sheep and goats can either be internal or external milking.  With the internal system the operator works on the inside of the dairy unit with stock facing outwards while for the external the system is the same as cattle rotary dairies. The advertisement for a particular brand of NZ systems below demonstrates the internal system.  

## 11.6.14 Live animal appraisal

The final management process we need to cover is live animal appraisal.  It is important if sending goats or sheep to an abattoir that the animals can be assessed to meet the needs of the abattoir. An example of a grid and subsequent pricing feedback are given below (note that the grid provided was not the one used to provide feedback as they are different abattoirs but the concept is the same).

![Grid pricing output.png](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/173552/files/13844810/preview)    

As can be seen by these tables the key metrics are carcass weight and fat score.

It is important to understand that while fat score and condition score are related they are not the same measure.

![lamb fat scores.png](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/173552/files/13844812/preview)  

As well as live animal assessment it is important for a manager to be able to convert this into a carcass weight as abattoir grids are based on carcass weight, rather than liveweight.  A range of factors such as wool length and fat score impact on the dresssing percentage as shown in the table below.
