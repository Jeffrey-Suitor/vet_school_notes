# APS - L17 - Nutrition and supplementary feeding

What is set stocking::Stock go in a paddock at start of year and stay there

What is rotational grazing::Stock move from paddock to paddock

What are the benefits of rotational grazing
?
In general rotational grazing based on plant physiology should increase overall pasture production for the year and also quality
Rotational grazing has increased labour requirement per hectare
Rotational grazing reduces uneven grazing pressure and may improve animal response due to higher-quality pasture

How is pasture height an important variable in beef grazing
?
An important determinant of available feed on offer (FOO)
Growth rate impacted by pasture available (and quality) 
ADG increases over relatively low pasture height until meets a point where steers meet maximal growth
Might change the line of a slope by pasture

What are some approximate numbers for maintaining dry cows, pregnant in the last three months cows, and lactating cows if stock is grazing high-quality pasture
?
| Type of stock                     | kgDM/ha required | Pasture height (cm) |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------- |
| Dry cow                           | 1000             | 3                   |
| Pregnant cow in last three months | 1200             | 4                   |
| Lactating cow                     | 2000             | 9                    |

What are some problems that can occur with pastures and beef cattle?
?
A range of dietary problems can occur
Bloat: grazing high-quality pasture with legumes -> frothy bloat
Nitrate poisoning: At certain times of the year some plants have high nitrate (capeweed)
Toxicity: Thousands of plants/weeds that can cause disease, stock can recognise some as being dangerous. Can be caused by pruned garden plants during drought

What is the optimal beef cattle condition score and how does that change throughout the year
?
Optimal CS to maintain cattle at various times of the year
Want animals in the optimal score: not too heavy or light
ideally between 2.5 and 3.5
Depends on the time of year and the lively level of feed in future. It's ok in spring to be at the lower end
CS is an important determinant of when a beef cow will cycle after giving birth = longer time if lower CS
This is a greater challenge for autumn calving and needs supplementary feed (spring calving has increased pasture)

Describe the use of supplementary feed in dairy cattle
?
Need at least 30% roughage in diet (more than what is needed for sheep)  to reduce acidosis
Types of supplements already covered under the general heading grains, hay, silage, straw, and other
Standing feed over summer may also be included in supplementary feed
Takes 3-4 weeks to allow rumen gut microbes to get used to new feds
particularly important when changing to a high-starch diet (grain)

T/F Moving to a high roughage diet quickly is more likely to cause issues than quickly switching to a high starch diet::False, high starch too quickly causes acidosis

When are supplements needed or not needed for beef cattle
?
Supplements might be needed any time through the year (varying with the environment)
Generally associated with low/no production and/or drought
Interaction between condition score/pasture growth rate and pasture availability
Need to consider stocking rate, stock sales, agistment, lease
Need to plan multiple weeks/months in advance
The decision to stop supplements based on budgeting the amount of pasture availability

What key roles do feedlots play?
?
Risk moderation as they have lots of feed available due to the volume grown in Australia
A place to send stock to be finished during droughts

What is an opportunity feedlot::Small, used when grain prices are low and margins on fattening stock are high?

What is the duration of a short feeding program::60 days

What is background stock::animal brought together before going to a feedlot

What is the benefit of background stock::Preventative care can be performed before going to a higher stocking rate which reduces disease and improves performance within feedlot.

T/F Different feedlots have different diets depending on the market the animal is intended for::True
