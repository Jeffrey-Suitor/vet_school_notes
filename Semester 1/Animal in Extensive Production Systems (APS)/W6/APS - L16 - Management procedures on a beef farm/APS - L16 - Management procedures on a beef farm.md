# APS - L16 - Management procedures on a beef farm

## Preweaning Management Tasks

T/F Northern Australian beef is only handled about 2-3 times per year::True

T/F Southern Australian beef is handled less often than Northern beef::False, handled more often

What is dystocia (calving problems)
?
Can be a common problem (varies with genetics and nutrition and sometimes disease)
A mismatch between calf size and cow pelvis (feto-pelvic disproportion)
Can also be how the calf is presented in utero e.g. coming backwards
A common reason for a veterinarian to be called is, the range of tools that can be used to assist the calving process
Sometimes calves are too big to be born naturally so may require a caesarean (done standing under local anaesthetic)
Generally, dystocia in cattle should be low (less than a few %), and more problems in first-calving heifers (less than 10%)

What is some common equipment used in calving
?
Connect ropes/chains to legs (possibly to head)
Some methods to apply force (windlass/jack etc)

Describe the process of calf fostering
?
In any enterprise, there can be a loss of calves in the birthing process or a loss of cows
About 1 cow in 100-200 may also give birth to twins
Sometimes may need to foster a calf onto another cow using the skin of a calf that has died or potentially adding a strong smell to the foster calf and cow's nose
Once the calf suckled a few times cows more likely to accept
Ideally use calves from in your own herd - otherwise biosecurity risk

What are the most common forms of ear tags
?
NLIS tags: breeder, post breeder (orange)
Visual tags: single piece, dual tag (male and female)
Apply in the correct position
Use correct applicator
Several different companies
Preprinted versus marker pen

T/F The male piece of a two-piece tag goes from the back of the ear::True

Where do the tags for cow ears go::Between the two pieces of cartilage in the middle of the cow ear

Why are two-piece tags preferable to single piece tags::More secure

Why are one-piece tags used in feedlots::Less fences

What is ear notching::Using a specialized tool to make a cut in the ear particularly if you've given HGP and Spey. Still required in WA

What is ear tattooing in cattle::tattoo is applied to the inside of the ear. Becoming less common, but it's still common in studs (lifelong ID). Used in addition to NLIS and frequently visual tag and sometimes branding. The animal must be yarded to visualise the tattoo (unless incredibly tame)

When does vaccination in beef cattle usually occur::Before weaning

Describe the vaccination of beef cattle
?
Large range of vaccines around the world
Lesser number in Australia as some are not needed (FMD)
Most vaccinations are given under the skin (subcutaneous) commonly using a 16 or 18G needle
Vaccination needles are generally short whereas needles for intramuscular injection tend to be more than 3cm long. 
The gauge that reports the width of the comes from a wire gauge measuring system

What are the common vaccinations in beef cattle?
? 
Clostridial (often 5 in 1)
Adding in Leptospirosis (7 in 1) (more common in dairy)
Others:
- BRD
- Johnes disease
- Pestivirus
- Pinkeye (common in a feedlot)
- 3-day sickness
- Vibriosis
Generally injected high in the neck under the skin, but give according to label directions
Vaccine generally comes in a pillow pack
Commonly given to a calf 4-6 weeks apart and then yearly (but follow directions)

Describe how and why we do castration in the beef industry
?
Reduces aggressive bull behaviour (bull injury, EHS)
Reduce infrastructure damage e.g. fences
Bulls grow more quickly than steers and have less fat at the same weight
Pain relief is now available (registered)
Ring/knife (+/- emasculator)/Burdizzo are options)

Describe how and why we dehorn/disbud cattle in the beef industry
?
Dehorning beef calves is generally done later than dairy as dairy calves are already in sheds so can be done in small batches
Usually done in conjunction when tagging, castration, vaccination
Variable age, depending on calving period duration and if 1 or more musters
More variable in Northern Australia compared to Southern (generally)

T/F joining period tends to be longer in Northern Australia::True

What are the tools used for dehorning and disbudding
?
Young calves use heat to disbud (<2 months of age)
Dehorning knife
Scoop or cup (<12 months) dehorner
Guillotine, surgical wire, saw
Pain relief

Describe the process of fire branding in the beef industry
?
Mostly done in northern extensive systems - limited access to freeze brand equipment (dry ice or liquid nitrogen)
Each property has its own registered bran to allow lifelong identification
useful in extensive enterprises where the stock may wander e.g. loss of fences during wet season

Where can you brand cattle::neck, rump, shoulder, thigh, twist (the upper rear portion of the animal's hind leg between the pin bone and the hock)

Where is it illegal to brand::Ribs or cheek of cattle

What is drenching
?
Drenching historically = giving product per os
More recently associated primarily with parasite control (by mouth, injection or pour-on)
Different "families" of anthelmintics
Timing of drenching varies between enterprises, less likely on more extensive enterprises due to lower numbers of parasites
Some anthelmintics are short-acting, and some longer
Generally given at the weaning time (and not before)

When is drenching primarily done::at weaning time

Describe what weaning weight is
?
Relatively common to collect weight at weaning, particularly in stud enterprises (EBV)
Assess growth on the dam and the need for further growth
Electronic scale now common using NLIS

Describe the two primary types of weaning and the more preferred choices
?
Yard weaned versus non (weaned via a fence or weaned out of sigh e.g. move to a different property away from dams)
Yard weaning is useful as an education process for young stock, feedlots prefer yard-weaned stock as calmer in that environment
Cows contract with people, vehicles, dogs
Nanny cattle (older cattle) may be used

## Postweaning Management Tasks

After weaning why would you want to draft animals by weight
?
If you are targeting a specific weight or getting ready for a sale
Draft on bodyweight so young can feed differently (smaller heifers more to get the whole herd to ideal critical mating weight (CMW))
Ideally use electronic scales to be able to measure the change of bodyweight over time to meet growth rate needs (CMW or sale weight)

Describe the process of condition-scoring beef cattle
?
Important skill as quick and cheap to do
The reference range for individual and herd
The Australian system is 1 to 5 for beef
Australia is 1 to 8 for dairy
Weighing is better able to monitor small changes but is impacted more by gut fill (or empty)
Differences in a single BCS may equate to 50kg or more hence doesn't pick up small change

Describe a bull breed soundness examination
?
Also known as BBSE or bull check
Physical exam - structure and reproductive tract
Exam tests and scrotal size
Serving assessment
Collection/assessment of semen
Laboratory exam semen
Some of these processes are done at or son after weaning e.g. assess testes

T/F Most commercial enterprises will not have a stud enterprise::True, this is why they will become steers

Describe pregnancy testing as a post-weaning management procedure in beef cattle
?
Important to know which cows are in calf and when (especially in long joining)
If seasonal herd, likely to occur at a similar time each year
Now using ultrasound +/0 manual (including lay operators)
Still acts of Veterinary Science in some states
Generally >6 weeks post-bull removal from the herd

Describe supplementary feeding in the beef cattle industry
?
Significant variation from one enterprise to next
Variety of different feedstuffs depending on local availability
Overall a form of higher energy (often grain base) with roughage
May occur in the paddock, containment areas or feedlot
May need to make decisions on what stock should be retained if supplementary feeding costs are too high compared to the stock value

What is fat scoring
?
Similar to condition scoring but is used to assess readiness for the market segment
Different to condition score (1-6)
Examine the 12 ribs, and the P8 site

What is the muscle score
?
Beef cattle generally have higher muscle scores than dairy
Muscle score used as a descriptor for carcass quality
Beef cattle generally C or greater (varies on breed), dairy cows often D or E
A's are very convex, E's are straight or concave

Describe the pricing grid used in cattle sales
?
Range of sales may occur:
- Prime: ready for the abattoir
- Store: to be fattened elsewhere (farm/feedlot)
Store sales may happen at any age, no need to be "finished" stock
Sales via Auctionsplus direct from the farm (either prime or store)
Sales of prime stock direct to the abattoir - either through an agent or direct
Larger farms and farms based in Northern Australia are more likely to sell directly to an abattoir, via a grid or via Auctionsplus
Smaller farms more likely to sale yard

How do abattoirs compare cattle that are being sold to them
?
Comparing carcass weight to liveweight (dressing percentage)
Varies with time "off-feed"
Need to be able to estimate yield to ensure get cattle at the correct level on the grid (otherwise price penalty)
Weight and fat (and teeth)

Describe the process of freeze branding
?
Freeze branding is very similar to fire brand - same branding device but cold rather than heat
Use liquid nitrogen or dry ice plus alcohol
Leave on white-haired animals longer to remove all hair (similar outcome for appearance to fire brand)
Dark hair turns white
Can be done pre or post wean but if done later brand stays a similar size
