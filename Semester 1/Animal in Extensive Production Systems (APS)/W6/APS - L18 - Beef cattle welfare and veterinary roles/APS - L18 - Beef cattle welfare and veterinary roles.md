# APS - L18 - Beef cattle welfare and veterinary roles

## Beef Cattle Welfare

Describe the changes in beef cattle welfare
?
Significant changes in beef cattle welfare (improvements) over the past fifty years
This will continue to evolve with societal expectations changing once you graduate: social license
Most countries have a range of laws regarding animal welfare that impacts beef cattle production: different between different countries need to know local laws
Two keys areas in Australia:
- POCTA Act (Prevention Of Cruelty To Animals Act)
- Standards and Guidelines

Summarise the Prevention of Cruelty to animals act (POCTA)
?
1986 Commonwealth Act covering animal cruelty in Australia
Regulations pertaining to this act are enforced in each state e.g. Vic Regulations 2019
Entertainment also included e.g. use of cattle in rodeo (which originates from beef cattle handling)
Also governs the use of animals in teaching, such as animals used in animal handling

Describe what Standards and Guidelines refer to in the beef cattle industry
?
Range of different standards and guidelines that apply to the beef industry (these have superseded the earlier Codes of Practice but are similar rules)
Animal welfare standards and guidelines and Land transport of livestock standards and guidelines
A variation on if codes of still in place or standards and guidelines in different states
Standards = enterprise MUST do
Guidelines = enterprise would ideally do to operate at a higher level
lawmakers must consider the range of areas that animals are managed in when designing laws so these are BASE-level requirements e.g. in some areas may be very normal to always castrate before 3 months but may be impractical in Northern Territory

What are 4 controversial practices in the beef industry
?
Live export
Spaying
Castration
Dehorning

Why is live export a controversial practice in the beef industry
?
Compared to live sheep export generally much shorter voyages in the same general temperature e.g. Northern Australia to SE Asia (Indonesia, Vietnam, etc.) - short-haul transport, but there is a limited example of long haul
Fewer welfare risks with shorter journeys in the same environment
Potential differences in slaughter method and particularly livestock handling between different countries (this caused a ban on live cattle export in 2011)
ESCAS put in place to improve confidence in stock slaughter in accordance with OIE (WOAH) requirements - designed to ensure animal welfare, and supply chain control, traceability and allow audit

What is the primary metric we use to measure improvements in animal welfare for live export::Death rate, averages 0.1%

Because the live export death rate is pretty good what other metrics can be used::behavioural indicators and ongoing questions about what to use to measure that

Describe the welfare issues around spaying female cattle
?
Desexing female cattle to stop them from becoming pregnant again and allow them to get fatter for sale
Northern Australia
Generally not performed in southern Australia as fencing is better
Willis dropped ovary technique used (used to be flank spey)

Describe the welfare issues around the castration of beef cattle
?
Very common technique
Until recently done without pain relief but now there are registered products for this (either local anaesthetic or analgesic)
Performed to reduce aggression, reduce infrastructure damage, EHS issues, decrease unwanted pregnancy
Immunocastration (but less marketable)

Describe the animal welfare issues around dehorning in beef cattle
?
Only required for animals that have horns initially, so not needed in polled animals
Polled gene dominant in British Breed
Increased ability to select polled through genomics 
Ideal to do it as young as possible
Pain relief is now available
Part of QA programs

## Roles of Vets in the Beef Industry

What are some of the veterinary roles in or associated with the beef cattle industry?
?
Clinical vet - beef practice only, mixed practice: some times of year relatively busier
Preventative health/production: consulting, management advice e.g. Mackinnon project
Pharmaceutical industry: research, technical and other
Government: multiple levels in the state, national, international
RDCs
Education
Other

Outline the broadness of veterinary roles within the subject
?
Scope to move out of veterinary industry traditional roles and perform other roles with or without relationship to the industry
Veterinary science is a broad-based degree
