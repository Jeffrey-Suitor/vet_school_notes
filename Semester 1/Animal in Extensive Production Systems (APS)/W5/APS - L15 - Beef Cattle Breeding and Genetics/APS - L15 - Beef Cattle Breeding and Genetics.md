# APS - L15 - Beef Cattle Breeding and Genetics

Provide a brief overview of breeding in cattle
?
Without breeding, there are no new animals to restock the herd
Not all beef enterprises have breeding animals, may purely be a fattening enterprise and purchase from other breeders e.g. buy 10-month-old steers and sell 2-year-old steers (low labour costs)
Indonesia imports a significant amount of young Australian animals. as lacks land to produce enough livestock for fattening (significant feed not suitable for human consumption but useful for feedlotting cattle)
The gestation period of about 280 days (most of the year pregnant and some of that time also lactating)
Usually cycle 30-90 days after giving birth (condition score/nutrition, bad condition score + bad nutrition means longer time to return to cycling)
Always wean calves at least a few months before parturition

How many bulls should there be in an enterprise
?
Depends on o bull quality and if they have been assessed
BBSE - Bull Breed Soundness Examination
Common for a veterinarian to do a BBSE, usually a few months pre-joining (allows additional bulls to be purchased)
A serving capacity test might be conducted, or a serving ability
How to allocate? Size of paddock and feed, topography (hills, watercourses, trees, etc.), likely cow cyclicity, environmental conditions (heat/rain etc)
Varies in NT likely 4 bulls per 100 cows and in Vic 203 bulls
Benefits of multisire joining to reduce risk

What is the target CS for cows in South Australia and how does it compare to northern Australia:
?
No lower than 2.5 at calving for autumn
No lower than 2.5 at the start of mating for autumn calving
No lower than 2.0 at calving for spring calving (these cows will get better nutrition than autumn calving)
Similar figures for cows in tropical areas but the time of calving moved, allow extra CS where lack of supplementary feed, ideally CS 3 at calving

What is the critical mating weight (CMW)
?
85% of heifers become pregnant over a 6-week joining period (will vary for each enterprise)
General rule = 60 - 65% of adult body weight
Growth rate required for CMW = (Mating weight - birth weight)/days between birth and mating (600+ g/d for 2 y.o.)

What are the sources of genetics for beef enterprises?
?
Bulls, artificial insemination or embryo transfer (or livestock purchase)
AI and ET are most commonly used by the stud industry, but if bull prices increase the more commercial may use AI
Range of options to synchronise cows to AI on the same day (FTAI)
Identify heat via a range of methods (usually paint or device on tail)
Requires multiple musters of the herd
ET is often used in studies to access entire new lines of genetics that may not be available otherwise
Bull costs currently vary from 5,000 to more than 50,000 many commercial bulls sell in the 10,000 range

What is crossbreeding
?
A range of genetics can be combined to meet a target outcome
If you owned Herefords, could join Angus to stop the need for disbudding/dehorning
Relatively simple to make a change
Some traits however have many genes involved - how do we access them? Breedplan

What is breedplan
?
For traits such as growth, there are many genes involved
Expression is a combination of genes and environment (feed)
We want to be able to assess the genes part of that
BREEDPLAN - BLUP analysis to produce EBVs
EBVs = genetic merit for a particular trait (removes environmental influence, but this is estimated)
Compares results to genetic base in a particular year
Uses actual animal data combined with all relative data and cohort data

What are some key metrics for weight, fertility/calving, carcase, and other used in Breedplan EBVs
?
| Weight            | Fertility/Calving      | Carcase           | Other                |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------- |
| Birth weight      | Scrotal Size           | Eye Muscle Area   | Docility             |
| Milk              | Days to Calving        | Fat Depth         | Net Feed Intake      |
| 200 Day Growth    | Gestation Length       | Retail Beef Yield | Structural Soundness |
| 400 Day Weight    | Calving Ease Direct    | Intramuscular Fat | Flight Time          |
| 600 Day Weight    | Calving Ease Daughters | Carcase Weight    |                      |
| Mature Cow Weight |                        | Shear Force       |                      |
 
What are some of the drawbacks of Breedplan?
?
Doesn't give you full physical information, you still, need to assess the animal e.g. structural traits
Allows faster genetic progress (but choose wisely in case you progress in the wrong direction)
Selection often across an index rather than a single trait

How is genomics used in cattle breeding
?
The challenge with genetics is the need individual animal information to get high levels of accuracy, so need to wait a year or two for some traits such as 400-day weight
Fertility can take decades
Genomics can improve the selection process once the sample is collected - potentially in the first week of life
Thousands of genetic markers (SNPs) assessed from a hair sample
Very beneficial in the stud selection process
Requires a genomics herd/flock to maintain accuracy (phenotype/genotype)

What aspects are important when investing in a bull
?
Structurally sound
Reproductively sound (fertile)
Of superior genetic quality

What are some aspects of structural soundness evaluated in a BBSE::Legs, feet, eyes, general structure, penis, prepuce, sheath

What aspects of the testicles should be assessed during a BBSE?
?
Palpation of scrotal contents
Recognise scrotal abnormalities
Measurement of the scrotal circumference (closely related to daily sperm production)

What characteristics are analysed when examining bull semen
?
Volume, colour, density, motility and per cent normal spermatozoa
Motility: $\checkmark$ indicates bull is fertile and has 60^ or higher progressively forward motile sperm; P indicates a bull may be fertile under natural mating but it is likely his semen is not suitable for freezing
Sperm morphology: good semen should have >70% normal sperm

How do we palpate the internal sex organs in a BBSE::rectal examination

What is the test done to assess a bull's desire (libido) and ability to serve females (serving ability)::Yard test based on the number of times a bull will mount and serve in a set period (usually 20 minutes for Bos indicus bulls and 10 minutes for Bos taurus bulls)

What are the EBVs related to bull fertility and reproduction::Scrotal size, calving ease (daughters), days to calving, milk EBV

What are two often less considered elements of bull breeding::Plane of nutrition and DNA testing
