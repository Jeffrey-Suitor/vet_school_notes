# APS - L13 - Beef Cattle Production Around The World

Provide a summary of Australia's role in worldwide beef production
?
Australia has a relatively small percentage of the international beef cattle herd - about 2%
Second most prominent exporter behind brazil on kilograms shipped
Exported 76% of beef produced
Australia also exported 1.3 million head of cattle worth 1.6 billion AUD mostly to Indonesia and Vietnam

What are the primary markets which Australian beef and veal are exported to::China (27%), Japan (23%), US (21%), Korea (13%), Indonesia (5%), Other(11%)

What are the primary markets for live cattle export for Australia::Indonesia (52%), Vietnam (21%), China (12%), Israel (6%), Russia (3%), Other (6%)

How has the beef market changed over time in Australia::some markets are premium (Japan), and others are commodity markets (Indonesia) - different pricing for different markets. Most Australian beef to Indonesia is in live cattle sales for fattening

Explain the changes in the size of the worldwide cattle herd
?
Limited scope across world to increase beef production
Relative pricing between livestock and crops can change
Minimal extra available land
Opportunity to intensify in some areas
Cyclical nature of beef markets (long gestation and growth part of this, plus environment, plus competition)
Increased production in Africa, South America, and Asia

Outline the dairy genetics in the beef market
?
A varying percentage of dairy genetics in beef production systems around the world
Australia has a relatively low %
Dairy cows have less muscle

Outline how the beef prices change per market
?
Beef pricing varies depending on the quality of individual part of the carcass and overall animal quality
Quality assurance (QA) is important: reliability, safety
More expensive in Japan vs the USA

## Beef Cattle Productivity and Profitability

T/F More southern enterprises in Australia tend to be larger::False, northern enterprises tend to be larger

How many cattle are in Australia and what % is beef::28 million and 90% beef

Compare the global beef versus dairy cattle herd::Eastern Europe many dairy cattle, North America is mostly beef, Australia has more beef, and New Zealand is more dairy.

Compare Australia and other countries in terms of cattle herd sizes::Australia usually has larger sizes, a large herd in one country could be a hobby farm in another, and feed type and genetics push production systems to have higher kilos of live weight

Compare Australia to the global beef cattle herds in terms of cost of production
?
Non-factor = replacement purchases feed machinery and infrastructure maintenance
High labour $, overall lower $ production
Low labour unit per DSE
Primarily grass-fed
Australia is a relatively low cost to produce cattle even with higher labour costs

Compare the live weight gain of Australian cattle to global cattle
?
Large variation in gain, particularly on feed type (energy/protein)
Daily live weight gain (grams/day)
Primarily pasture-based system in Australia

Compare Australian profit margin vs global farming profit margin::Australia tends to do fairly well but likely isn't turning a profit unless including land appreciation

How do the top 20% of producers compare to the average::top 20% who do small things well? GM/DSE doubled in the top 20% and more than double GM/ha (higher SR), also important to do a calculation per 100mm of rainfall so as to remove the benefits of rainfall
