# APS - L14 - Beef Cattle Production Systems

Where is the localization of beef cattle in Australia
?
Australia is a large country with differing environmental zones
Soil type, rainfall, irrigation, temperature, etc. that impact pasture growth and type of pasture
Can't assume because a system works in south Australia that it would work well in northern Australia (Brahman more in north, British more common in south )
| Region     | Cattle (million) |
| ---------- | ---------------- |
| WA         | 2                |
| NT         | 2.1              |
| SA         | 1                |
| Queensland | 11.3             |
| NSW        | 4                |
| Victoria   | 3.6               |
| Tasmania   | 0.7              |


Describe Bos taurus (British) versus Bos Indicus (Brahman)
?
Further North you go in Australia more likely to find Bos indicus type cattle e.g. Brahman
Brahman deal with fleas, heat, and ticks better than Bos taurus

What are some unique features of bos indicus that help them to better manage their climate
?
Floppy ears
Hump with fat and not bone
Dewlap in front of legs
Deeper sheath (if too low can cause damage to the penis) and navel (scores for this)
Coat (shorter and shinier), less hairy
Not visually obvious but Brahman can kick higher

How do we classify cattle breeds
?
Cattle breeds are often classified by origin or temperature/tropical types
- British breed
- European breed
- Tropical
- Other
Important to identify breeds so you can avoid calling them the wrong breed in front of the owner

Outline the arrival of Bos indicus
?
Brahmans arrived in QLD in the 1930s via CSIR
Better able to cope with heat and ticks
Brahman genetics in approximately 50% of the national herd, mostly in the northern half of the continent
More than 70% of bulls north of the tropic of Capricorn are Brahman infused
Gilruth was responsible for the original recommendation
Belmont promoted the research into Brahman which saw widespread adoption shortly after

How many heads of cattle does Australia usually have::25 million

T/F There are more dairy breeds than beef breeds of cow::False, there are more beef breeds

What are the top 5 beef cattle breeds in order::Angus, Brahman, Wagyu, Herefords, Santa Gertrudis

Why are there so many breeds of beef cattle compared to dairy
?
When we talk dairy cattle very limited breeds, but also in a very defined area
Range of niche markets for beef and range of environments
Lower infrastructure costs for beef
Shifts in preferred beef breed type over time - a significant change to black cattle
British breed registration is dominated by Angus, Hereford, Shorthorn, Murray Grey, and Red Angus
Tropical breed registrations by Brahman, Droughmaster, Santa Gertrudis, Brangus
New breeds include Speckle Park which has increased rapidly
Very helpful to be able to identify breeds

Outline the mixed breeding used in cattle and what the benefits may be
?
Not all cattle are purebred
Crossbred has a number of potential benefits
Can crossbreed Bos indicus and Bos taurus (technically subspecies)
Can vary the percentage of Bos indicus to environment common to have 3/8 or 5/8 Bos indicus (Brangus, Braford, Charbray, etc.), lower percentage further south
Crossbreeding utilises hybrid vigour
Simple two breed cross or can be far more complex with long-term multiple breeding programs

How would we create a black baldy and white::Angus mated to a Hereford or vice versa? Black cow with a white face, often Angus herds may join young female first few times to Angus then to terminal sire such as Charolais - all progeny from that mating to be sold, none kept as replacements
Most commonly see 3 or maybe 4 breeds maximum in the breed program

## Selecting A Production System

What important aspects must be considered when examining production systems?
?
Depends on the farm environment and pasture growth rate
What markets are available (butcher is a lower condition score, while long-going export is a higher condition score)
Is enterprise to target a finished market or sell "store" animals
Some types of cattle will only meet a limited number of markets, while others may fit several
Flexibility can be beneficial (with variable seasons)

What is the variation between breeds and why is it important
?
Every breed has a lot of variation eg. the Lowline breed was established from selection within Angus
Trangie herd based on 3 Angus lines based on yearling growth rate (high, low and control)
Also significant variation between breeds
Easiest seen in coat colour, but this isn't important in the final beef product (maybe important for rugs, etc.)
Number of important meat characteristics you cant observe externally IMF (marbling), can still select for this

What are some important characteristics of cattle noted in abattoirs?
?
Body number/lot number
Carcase weight - important in determining a weight for maturity
Sex - male or female
Tropical breed content - the hump height is measured to guarantee the accurate eating quality grade (< 25%)
Hanging method - determined as being either Achilles hang or tenderstretch
Hormonal growth promotants - will affect the MSA score obtained for different muscles
Ossification - measured to determine carcase maturity
Marbling - using both the MSA and AUS-MEAT measurement systems
Rib fat - a minimum of 3mm is required, measured at the AUS-MEAT standard site. The overall fat cover is also assessed including any hide puller damage
pH and temperature - pH is measured using a pH meter and must be below 5.71. The temperature should be below $12\textdegree C$ according to AUS-MEAT standards

What is a senepol::tropically adapted Bos taurus (slick coat gene) - derived from a cross between Red Poll and N'Dama (from Senegal), hence the name

What is a tuli cow::tropically adapted Bos taurus breed (cream colour)

How can we improve the meat quality of a cow::bos taurus infusions

What is the maximum allowed bos indicus to meet the maximum meat quality standard in Australia::25%

What is the frame score
?
The overall size of cattle is determined by the frame score
Measured from 1-10
Can assess by measuring hip height versus their age
Later maturing animals have higher frame score
British breed tend to be 1-7, Euro 4-9
High frame score = high DSE

What is the optimal frame score for domestic, export short fed, and export long fed
?
| Market    | Frame score |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Domestic | 3-5         |
| Short fed | 4-6         |
| Long fed  | 5-7         |
