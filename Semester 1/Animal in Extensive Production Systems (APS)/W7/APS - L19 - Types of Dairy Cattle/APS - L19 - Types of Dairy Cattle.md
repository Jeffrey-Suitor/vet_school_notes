# APS - L19 - Types of Dairy Cattle

When are male (bobby) calves sold::5-7 days as meat

What is a mop up bull::Farmers use AI and then bulls to get any they mised

When are cows fertile::When in oestrus, which starts every 3 weeks

When does the ideal cow calve::2 years of age, with 300 days lactate and dried off for 50 days

What are the two most common types of dairy cattle in Australia::Holstein-Friesians (Black and White, Large, Produce a large milk volume and are the most productive breed) and Jersey (golden with dark face, large proportion of fat)

What are some less common dairy cow breeds in Australia?
?
Aussie Reds
Ayrshire
Illawarra
Brown swiss
Guernsey

What are the classes of livestock on dairy farms
?
Calves (cows that are still drinking milk)
Heifer (an animal that has been weaned but hasn't calved)
Milking cow (producing milk, large udders)
Dry cows (pregnant but not producing milk, small udders)
Bulls (male cows that are sometimes present to help get the cows pregnant)
Beef bulls (male animals are reared up for later slaughter)

How does calving differ in beef and dairy
?
In dairy, the calves are separated from the mother not long after birth. Male calves are often sold as veal or into beef production early in their lives as they do not lactate. (Booby calves)

How does the cow stop producing milk::Produces 300 days a year. Will be pregnant and lactating but at a certain stage of pregnancy they will stop lactating. 

What is a guernsey cow
?
From isle of guernsey
Fawn in colour with white markings
Milk is a distinctive golden colour
22 litres per day
By age 3 way 600 kg

What is an Ayrshire
?
From the county of Ayr in Scotland
Known for the ability to adapt
Milk is high in proteins
Colour varies from light to deep cheery red, mahogany, brown, or a combination of those colours with white

What is a jersey
?
From the island of Jersey
Second most common breed
Milk is creamy and good for butter
Fawn in colour with black tips on their muzzles, ears, feet and tails
Jerseys are the smallest of all dairy cows and can weigh up to 500kg

What are Aussie Reds
?
Breed in Australia by combining Scandinavian Red with other Australian Red breeds such as Illawarra and Ayrshire
Medium size and mainly red in colour with white markings
An extremely hardy breed that produces milk with a high protein and medium milk fat content

What is an Illawarra
?
Developed in the Illawarra region of NSW
Rich red in colour with little white on the flanks
Illawarra cows produce large quantities of milk; more than 40 litres per day

What is a Holstein
?
Form Northern Europe
Mainly black and white
Most popular breed in the world and Australia (1.4/1.65 million are Holstein in Australia)
Large quantities of milk (10000/year)
Holsteins are one of the largest dairy animals at over 1.5 m tall and 600kg in weight and bulls at 1.8 meters tall and 1000kg

What is a brown swiss
?
From siwtzerland
One of the most common breeds
Solid brown in colour varying from very light to dark
Brown swiss were bred for adaptability to any country side with high protein and a high quantity of milk produced.
Excellent milk for cheese

Outline the life cycle of a dairy cow
?
1. Born (Holstein 41 kgs, Jersey 26kgs)
2. Colostrum
3. Female calves: approximately 6 weeks for eartagging and disbudding
4. Male calves sold as bobby calves (>5D) or vealers approximately 8 - 9 months
5. 12 weeks of weaning
6. Heifer rearing
7. Approx 15M joined (A.I or Bull)
8. Dry period (8 weeks)
9. 24 M calving, then 36, 48, 60 etc.
10. Joining (83 DIM)
11. Milking (20-40L, Breed and diet dependent)
12. Culled (typically 4-7 YO)

## Parturition

What are the 3 stages of parturition?
?
1. Cervical dilation and contraction
2. Delivery of newborn
3. Expulsion of membranes

When to intervene
?
1st stage of labour > 6 hours
2nd stage > 2 hours or slow or no progression
Amniotic sac hanging out for 2 hours

What are the issues we can have with caling
?
Cow health
- Pregnant again
- Current health
- Milk production
Calf health
- Viability? Suckling?
- Colostrum
- Death?
- Susceptibility to disease
Management / Prevention
- Genetics?
- When to intervene? 
- Age/size at calving
- Nutrition

Describe the fat of calves born on a dairy farm
?
Born alive
Non-viable calves
Bobby calves sold
Late and unsuitable calves sold
Potential replacements (20-40% replacements per year)

Outline the process of successful calf rearing
?
Colostrum
Nutrition
Housing/Shelter

What is the colostrum
?
Milk from the FIRST MILKING after calving
Provides energy and antibodies
They need 4 litres within 6 hours (depending on quality)
Many calves get less
Colostrum quality varies
Colostrum in the first 6 hours is the most important thing you can do to prevent diseases later on

What are the 3 Qs of Colostrum management?
?
Quality: 50mg/L
Quantity: 4L
Quickly: 6 hours (antibody absorption decreases overtime)

Why do calves get sick
?
Birth weight 30-35 kg (small)
The traumatic transition of birth (anoxia, trauma, misadventure, poor suckling reflex)
Immature immune systems (passive immunity, poor immune response)
Low energy reserves (starvation, dehydration, temperature)
Developing anatomy and physiology (monogastric to a ruminant, cardiovascular, etc.)
Group housing

## Rearing Calves

What are the 4 elements of successful elements of calf nutrition?
?
Milk: As little as possible, but not less! 10% BW
Concentrates: grain or pellets, causes rumen development (3/4 kg per day to wean)
Roughage: Hay or silage, poorer quality
Water: ad-lib, high off the ground

Important to feed pellets to cause changes to make the stomach not monogastric

When can you wean calves off milk
?
Individual calves are eating 0.75-1kg concentrates
Small groups are averaging 1-1.25 kg per day
The age of weaning is determined by the calf rearing setup (ranges from 4 weeks and up)

Why feed pellets over grass when young
?
Grass doesn't digest well when young because of cellulose and hemicellulose
Grass contains mostly water.

Outline the shelter required for calving
?
Clean, comfortable
Pen size and design (make sure largest enough and that calves aren't squashed together, more disease)
Bedding (needs to be clean, dry, cleaned often, sawdust, soaks up urine, calves can lick and bite at bedding when bored)
Ventilation(pee contains ammonia, poor ventilation means they inhale pneumonia, calves can do well in cold)
Food and drink facilities (Ensure that the calves are eating enough)
Biosecurity (diseases aren't brought in)

How do we reduce the risk of disease
?
Minimise problems at parturition
- Dam nutrition
  - Colostrum (5 weeks pre-calving)
  - Affects calf size and viability
- Pre-calving vaccinations
  - Presence of ABs during dry period = Ab in colostrum
- Sire selection and mating
  - Calving ease
  - Heifer size at first mating (260 kg Jersey, 340 Holstein)
Support the development of healthy calves
- Colostrum
- Adequate nutrition
- Hygienic environment
- Minimise stress: mixing, transport, changes in feed

Preweaning nutrition is very important to ensure that calves can become successful cows

What is a fortified milk program::Calf milk is mixed with water, and instead, add it to whole milk, which increases the number of total solids. Requires that each animal has to be individual

When a heifers joined::15 months of age

What is the estimated cost of rearing a heifer::1300 to 1500

What is the replacement rate of the herd::20-40% of the herd
For a 400-cow herd with a 25% replacement rate, how much will it cost the farmer::100 cows at 1500 each

How big should heifers be::85% of mature bodyweight at calving (target weights)

What is the ideal heifer
?
Gets in calf quickly as a heifer
Calves without problems
Produces well
Gets back in calf
Lots of time
Recoups her rearing costs quickly
Heifers that meet their target weights do these things better

Why is it important to make their target weights
?
Production: cows produce 7 litres of milk extra for each 1kg BW at calving
Fertility: puberty is related to body weight, so bigger heifers are more fertile at joining
Fertility after calving bigger heifers compete better and get in calf quicker
Longevity - they last longer in the herd as well. There are fewer calving difficulties

What are the ideal heifer benchmarks
?
90% in calf after 6 weeks of joining
Calve at 22 to 26 months of age
85% to 90% mature body weight at calving (which will vary with production level)
First calver 100-day in-calf rate of 60% (year-round) or a 6-week in-calf rate of 75%
Production of heifers vs mature cows should be 85%
The ratio of second calvers to first calvers should be >85%

What is important when considering the nutrition needs of heifers
?
Weaning to 9 months, nutrition is key
A diet high in energy and protein
9 months to joining (15 months)
Less energy and protein than younger heifers but a rising plane of nutrition

What is the ideal time range for rearing calving::2 years
