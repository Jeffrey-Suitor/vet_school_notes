# APS - L21 - Annual Management Calendar Dairy (Husbandry and Milk Quality)

Outline horned vs hornless cattle
?
Can cause more severe injury to other cattle, especially in yards, feedlots and transport
Can damage hides and cause bruising
Are harder to handle in yards and crushes
Can be potentially more dangerous to handlers
Require more space at feed troughs and on cattle trucks
Are not as Tractable and quiet to handle
Few polled genetics in dairy currently - but it is increasing

Outline disbudding vs dehorning in cattle
?
Disbudding = removal of horn BUDS before horn attached to skull (6-8 weeks)
Dehorning = removal of horn after this stage (more invasive - greater nerve and blood supply)

What is preferred disbudding or dehorning::disbudding

What are the methods of disbudding
?
Veterinary disbudding: sedation, local anaesthetic, cautery disbudding, long-acting pain relief. Results in 1.4 kg greater growth in the following 2 weeks compared with no sedation or pain relief
Contractor disbudding: usually cautery disbudding. May use tolfegesic (topical) NSAID as pain relief - Efficacy?
Also excision methods - scoop dehorner or knife - are not recommended by vets or Dairy Guidelines

Outline dairy identification
?
NLIS tags
Farmers also add farm tag which is easier to read
Dry ice freeze brand

Outline dairy cattle parasite control
?
Gastrointestinal worms and flukes, lungworms, ticks, lice
"Drenching"
Treatment - pour on, injectable or oral drenches
Adult - generally resistant to worms - drenching is a problem
Young - from 12 weeks of age. Drench heifers every 6-12 weeks from weaning to 8 months

Outline the vaccinations we give cattle
?
Diseases of cattle 
Diseases of humans (lepto)
Diseases of calves
Different types of vaccine
Different programs

Outline bull management on dairy farms
?
Even when farmers use AI need mop up bulls
Bulls may be needed for >50% of the pregnancies (average AI success rate 30-50%)
Need to be sound - not lame, fertile, no penis dysfunction
Need enough for the number of cows to be mated
Because cows walk every day need "teams" of bulls that can be rotated

What is the number of bulls in split-calving herds
?
3 bulls for every 100 cows (AI used)
4 bulls for every 100 cows (AI + synchrony)
6 bulls per 100 cows (no AI)

How many bulls are needed in year-round calving herds
?
2 bulls for every 100 milking cows

Outline bull check fertility testing in Australian bulls
?
Scrotum
General physical examination
Crush side semen evaluation
Serving ability testing
Sperm morphology testing
A measure of risk
- Tick
- Qualified
- Cross
- Not Tested

Outline pregnancy diagnosis in dairy herds
?
Essential to monitor reproductive performance
Allows identification of "empty" cows
Differentiates between AI and natural service pregnancies
Foetal ageing allows farmers to plan dry-off date
Manual (rectal) - palpation or ultrasound
- Most accurate
- Can determine foetal age (most accurate between 5 and 15 weeks pregnancy (6 for ultrasound))
Laboratory (blood or milk)
- Quite accurate at identifying pregnant cows
- Less accurate at identifying empty (non-pregnant) cows
- Unable to age foetus

Outline condition scoring in cattle
?
Cows can change weight rapidly
10% bodyweight change in a milking
The fat cover is much more consistent
Condition score is related to disease and fertility
One condition score = 3000 MJ or 270kg feed
Condition score dairy cattle out of 1-8
Very few 1, 2 ,7, or 8 so in practical terms scores are between 3 and 6
2 step "hands-off" scoring method only takes seconds
1. Look at pins, is the area deeply sunken, sunken, slightly sunken, or filled in
 2A. If the  area is deeply sunken are the insides o fthe  pins hollow
 2B. If the  area between the  tail and pins is sunken, look at the  backbone is it flat or bumpy
 2C. If the  area between the  tail and pins is slightly sunken, look at the  depression between the  hip and pin, is it U shaped, shallow, or flat

What percentage of Australian dairy farmers do ICCC testing::40%

What is mastitis::inflammation of the mammary gland

How do we measure milk quality
?
Normal components of milk
- Protein
- Fat
- Volume
Abnormal components of milk
- Cells
Contaminants of milk
- Bacteria
- Sediment
- Water
- Inhibitory substances
Temperature

Outline payment for quality of milk
?
Normal components of milk
- Protein ($9 per kg)
- Fat ($4 per kg)
- Volume (small negative charge 2c / L)
  - Milk is typically about 4% fat, 3.2% protein
  - Milk price is often described as kg Milk Solids or c/L
- Lactose does not pay farmers
Abnormal components of milk
- Cells (penalties)
Contaminants of milk (penalties)
- Bacteria
- Dirt
- Inhibitory substances)
- Temperature (penalties if too low)

Outline the cells in bovine milk
?
Bulk milk cell count (BMCC)
- Cells in the vat
Individual cow cell count (ICCC)
- Cells from an individual cow
Types of cells not differentiated when counted
Leukocytes are bad
BMCC - "Premium milk"
- < 250 000 cells per ml
ICCC
- Normal = 50 000 - 250 000 cells per ml
- In mastitis can rise to several million cells/ml

What is mastitis
?
Infection of the udder
The most important disease in dairy medicine
Most common dairy cattle disease
Most economically important disease to the dairy industry
- Reduced milk production
- Loss of BCS
- Poorer milk quality (reduced payment)
- Cull cattle
- Cost of treatment
- Antibiotic use

Outline the types of mastitis
?
1. Not Infected
  1. Bacteria outside the udder
2. Subclinical
  1. Bacteria inside the udder
  2. High ICCC, changes to milk chemistry
  3. Cow fighting an infection
3. Clinical
  1. Obvious changes to milk
  2. No obvious changes to the cow
    1. Outside the udder
4. Toxic
  1. Obvious changes to the cow

Outline herd testing
?
Processors evaluate bulk milk quality/quantity at each collection
Farmers can also monitor individual cows periodically for 
- Milk production
  - Litres
  - BF (kg and %)
  - Protein (kg and %)
- Individual cow cell count (ICCC)
  - Subclinical mastitis detection
Less than 50% of Australian herds 'herd test'

What are the strategies for controlling mastitis
?
Rapid identification and treatment of clinical cases
Minimising environmental contamination
Minimising spread during milking
Maintaining teat end and teat skin health
Using effective Dry Cow Therapy

Outline rapid identification and treatment of clinical cases
?
Missed cases can quickly elevate BMCC
Targets:
- No more than 5/100 cows in the first 14 days of lactation
- No more than 2/100 cows per month in subsequent months of lactation
Remove from vat - treat or cull (if 3 or more cases of this lactation)

How to minimise environmental contamination for mastitis
?
Gateways
Water troughs
Laneways and tracks
Dairy entrance
Dairy exit
Feed pads
Calving pads

Minimising spread during milking
?
Maintain milking machines
- Vacuum
- Pulsation
- Rubberware
Avoid under or over milking
milker hygiene (gloves)
Post-milking teat disinfection (teat spraying)
Segregate infected cows

Outline teat sealants and dry cow therapy
?
Teat sealants - seal the teat canal at the end of lactation
Dry cow therapy - long-acting antibiotic preparation
Infused into each quarter immediately after the last milking of the season
Main actions
- Treat existing infections
- Prevents infection during the dry period
- Also helps develop keratin plug

There are many aspects of health and management on a dairy farm in which vets are involved.

“Fire engine” or more emergency medicine may often be carried out by the newly graduated vets. In dairy practice, the most common calls are usually:

-   Lame cows
-   Dystocias (and periparturient issues)
-   Acute disease (including clinical mastitis and sick calves)
-   Accidental injuries (cows occasionally jump fences and their udders don’t fare well!)

As dairy vets become more experienced, they tend to transition into more of the herd health and advisory aspects of dairy medicine. These include:

-   Mastitis prevention and control
-   Reproductive performance/ fertility (including pregnancy diagnosis and VBBSE)
-   Nutrition advice (eg Transition Cow Management)
-   Lameness prevention
-   Disease prevention
-   Biosecurity
-   Financial advice
