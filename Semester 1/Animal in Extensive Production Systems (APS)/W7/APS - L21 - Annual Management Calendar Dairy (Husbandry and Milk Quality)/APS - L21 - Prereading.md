While nutrition and breeding management are extremely important aspects of a profitable dairy farm, there are many husbandry and preventative health procedures and tasks that are equally if not more important. Some of the key tasks covered in this section are:

-   disbudding of calves,
-   identification of animals,
-   parasite prevention,
-   body condition scoring,
-   pregnancy diagnosis, and
-   bull management.

Veterinarians are involved in the dairy industry at many levels.

Private practitioners provide “fire brigade” and “herd health” services on farm.  Some veterinarians provide “consultancy advice” about nutrition, farm management, breeding, grazing and finances to both farmers and RDCs such as Dairy Australia and Meat and Livestock Australia.
