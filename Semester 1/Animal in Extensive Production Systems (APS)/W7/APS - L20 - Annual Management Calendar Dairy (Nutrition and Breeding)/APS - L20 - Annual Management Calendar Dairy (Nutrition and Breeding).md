# APS - L20 - Annual Management Calendar Dairy (Nutrition and Breeding)

This session will outline some of the major areas of management on a typical Australian dairy farm, and how they fit into the annual calendar.

In a seasonal calving herd the key areas to focus on are optimising the herd’s calving pattern, so that peak lactation aligns with the peak of the pasture growth curve. Additionally, a well-run farm will harvest excess pasture and conserve it as hay or silage in order to supplement the cow’s feed during periods of low pasture growth. Although the more profitable farms in Australia maximise the use of home grown fodder, supplementary feeding of grain is often required however to maximise milk production (especially in the Holstein Friesian cow, which has been bred to respond to a larger input of feed with increased milk production).

The breeding plan on a dairy farm is extremely important, and this includes strategic “lead” feeding, or transition cow management prior to calving. In order to join a cow at the right time, a farmer must determine when she is in oestrus, referred to as “heat detection”. The calving pattern of the herd is very important to the profitability of the farm.

In a seasonal herd, there are some key metrics that show the farmer how good his herd’s fertility is. These are the 3-week submission rate, the 6-week In Calf Rate, the Conception rate (to A.I.) and the Not In Calf Rate.

A large number of dairy farms in Australia follow a “split” or “batch” calving pattern, where the herd calves in 2 (or more) separate groups. In some cases, this has been employed by farmers to maximise milk payments in the off-season, when the purely seasonal herds’ production drops off. However, on a non-irrigated farm, it will mean that the cows in the group (or groups) that calved at a drier time of year will need more supplementary feed. In many cases it has been shown that this is less profitable than a seasonal herd with a tight calving pattern. Smaller numbers of Australian dairy herds calve in a year-round pattern. In most cases these are herds in areas that are irrigated, and there are increasing numbers of housed cow dairy farms appearing, which also employ a year-round calving pattern.

Note that although general farm maintenance and improvement will not be covered in this section, it is an important input on all farms. Aspects such as milking shed and laneway maintenance are important from an animal health and milk quality perspective and can easily lead to costly herd problems if not addressed by the farmer.

Additionally, pasture improvement will not be covered (as you will have learned about this in earlier modules) but aspects such as superphosphate application are also important in dairy enterprises.

When should calving be focused::So peak lactation aligns with peak pasture growth curve

What will a well run farm do with excess pasture::Harvest and save for later

T/F Australia fodder is typically enough for dairy cows::False, more efficient farms will maximise fodder use but maximum milk production typically requires additional feed

What is the term for determining when a cow is in oestrus::Heat detection

What are the key metrics farmers should follow to assess herd fertility::3 week submission rate, 6 weeks In Calf Rate, Conception rate (to A.i>0 and the Not in Calf Rate)

What is a split or batch calving pattern::2 separate calving in herds although this has been shown to be less profitable

Outline the process of rotational grazing
?
Cows are separated into different paddocks and are rotated between them

A higher-producing cow herd would likely be made up of what type of cow::Holstein Friesian

How much additional grain would a low-producing and high-producing farm provide as extra feed for a cow in a day::5-15kg

What is the food pyramid for cows
?
Additives (macrominerals, trace elements, etc)
Concentrates (cereal grains, legumes, pellets, "meals", lollies)
Forages (Gray, Hay, Silage)

What are Hay, Silage, and Straw
?
Dairy farmers may conserve feed or buy it
Hay - dried pasture
Silage - fermented pasture (in airtight storage)
Straw - dried (mostly cereal) crop after harvest

Outline the process of Haymaking
?
Hay needs to be dried down to 15% moisture or less
Haymaking process
- Mow paddock when there is plenty of grass
- Dry, Rake, Bale
- It needs to be dry enough!
Costs can vary depending on the scale
Starts at $50 per tonne for the whole process
Grass, Legume, or Cereal base
Energy and protein vary - need to feedtest it

Outline the silage-making process
?
Forage mown/cut
Allowed to dry quickly (60%-70% Dry matter)
Baled and wrapped or chopped and stacked
Bacteria convert Water Soluble Carbohydrates to fermentation acids, ideally lactic acid.
This needs to happen quickly to rapidly lower the pH
Some plants make better silage than others

Outline the process of grass growth
?
Grass grows in proportion to photosynthetic area
To grow the most, let it grow the fastest
Rotational grazing
- Put cows onto pasture at 12cm (24kgDM/ha)
- Take them out at 4cm (1200 kgDM/HA)
- Pasture wedge
If we base the decision to put a cow in a paddock on pasture height, then the time between consecutive grazings of a single paddock will depend on the grass growth rate.

Outline how we measure growth rates
?
In Warrnambool, grass growth rates vary with the season
Farmer can
- measure growth rates
- use historical data
- Use data from local demonstration farms

Outline the calculation of rotational grazing
?
Rotational length = ("In" - "Out") / Growth rate)

Outline the process of practical grazing management
?
Decide desired production level of cows
Workout required intake
Use growth rates to work out rotation length
Work out % of the area to be grazed daily
Calculate KGDM/Cow from grass
Balance ratio with supplements
Rules of thumb
- Most diets average 10MJ KG/DM
- Cows require 5MJ to produce 1 L of milk and 6 MJ for maintenance
- Cows need 1/2 Litres + 6 KG DM per day

What are concentrates in dairy cattle?
?
Often fed in the dairy
Cows can eat 10kg grain without a drink
Many different feedstuffs are available
Protein, Energy, Fibre, and trace elements can be "balanced"

## Transition Cow Management

Outline the transition period
?
Energy 
- The amount required yesterday = 6-7 MJ
- If she produces 20 litres
- Energy require tomorrow = 17 MJ
Calcium
- before calving, a cow deposits 8-12 g per day to the foetus
- After calving, Milk contains 12g per litre
Transition period
- 4 weeks before to 4 weeks after calving
- Diet during this time is a major determinant of health and reproduction

T/F Cows enter energy deficient for a few days after calving which will consume fat reserves::True

What are the benefits of the transition period
?
It was discovered that pre-calving nutrition could be used to prevent milk fever
It was then discovered that pre-calving nutrition could be used (or case) nearly everything else

What is the Dietary cation-anion difference?
?
Diets are electrically neutral with a balance of cations and anions
Strong ions are ones that are highly bioavailable and not metabolised
DCAd = (Na + K) - (Cl + S)
Less i more
"Anionic salts" added to the diet
- Ammonium chloride (NH4Cl), ammonium sulphate (NH4)2SO4, CaCl2, calcium sulphate (CaSO4), magnesium chloride (MgCl2) and magnesium sulphate (MgSO4)
Very small changes in blood pH
Measurable changes in urine pH
Small changes in blood pH can have large effects on parathyroid hormone receptivity and ultimately the risk of clinical milk fever

What is the name of the supplements given to cows before they calve::lead feed?

What happens when you do not properly heat detect
?
Poor reproductive efficiency
Longer calving intervals and disrupted calving patterns
Fewer replacements
A loss of production
Lost farm income

How many people should be trained in heat detection::Everyone on the farm

How many people should be responsible for heat detection::At least 1 and they should spend 15 to 20 minutes twice a day observing cows

T/F Heat observation should only occur when cows are in their naturally relaxed state::True

Do cows show heat signs during the hottest parts of the day::No really

The rigidity of the ground is important in cow mounting behaviour::Yes

When doing heat detection being able to identify cattle is important::Yes

What are the primary signs that identify a cow as being in heat
?
Standing heat (ovulation occurs 24-30 hours after) (standing heat varies from 4 to 24 hours with an average of 8 to 12 hours)

What are the secondary signs of cows in heat?
?
Cows that mount other cows
Cows licking other cows
Head butting
Sniffing other cows and allowing them to be sniffed
Pacing fencelines
Lips of the vulva become pink and swollen with clear mucous discharge
May not let down milk or lower milk production
Ruffled hind air
Mud on the hind due to the mounting of other cows

T/F once a day AI will result in substantially lower insemination::False

## Genetic improvements

Which issues have arisen from heavily selecting for milk production, particularly in the North American Holstein breed
?
Inbreeding has increased
Selected against fertility
The Australian dairy industry trying to reverse this trend with an emphasis on fertility traits in breed value

What is the aim of a dairy farm business?
?
Maximise profit by efficiently producing and selling milk and stock

What is fertility
?
Reproductive efficiency
In breeding enterprises, when an animal becomes pregnant is very important
Giving birth is necessary for:
- Producing offspring where they are sold
- Starting a lactation for milking animals

What is genetics
?
Having high-quality animals
Cattle can have different genes suitable for a particular purpose

What are the KPIs for seasonal split-calving herds
?
Primary KPIs
- 6 week in calf (pregnancy) rate
- Not in calf (empty) rate 
Factors affecting 6 week in-calf rate
- 3-week submission rate
- A.I. conception rate
Factors affecting not in calf rate
- 6 week in-calf rate
- Bulls

Why is reproduction in the cows and for a farm
?
Cows calve at the right time for the farm
They produce more milk and get in calves quicker
More AI replacement calves
Farms can use mop-up bulls to get cows that fail to inseminate from AI
1% change in 6 week in-calf rate, 3-4 dollars per cow

What are the KPIs in year round herds
?
Overall performance
- 100 day in calf rate
- 200 day in calf rate
Drivers of in calf rates
- 80 day submission rate
- Conception rate

How do we improve calving KPIs
?
Growing heifers well
Maintaining body condition and providing adequate nutrition
Sound heat detection practices
Good AI technique
"Bull power" and bull management
Minimising cow health problems at calving and in early lactation (transition cow management)
Genetics (fertility)

What is the Australia Dairy Herd Improvement Scheme (ADHIS)
?
Australian Database of herd test results and conformational data
Australian Breed Values (ABVs)
- Calculated bi-annually (Feb/August)
- Numerous traits
  - Milk (L)
  - Protein (kg)
  - Fat (kg)
  - Cell count
  - Fertility
  - Teat position

What is genomics
?
Sequencing of bulls and cows < 1-year-old
Collection of tail hair samples (from birth)
genomic sequencing to determine ABV(g)s
Increases reliability for young animals especially for traits such as fertility and longevity
- The equivalent of 25-30 milk daughters for bulls
- Or 7 lactation for cows

What are the recommendations from ADHIS?
?
Use the highest BPI bulls you can afford (15-45/straw)
Use progeny test semen on some of the herd (decrease costs)
Keep good records to reduce inbreeding
Breed enough replacement to enable older cows to be culled
Select a range of sires rather than only one or two


Why would a lower average “Days In Milk” (DIM) be a driver of profitability?
?
If a year-round herd has a lower average DIM value, it means that more cows are being milked in peak lactation, less are getting in calf late and there will be a higher lifetime milk production per cow.
