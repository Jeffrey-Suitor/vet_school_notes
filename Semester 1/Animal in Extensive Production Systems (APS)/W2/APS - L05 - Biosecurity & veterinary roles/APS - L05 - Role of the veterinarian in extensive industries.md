# Role of the veterinarian in extensive industries

Many people don’t consider the wide diversity of roles for veterinarians beyond the traditional role as seen in books such as “All creatures great and small”.  This includes people both outside and also within the veterinary profession.

## 2.4.1  "Fire brigade" medicine

If you have ever read James Herriot, you will have in your head a good picture of “fire brigade” medicine.  Something goes wrong on a property and the vet is called out to help with the problem.  This is still a large part of veterinary practice however if you continue to do the same thing you will keep getting the same result  (rushing out to a property to solve a problem) - it is unrealistic to expect any reduction in the occurrence of the problem.  In large animal medicine the sorts of things you might typically do here is help an animal during or soon after the birthing process, investigate/diagnose/treat an issue with an ill animal, post mortem an animal to find cause of death and likely impact on rest of herd/flock etc.

## 2.4.2 Preventive medicine

In addition to racing out to farms to provide emergency relief for livestock, veterinary scientists can play a very important role on farms in preventing diseases or management problems.  So, rather than going to a property at 2am in the morning in cold, rainy weather to calve a cow, a different way to approaching this problem is to look at the animal genetics or genomics along with physical characteristics combined with nutrition to reduce dystocia via management, rather than pulling calves. This can be applied to many management decisions on farm from reproduction, infection management, biosecurity, nutrition etc.  This preventive medicine can dramatically change the role of the veterinarian from mostly emergency management to mostly preventive management.  The goal of this is to reduce the emergency call outs dramatically but spend similar time on property planning to optimise production and profit for the enterprise.  This overall improves animal welfare and financial outcomes when done well.  A number of veterinary practices are now doing a greater percentage of this kind of preventive work.

## 2.4.3 Not directly farm facing roles

There are a huge diversity of roles for veterinary scientists across a range of industries, many of which are associated with extensive enterprises.

### 2.4.3.1 Research roles funded by RDCs and other organisations

A large number of veterinarians are employed either directly by RDCs or more commonly by other organisations such as universities to do research on animal health and production.  This research is then extended to the livestock farming community to improve animal production and welfare. There are a range or research projects funded by Research and Development Corporations both in Australia and internationally.  . 

### 2.4.3.2 Animal health companies

Veterinary scientists are employed by animal health companies across a range of roles, particularly in technical areas.  They may also be involved in regulatory roles, marketing roles and general management.  Other roles may also be in animal feed related companies.

### 2.4.3.2 Government and regulatory

A huge range of veterinary roles exist within the government space.  This includes at regional level (district veterinary officer), state level (range of roles across range of different policy areas), national level (eg. CVO, AHA), International (FAO, OIE, WHO etc). In addition veterinary roles exist in the regulatory space in groups such as the APVMA, FDA and other similar bodies who regulate veterinary medicines.  Veterinarians also play a very important role in abattoirs assessing meat carcass quality and monitoring for signs of disease, particularly in export based abattoirs.

### 2.4.3.3 Involvement with agriculture organisations

A number of veterinarians have held roles within state or national farming bodies.  Eg. Dr Kat Ferme was the CEO of Sheep Producers Australia in the mid 2010s. 

### 2.4.3.4 Other

There are a huge range of roles that veterinary scientists can do that are related to extensive livestock production systems.  Those listed are the majority of areas where roles may be found or well-known roles but there is a much broader list than the list above. 

## 2.4.4 Managing agricultural enterprises

A number of veterinary scientists move from working as a veterinarian to working as livestock manager either on their own properties on managing other properties.  One example of this is the company “Growth Farms” along with a range of other superannuation investments in agricultural enterprises.  Veterinary science training provides a range of expertise which combined with further postgraduate training opens doors to many different options.
