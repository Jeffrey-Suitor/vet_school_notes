Who coordinates veterinary biosecurity in Australia::Animal Health Australia (AHA)

Who looks out for biosecurity::we all should

Who has commonwealth oversight of biosecurity::AHA

Who has state level oversight of biosecurity::Department of Primary Industry

Who has regional/local level oversight::often veterinarians employed by DPI which forms a regional defence against exotic disease incursion

Why is early identification important::Can save huge amounts of money and improve the prospect of eradication

What is an exotic disease and give an example for Australia::Disease not present in a country, foot and mouth disease

What is an endemic disease and give an example for Australia::Already present in the country, Mycobacterium paratuberculosis (Johne's disease)

What is the effect if an exotic disease were to enter the country::could potentially stop exports to many countries immediately

T/F Australia is primarily an exporter of animal products::True

What is the estimated cost of FMD::7 billion for a small outbreak, 14 billion for a large one

What animals are an excellent amplifier of foot and mouth disease and what must we not feed them::pigs and we don't feed them swill

What is bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)
?
Mad cow disease
Huge impact on countries where it has been identified
Australia has ongoing BSE monitoring
USA lost 11 billion in exports due to cases in the 2000s

Describe multi resistant parasites
?
Many farms have parasites resistant to most of the available chemicals to control parasites
Requires both chemical and non-chemical control options to extend life of current chemical options (integrated parasite management)
Need effective biosecurity to avoid purchasing stock with resistant parasites to spread to other sheep on farm

What are some practical forms of biosecurity
?
Having separate footwear for on and off farm, washing protocol
Machinery that goes on a farm should be washed down if transferred between farms
Livestock import protocol: assessment off-farm, testing, assessment on-farm, treatment, quarantine, reassessment
Regional biosecurity

Describe some basic biosecurity principals for veterinarians
?
Veterinarians pose a significant biosecurity risk as they go between enterprises
Consider biosecurity when visiting enterprises, particularly EMS
Vets work across a range of biosecurity areas - direct farm visits, local DPI, regional, state or commonwealth veterinary roles or OIE (WOAH) in research/extension

## Role Of The Veterinarian In Extensive Industries

What is fire brigade medicine::something goes wrong and you rush out to solve the problem, maybe do a postmortem

What is preventative medicine::Using science and medicine to prevent fire brigade medicine and have better control over an enterprise

What are some non farm facing roles veterinarians can be involved in
?
Research funded by RDC's and other organizations
Animal health companies such as regulatory roles, marketing roles, and general management
Government or regulatory roles as a veterinary officer, in abattoirs, etc.
Involvement in agriculture organizations
Veterinarians managing agricultural enterprises
