# APS - L4 - Profitability and Productivity

## Intended Learning Outcomes
- Overview of how profitability and productivity are measures and why it is important
- Size of livestock industry and relative importance of export to different markets

## Measuring Profitability and productivity
What is productivity::Output per animal per area

What is profit::amount of money left after all other business expenses are paid and income accounted over a given period

How can more productivity not be more profit::Less money per unit as eventually excessive costs can reduce profit even with larger production

What is the shape of the input/output curve::Inverse quadratic

How many months ahead does business cash flow for an enterprise go::12 months

What are some important aspects of a cash flow budget::current funds, incoming funds, upcoming costs, profit, 

When does the financial year range::July to June

How often do we general reconcile cash flow budget with bank statements::monthly basis or more often

What is the livestock schedule
?
Allows us to work out total value change in an enterprise 
For a livestock enterprise we need to know the change in value of livestock on the enterprise
Animals entering the business = purchases plus births (natural increase)
Animals exiting the business = sales plus deaths plus rations (eaten on farm)
Livestock are generally counted periodically throughout the year to provide information for these figures along with sales documents
Opening and closing values are usually different as the value of the animals may have changed.
Can be combined with cash flow to better understand business performance

What does EBIT mean::earnings before interest and tax

What are some other cost centres for an enterprise::depreciation (particularly machinery/infrastructure)

How can we compare finances across enterprises
?
gross margins
income attributable to a farm minus the variable (changeable) costs associated with it
Variable costs are those that very with the size of the enterprise, 100 cows + 20 cows means 20% more vaccines
A fixed cost is one that doesn't change depending on the number of cows. Cattle yards for only a small increase
Can be gross margin per hector per dry sheep equivalent
Doesn't equate to profit as it doesn't include fixed or overhead costs such as labour, depreciation, interest and rates

## Comparing Enterprises

What does gross margin fail to account for::Fixed costs, as it only measures variable costs such as dairy infrastructure being more expensive

What is the name of industry standard benchmarks::Farm monitor projects compare similar enterprises

Why is important to compare year to year on farms::Because the timing has a great affect on the return on total assets

What are some of the inputs associated with labour
?
Labour constant throughout the year
Contract labour is when people come on the farm to do specific work for a short period of time (shearing, etc.)
Owner/manager still needs to draw a salary/wage from enterprise
Labour often expressed as FTE (full time equivalent)
Quite variable depending on the enterprise type, a self replacing enterprise is likely to have a higher FTE/DSE than a fattening enterprise as animals are handled less frequently
A figure of 10000 DSE/FTE is a reasonable benchmark for a low input system

What does TPML mean: total plant machinery and labour

Describe the feed input
?
Highly significant for intensive industries
Variable impact on extensive industries from property type and pasture conditions
Cost of feed varies significantly on environment (drought makes it expensive)
Dairies commonly use some amount of supplementary feed to cows in bail
Different farms have wide variation in range of inputs varying on environment, topography, enterprise type, market

Describe the interaction of different systems
?
Most enterprises have more than 1 enterprise (cropping, sheep, and beef)
Less common for dairy farms to have more than one enterprise. They do supply some beef animals and do grown their own feed
Very common integration of sheep + wheat (grain) includes barley, canola
Utilises summer stubble (crop residue after grain harvest) and may also allow winter grazing up to certain crop stages

Describe grain and graze
?
Some cereal crops well suited to grazing in winter
Fodder for stock during feed limiting time during winter and also provide feed over dry summer when feed quality is low
Pasture phase on farms helps return some nitrogen to soil and reduces selection pressure on weeds

Describe grazing management
?
Goats are used to reduce weed burden as they will eat shrubby weed when either livestock may not
Beef cattle also used on equine enterprises to graze evenly as horse pastures often end up being dominated by weeds

Describe parasite management
?
One key benefit of mixed grazing can be in controlling parasites
Many roundworm species are specific to a particular host, cattle or sheep
If half of an enterprise is cattle and the other half is sheep they can swap grazing areas to reduce parasite pickup reducing need for extra drenching
Can prepare safer paddocks for young stock by grazing other livestock (not 100% as some parasites are shared)
