Decreases in calibre compared to the caecum
Largely to the left of the median plane
Divided into:
- Ascending

- Descending

Outline the shape of the ascending colon of the pig
?
Coiled to form a cone-shaped mass
- Base is dorsal
- Apex is ventral
centripetal turns (external: 2-3 coils
  - 2 taenia and 2 haustra
Centrifugal turns (internal)
- Calibre greatly reduced 
- No taenia or haustra

Describe the structure of the horse large intestine
?
Greatly enlarged cf. small intestine
- Hindgut fermenter
External longitudinal bands - taenia
Sacculations - haustra
- Chambers for bacterial fermentation
Large (great) colon = ascending + transverse colon
Small colon = descending colon

Outline the structure of the caecum
?
Comma shaped
Right iliac sublumbar region sweeping to the ventral abdominal floor (caudal to xiphoid)
Divided into
- Base

- Apex

Outline the location of the base of the horse caecum
?

REWATCH THE VIDEO HE HAS BECAUSE THAT SHIT IS COMPLEX

Describe the process of rectal examination in a horse
?
Colic: syndrome of abdominal pain
Common sites for impaction:
- Base of caecum
- Pelvic flexure
- The terminal end of RDC (can't reach)
- Small colon

Describe the blood supply of the horse intestine
?
Cranial mesenteric for the majority
The small colon is supplied by the caudal mesenteric artery
Linear branches of the ascending colon mean that if supply is compromised there is clinical issues

Describe a large colon volvulus in the horse
?
Twist of right ventral and dorsal colons
Causes compression to the blood supply
Occlusion of the lumen causing gas build-up --> Expansion of the discus
Ischemia of the organ

Describe the large colon displacement in the horse
?
Pelvic flexure moves cranially
Crosses the midline and then moves caudally
Crosses the midline again
Unlikely to interrupt blood supply and while it does require surgical correction it is not as dire
as large colon volvulus
Does lead to gas build-up
