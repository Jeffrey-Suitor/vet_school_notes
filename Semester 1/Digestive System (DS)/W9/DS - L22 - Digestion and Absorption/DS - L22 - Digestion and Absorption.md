## Digestion and Absorption

What is the main aspects of the histology of small and large intestines::increase length and increase surface area

What are the 3 parts of the small intestine::duodenum, jejunum, ileum

What are the layers of the gut
?
Mucosa: epithelium, lamina propria, muscularis mucosa
Submucosa
Muscle layers
Serosa

Outline the histology of the duodenum
?
Villi are on the outside of the plica/fold
Brunner's glands are submucosal glands found only in the duodenum

Compare the jejunum and ileum to the duodenum
?
Villi longer
The density of goblet cells increases caudally
**No Brunner's glands**
Peyer's patches are present
- Aggregated lymphoid nodules in the submucosa
- Most obvious in the ileum

What are the cellular components of the mucosa?
?
**Epithelial cell layer**
On villi:
- Goblet cells: secrete mucous
- Columnar absorptive cells absorb
In crypts:
- Undifferentiated columnar lining cells
- Goblet cells
- **Paneth cells** (ruminants and horses)
**Lamina propria**
- Collagen/elastic fibres, lymphoid tissue, smooth muscle cells from muscularis mucosa
- **Contains intestinal mucosal glands**
  - **Crypts of Liberkuhn**
  - Open between the base of the villi
**Muscularis mucosa**

What are the crypt cell types:: columnar cells, paneth cells, stem cells (located deep) (differentiate into columnar cells and then into villus cells)

What are the roles of the villus and the crypt::crypt=secretion, villus=absorption

Where are intestinal mucosal glands found::In the base of the crypts

T/F Brunner's glands are found in the crypts::False, they are found deep

What is a lacteal::A lymphatic in a villus

Outline the role of Brunner's glands
?
Only found in the duodenum
Tubuloacinar glands
Mucus secretion or mixed serous/mucous (species variation)
Ducts penetrate muscularis mucosa
Ducts open into the base of intestinal mucosal glands
Connected to intestinal mucosal glands via a duct

Outline the structure of the large intestine
?
Caecum
Colon
Rectum Anal canal
Same mucosa layers

What is the histology of the large intestine
?
Longer, less coiled simple tubular intestinal glands with many goblet cells
No submucosal glands
No paneth cells

Describe the specialisations in digestive secretion
?
Digestive enzymes:
- Membrane-bound in columnar absorptive cells
- Paneth cells (ruminants and horses only) -> secrete peptidase and lysozyme
Mucus
- From goblet cells on villi
- From submucosal glands (Brunner's glands in duodenum)
- Submucosal glands (mucous in dogs and ruminants, serous (proteinaceous) in pigs and horses)
Chloride
- From columnar cells of crypts

Outline the goblet cells
?
Produce mucous
Interspersed between columnar absorptive cells on villus
Less numerous at tips of villi

What are the crypts of Leiberkuhn
?
Contain:
- Columnar cells: secrete chloride
- Paneth cells: secrete peptidases and lysozymes

Why does chloride secretion matter
?
Important for maintaining an ideal environment for enzymatic digestion, nutrient absorption and stool movement
Since fluid cannot be actively secreted into the gut, this process is dependent on an osmotic gradient, which is mainly created by chloride transport by the enterocyte
A pathological dysbalance between fluid secretion and absorption leads to obstruction or potentially fatal diarrhoea

How is chloride secretion achieved?
?
Chloride enters the cells via a basal Na/K/Cl symporter that is driven by Na/K/ATPase (in the opposite direction)
**Apical chloride channels** secrete Cl to the lumen (**CaCCs** and **CFTR**)
Calcium sensing cell surface **CaSR** receptors and enteric nerves modulate intracellular signalling pathways to modulate secretion
Cholera toxin increases intracellular cAMP -> Increased chloride secretion
E Coli enterotoxin leads to increased intracellular cGMP -> Increased chloride secretion

Outline the role of Paneth cells
?
At the base of mucosal glands
Pyramidal shape
Prominent eosinophilic granules
Antibacterial role:
- Peptidase
- Lysozyme
Ruminants and horses

What is the role of Duodenal Brunner's glands
?
In submucosa
empty into the base of Crypts
Secretions:
- Mucous in dogs and ruminants
- Serous in horses and pigs

What are the specialisation for absorption in the gut
?
Sheer length
Mucosal/submucosal folds - **plicae**
Finger-like projects of mucosa --> **villi**
Folding of apical cell membrane --> **microvilli** "brush border"

What is an enterocyte
?
Simple columnar epithelial cells - Most numerous
Absorptive cells
Prominent microvilli on apical border
Ovoid basal nucleus
Tight junctions between cells

Where does water reabsorption primarily occur::Duodenum and jejunum > ileum > colon

What is the efficiency of water reabsorption in the gut from most to least::Colon (90) > Ileum (75) > Duodenum and ileum (50)

Outline the absorptive role of the small intestine
?
Most absorption is from the duodenum and jejunum
Bile salts from the ileum
Can resect 50% of the length of jejunum but not ileum 
Ileal resection can lead to bile salt, fat-soluble vitamin deficiency and Vitamin B12 deficiency
Other than Iron, Calcium and vitamin D there is little regulation of the absorption

Outline sodium absorption
?
Passive absorption
Active absorption
- Na ATPase on basolateral border
- Co-transport with Glucose or amino acids (SLGT protein)
Oral rehydration therapy (ORT)
- The Na/glucose co-transport system is unaffected by some diarrhoea-causing organisms
- ORT solution must remain isotonic

Outline the passive mechanism of sodium absorption
?
Na/K ATPase - basal cell surface through the small intestine and large intestine. Numbers increased in the large intestine by aldosterone

Outline the active co-transport with glucose or amino acids
?
Co-transport for Na-glucose and Na-amino acid on the luminal surface
SLGT protein sodium linked glucose transport protein

Outline the control of sodium absorption
?
The activity of transporters is regulated by second messengers
The enteric nervous system, local enterogastrones and other hormones are important
Increase in cAMP, cGMP and intracellular Calcium all **INHIBIT** Na absorption
Intracellular calcium is increased by acetylcholine

Describe carbohydrate digestion and absorption
?
Luminal digestion of carbohydrates to disaccharides by amylase
Dietary CHO presented to brush border as disaccharides
**Disaccharidases** located in brush border (maltase, sucrase, lactase)
Co-transport of Na and glucose (driven by active transport of Na across the basolateral border)
Is facilitated diffusion of glucose (anaerobic component)

Describe protein digestion and absorption
?
Presented to intestinal epithelium as small peptides and amino acids
Peptidases located in the apical membrane (brush border)
Amino acids absorbed by secondary active transport (Na dependent)
Each amino acid has a specific carrier mechanism and many are Na-dependent transport systems in either basal or apical membrane

Describe fat digestion and absorption
?
Quite different to CHO and protein absorption
Bile salts emulsify fat droplets --> micelles
**Lipase** hydrolyses TG's to MG's and FFA's
MG's and FFA's leave micelle and diffuse across the brush border
Triglycerides are synthesised
Coated with lipoprotein --> water soluble chylomicron
Exocytosed from the basal cell surface to lymphatic lacteals
Micelles are water soluble and diffuse across the unstirred layer, increasing the concentration of fatty acids and glycerol at the apical membrane by 100/1000 fold

Describe folate and cobalamin (vitamin B12)
?
Specific folate carriers located in the mid-small intestine
Specific cobalamin carriers located in distal SI (ileum)
Requires binding to intrinsic factor that is secreted by parietal cells of the stomach
