# DS - L24 - Role of Microbes in Digestion

## Intended Learning Outcomes
- Compare the roles of microbes in the digestive function of different domestic animal species, and explain how disruption of the microbiome can result in disease. 
- Explain the role of microbes in the digestive processes of hindgut and foregut fermenting animals. 
- Discuss the relative advantages and disadvantages of microbial digestion in the foregut and hindgut.

What does the term microbes mean
?
Microscopic organisms
Bacteria protozoa (archaea, fungi, viruses)

What does the term microbiota mean
?
ecological community of microbes
The preferred term for microflora

What is the microbiome::Genetic makeup of a particular microbial population

Describe the microbiota within carnivores
?
Complex microbiota within the colon
Limited bacterial fermentation
- Dietary converted to VFAs
- Some vitamin synthesis
Promote the health of intestinal mucosa
- The proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells
- helps to prevent colonisation by harmful bacteria

Describe the key concepts of microbes in the role of digestion in herbivores
?
Extract energy from plant cell walls (structural carbohydrates)
Glucose locked up as **CELLULOSE**
- The polymer of B-D-glucose attached by B-1,4 linkages
- Forms insoluble fibres
Mammalian digestive enzymes cannot hydrolyse cellulose because we can't act on beta glycosidic linkages
Cellulose normally appears as sheets and forms fibre-like structures

Describe the process of fermentation
?
Breakdown of carbohydrates by microbes under anaerobic conditions
Breakdown products of sugars (hexoses) are volatile fatty acids (VFAs)
- Absorbed and converted to energy substrates by the host
Hexose -> Pyruvate -> (Propionate, Butyrate, Acetate) and CO2 and CH4 are byproducts

What are the foregut fermentors
?
Microbial fermentation prior to exposure to mammalian digestive enzymes 
Cow, sheep, camels, alpacas, kangaroos

Describe the physiology of ruminants
?
Continuous culture system for anaerobic bacteria (plus protozoa and fungi)
VFAs absorbed across the forestomach epithelium (Provide 60-80% of the energy needs of the animal)

Outline the rumen microbes
?
10^10 to 10^11 bacteria per gram content
- Mostly attached to fibres of food material
- About 30 important species identified
- Many species are unidentified (>300) because they are anaerobic
- 10^5 to 10^6 protozoa per gram, fungi

Outline the process of bacterial symbiosis
?
Bacteria produce substrates necessary for other processes
- Some bacteria digest cellulose but not protein and vice versa
- Cellulose: *Ruminococcus spp., Bacteroides spp*
- Starch and sugars: *Streptococcus, Lactobacillus*
- Protein *Bacteroides, Streptococcus*

Describe the rumen environment
?
pH of about 6.5: VFAs buffered by bicarbonate/phosphate in saliva
Low oxygen
Temperature (exothermic)
Osmotic pressure
Antibodies from saliva

Describe bacterial protein metabolism
?
Proteins converted to peptides by bacterial proteases: Used for energy or microbial protein
Also utilises non-protein nitrogen - ammonia, and urea (can be recycled in ruminants)
Most protein reaching the small intestine is microbial

Describe the ruminant hindgut
?
Colon and caecum also sustain significant microbial populations
VFA production and absorption
Further bacterial action undigested fibre (Very fibrous forage)

Describe non-ruminant foregut fermenters
?
Kangaroos
Not a true ruminant
Greatly expanded forestomach
Very little methane production

Outline hindgut fermenters
?
Access to feed/nutrients before microbes
- Good-quality proteins and sugars are digested first
- Similar to carnivores and omnivores
Mainly indigestible fibre acted on by bacteria
- Also other cabs not hydrolysed by mammalian enzymes
- Fructans, pectins, B-glucan, resistant starch
Not as efficient as digesting fibre in ruminants
- Digesta not held in GI tract for sufficient time

Describe bacteria in the equine stomach
?
Limited fermentation in the *saccus caecus*
10^8 to 10^9 bacteria per gram ingesta
Digestion of some starch and fructan carbohydrates to VFAs
- Large starchy meals gastric ulcers

Describe fermentation in the caecum and colon in the horse
?
The large volume of ingesta
A similar conversion of substrates to that of rumen microbes
10^20 bacteria per gram content
Cellulose: *Ruminococcus, Fibrobacter*
Starch and sugars: *Streptococcus, Lactobacillus*
Populations always changing
- Composition of diet
- Meals vs grazing

Outline hindgut fermentation in rabbits
?
Hindgut fermenters
Large caecum (40% of intestinal contents)
Some products of hindgut digestion will not be absorbed 
A specialised type of coprophagy - consumption of faeces
Caecotrophs
- Contain microbes, amino acids, VFAs, vitamins
- Mucous coating

Outline hindgut fermentation in guinea pigs
?
Also caecotrophic
Very large caecum (65% of GI contents)
Gut flora contains many similar types of bacteria to rabbit and horse

What is gut dysbiosis::Pathogenic microbes and pathobionts outweigh beneficial microbes, symbionts

Outline inflammatory bowel disease
?
Canine IBD associated with dysbiosis
Microbiome requires further study, unsure if dysbiosis is primary or secondary
Therapies for dysbiosis
Probiotic
- Formulation of live beneficial whole bacteria
- Various licensed products
Prebiotic
- The substrate that promotes the growth of beneficial bacteria
- Psyllium, pectin, beta-glucan

Describe ruminal acidosis
?
Excess dietary hydrolysable carbohydrate
*Streptococcus, and Lactobacillus ferment starch -> lactic acid
Acute form
- pH < 5.5 -> other bacteria die, acidic damage to rumen mucosa -> fluid movement into rumen -> dehydration
Subacute form
- Rumenitis, dysbiosis
- Decreased energy production and absorption
- reduced growth, illthrift

Outline carbohydrate overload in horses
?
Normally absorbed in the small intestine
Sucrose and fructose are absorbed early while starch is absorbed later
If more than **0.4% bodyweight reaches the hindgut**
Too much fermentable carbohydrate may cause bacterial overgrowth and toxin production
Fibre, **Fructans** at the base of caecum
This results in a decrease in pH causing acidosis

Outline the problem of fructan carbohydrates in horse
?
The storage form of carbohydrates in stems of grasses
polysaccharides of one glucose with many fructoses
Both B(2->1) and B(2->6) linkages
- Resistant to mammalian enzymes
- Susceptible to bacterial enzymes
Lush grass high in fructans (spring) can cause hindgut disturbances
*Streptococcus and Lactobacillus ferment starch or fructan carbohydrates to lactic acid -> Other bacteria die
Numbers increase 100-1000x in a few hours
pH drops, damage to caecal mucosa
- Bacterial toxins released into circulation
- Horses exquisitely sensitive to the effects of bacterial toxins

Outline how lipopolysaccharide (endotoxin) is dangerous to horses
?
The outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria
1. O-antigen (O-polysaccharide)
2. Core oligosaccharide
3. Lipid A
LPS (endotoxin) is highly antigenic and in circulation will cause a massive systemic inflammatory response

What is the consequence of endotoxemia in horses::Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)

Describe enteritis in guinea pigs
?
Hindgut microbiota disrupted by stress, illness - intestinal stasis
Secondary to antibiotic therapy
- Oral penicillin
- Overgrowth of *Clostridium*
- Potent toxins
- Diarrhoea and dysentery

Outline transformation
?
Process of transferring microbe-rich digestive contents from one individual to another
- rumen contents in cows
- Faeces or caecal contents in horses
Repopulate gut with healthy microbiota
