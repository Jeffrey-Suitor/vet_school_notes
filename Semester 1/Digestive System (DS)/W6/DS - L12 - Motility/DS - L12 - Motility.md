## Intended Learning Outcomes
- Explain the features of gastrointestinal smooth muscle that provide for its autonomous activity and describe the hierarchy of neural and hormonal pathways that control secretory and motor activity in the gastrointestinal tract. 
- Describe the contractile patterns characteristic of gastric motility and explain their purpose, and explain how the structural and functional properties of gastric smooth muscle permit changes in volume with minimal changes in intra-luminal pressure.

- Efferent neurones (excitatory and inhibitory)

T/F There are more nerve cells in the gut than in the spinal cord::True

What are the 3 types of receptors found in the gut wall and describe their functions
?
Chemoreceptors: sense pH, protein, and a fat level of luminal content
Mechanoreceptors: sense stretch, particulate matter
Osmoreceptors: sense osmolality

What are enterogastrones, where are they produced, how are they transported, what have they released in response to, and what modulates their release
?
Local gut hormones
Produced by enterochromaffin cells in the gut wall
Carried in the bloodstream to act in the same or other areas of gut
Released in response to local changes, particularly in the lumen (e.g. fat, pH)
Release modulated by intrinsic and extrinsic nerve pathways

T/F Standard EH staining is effective in visualising enterochromaffin cells::False, a particular silver stain is best

What role do the extrinsic nerves in the gut play, what controls them, and what can they influence
?
Nerves that originate outside the digestive tract and innervate digestive organs
Autonomic nervous system: Sympathetic and parasympathetic 
Influence motility (and secretion) by:
- The modifying activity of the intrinsic plexus
- Altering level of hormone secretion
- Direct effect on muscle (and glands)

Describe the nervous systems which supply the gut and the role they play
?
Parasympathetic nervous system "rest and digest" -> increases gut motility
Sympathetic nervous system "fight or flight" -> decreases gut motility

What parasympathetic nerve synapses in the nerve plexuses in the gut wall and what is the other name for the nerves it innervates::vagus nerve (CN 10) and it innervates the intrinsic nerves of the gut wall

What is the neurotransmitter of the parasympathetic and sympathetic neurotransmitters
?
Parasympathetic: Acetyle choline (Ach)
Sympathetic: noradrenaline

The nerves in what regions make up the sympathetic chain::nerves in thoracic and lumbar regions of the spinal cord

T/F The sacral region provides parasympathetic control of the lower regions of the gut (anus, rectum, etc.):: False, it provides sympathetic control

What are the motility requirements of the stomach?
?
Accommodation of meals without an increase in pressure
Mixing
Breaking up of food pieces

What are the 3 phases of gastric motility
?
1. Gastric filling
2. Gastric storage/Gastric mixing
3. Gastric emptying

How does the stomach accommodate for increased tension caused by volume expansion?
?
Plasticity of stomach muscle: length-tension relationship different from cardiac or skeletal muscle, due to the arrangement of smooth muscle fibres
Receptive relaxation of the stomach as it fills: a vago-vagal reflex (both the afferent and efferent signals travel into the vagus nerve)

Describe the process of propulsion in the stomach
?
Pacemaker activity initiated in the upper fundus
Waves of depolarisation sweep towards the pylorus

?
Thicker muscular layer
Responsible for mixing/grinding
Contraction of the pyloric sphincter (continuous with antral muscle) keeps closed
Retropulsion of particulate chyme to the fundus of the stomach
Liquid chyme passes to the duodenum

Outline the process of gastric emptying
?
Increased pyloric antral peristaltic contraction leads to increased gastric emptying
Duodenal gastric factors alter gastric emptiness (Particularly the chemical and physical properties of chyme)

What are the factors that affect the rate of gastric emptying
?
Stomach: stretch, fluidity of chime -> increase the rate of emptying
Duodenum: fat, acid, hypertonicity, distension -> decrease the rate of emptying

How is the rate of gastric emptying controlled
?
Receptors: for pH, fat, osmolality, stretch
Hormones (enterogastrones): 
- Gastrin (G cells of pyloric antrum and duodenum)
- Secretin (duodenum)
- Cholecystokinin (duodenum)
- Gastric inhibitory peptide (duodenum)
Nerve pathways (intrinsic nerves)
Nerves pathways (extrinsic nerves)
- Sympathetic -> decreased emptying
- Parasympathetic -> increased emptying

Which stimuli cause the release of gastrin
?
Distension of stomach
Presence of protein or amino acids in the pyloric region of the stomach

What are the motility forms in the small and large intestines?
?
Segmentation (back and forward): responsible for mixing of chyme and increased contact with the absorptive surface
Migrating motor complexes (MMC): peristaltic waves that propel food down the GI tract
