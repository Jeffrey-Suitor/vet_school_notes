# DS - L15 - Intestines of the Dog and Cat

## Intended Learning Outcomes
- Describe the gross anatomy of the small and large intestines of the dog and cat, including their course and position in the body and relationships to other organs.

- Describe the gross anatomy of the pancreas of the dog and cat.

## Intestines of the Dog and Cat

T/F The intestines comprise the longest portion of the alimentary canal::True

Provide an overview of the location of the intestines
?
Commence at the pylorus
Extend to the anus
Divided into:
- Proximal part: small intestine
- Junction: caecum
- Distal part: large intestine

What are the 3 parts of the small intestine?
?
duodenum: the u-shaped portion that runs behind the mesentery
jejunum: longest and most convoluted segment that is suspended by the great mesentery
ileum

Where does the small intestine terminate::ileocolic orifice

Provide an overview of the duodenum and its anatomy
?
Close to the dorsal body wall
U shaped:
- Cranial flexure
- Descending duodenum
- Caudal flexure
- Ascending duodenum

What are the 3 important peritoneal connections in the duodenum?
?
mesoduodenum: between the duodenum and the dorsal body wall
hepatoduodenal ligament: extension of the lesser omentum, carries the common bile duct inside it
duodenocolic fold: Attachment between the ascending duodenum and the descending colon

In what ligament is the common bile duct carried::hepatoduodenal ligament

What are the key internal surface features of the duodenum
?
Pyloric opening
Major duodenal papilla: where the common bile duct and pancreatic duct insert
Minor duodenal papilla: where the accessory pancreatic duct inserts
Mucosal folds covered in numerous microscopic villi
Brunner's glands: mucus

Which duodenal papilla occurs first in the major or minor::major

Describe the gross anatomy of the pancreas
?
An exocrine organ that produces enzymes and bicarbonate
The body of the pancreas (the angle) is where the left and right lobes join together
Two lobes (V-shape, unite caudomedial to pylorus)
- Left lobe: shorter and thicker
  - Associated with the caudal surface of the stomach; within the greater omentum
- Right lobe: long and slender
  - Runs within the mesoduodenum
Externally it will appear yellow-pink in colour
Coarsely lobulated and forms a nodular surface

Describe the location of the pancreatic and accessory pancreatic ducts in the dog
?
Pancreatic duct
- Drains ventral primordium (right lobe)
- Opens on major duodenal papilla (in conjunction with bile duct)
Accessory Pancreatic Duct
- Drains dorsal primordium (left lobe)
- Open on minor duodenal papilla (3-5cm distal of the major duct)

How does the pancreatic anatomy in the cat differ from the dog
?
Smaller: 10 cm long and total small intestine length of 1-1.2m
1 duodenal papilla
1 pancreatic duct

Describe the structure of the jejunum and ileum
?
Forms the bulk of the small intestine
Occupies the ventral part of the abdomen - between the stomach and bladder
Maybe exteriorised
Jejunum forms the most convoluted part of the small intestine and has a long mesentery (great mesentery)
Ileum:
- Straight and usually contracted (firmer)
- Additional (antimesenteric) blood vessel and ileocaecal fold
- Ends at the ileocolic junction

T/F the jejunum and ileum may be exteriorised during surgery::True

T/F the duodenum is the site of the majority of abdominal absorption::False, the ileum is the site of the majority of abdominal absorption

T/F the jejunum contains antimesenteric blood vessels::False, the ileum contains the antimesenteric blood vessel

What is the great mesentery and what is its role and location
?
Great mesentery (long mesentery) is a layer of the peritoneum with two layers
Vessels and nerves between the layers
Gathered at its root at the origin of the cranial mesenteric artery
Intestinal mass covered ventrally by the greater omentum

What structure prevents the duodenum from being exteriorised during surgery::the mesoduodenum

What is the most ventral structure within the abdomen::greater omentum

Describe the internal features of the jejunum and ileum
?
Velvety appearance: this is due to the presence of villi which act to increase the surface area
Longitudinal and spiral folds: which also act to increase the surface area and increase the luminal volume
Peyer's patches: lymphoid aggregates, most often found in the distal jejunum and ileum

What features act to increase the surface area in the small intestine
?
Gross folds
Villi
Microvilli: "Brush borders"

What are the four segments of the large intestine
?
Caecum
Colon
Rectum
Anal canal

Describe the structure of the caecum
?
Located in the right dorsal region of the abdominal cavity
Ileocaecal fold: peritoneal fold connects the ileum and the caecum
Blind ending (spiral-shaped in dogs)
Opens into ascending colon via the caecocolic orifice
Guarded by muscular ring caecocolic sphincter

Where is the caecum located on the dog::right dorsal region of the abdominal cavity

What are the 3 parts of the colon and 2 sections of connecting peritoneum?
?
Ascending colon
Transverse colon
Descending colon
Connecting peritoneum:
- Mesocolon: holds the colon to the dorsal body wall
- Duodenocolic fold

What blood vessels supply the colon
?
8 -> celiac artery
9 -> cranial mesenteric artery
9' -> caudal mesenteric artery

What are the 4 blood vessels which supply the intestines
?
Celiac artery: hepatic branch to the proximal duodenum
Cranial mesenteric artery: small intestine, caecum and most of the colon
Caudal mesenteric artery: descending colon, cranial rectum
Internal pudendal artery: caudal rectum and anus

What are the names of the aortic artery which supply the stomach
?
1: Aorta
2: Celiac artery
4: Hepatic artery
7: Gastroduodenal artery
9 Cranial pancreaticoduodenal artery

All veins of the intestinal tract are tributaries to what structure::portal vein

Describe lymphatic drainage of the small intestine
?
Particularly in small intestines
Fat absorbed as chylomicrons will be included in the lymphatic drainage and will give a creamy or milky appearance referred to as chyle
Lymphatic vessels in the mesentery
- Flow to mesenteric lymph nodes at the root of the mesentery
- Lymph then enters the cisterna chyli - the origin of the thoracic duct

Describe the parasympathetic nerve supply to the intestines
?
Increases motility and secretions
Vagus nerve
- Long nerve from the neck
- Branches pass through the ganglia in the dorsal abdomen and synapse in the wall of the intestine
  - Myenteric (Auerbach's) plexus and muscularis externa
Pelvic nerves (to the rectum and distal colon)

Describe the sympathetic nerve supply to the intestine
?
Decrease motility and secretions
Splanchnic nerves (Splachna - viscera)
Originate from the thoracolumbar spinal cord
Synapse at ganglia in dorsal abdomen: celiac, cranial mesenteric, caudal mesenteric

Describe the structure of the rectum
?
Pelvic inlet to the anal canal
Most dorsal of the pelvic viscera
Suspended by the mesorectum
The terminal end is retroperitoneal

Describe the structure internal and external of the anal canal
?
Very short - connect rectum to the exterior
External surface covered by skin
- Thin
- Hairless
- Contains numerous circumanal glands
  - Sebaceous glands
  - Sweat glands
Recto-anal junction: where the lumen narrows
Mucosa thrown into longitudinal folds
Two sphincters:
- Internal anal sphincter: smooth muscle
- External anal sphincter: skeletal muscle

T/F the external anal sphincter is smooth muscle::False, it is skeletal muscle

Outline the structure and function of the anal sacs
?
Two large sacs ventrolateral to the anus
Between the internal and external anal sphincters
The single duct from each sac
Glands line the walls of the sacs

How can impacted anal glands be expressed:gentle squeezing
