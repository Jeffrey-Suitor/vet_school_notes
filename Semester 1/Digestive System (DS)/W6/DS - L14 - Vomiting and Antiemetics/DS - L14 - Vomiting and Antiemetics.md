# DS - L14 - Vomiting and Antiemetics

## Intended Learning Outcomes
- Describe the sequence of events in the vomiting reflex, the nerve pathways, neurotransmitters and receptors involved in the vomiting reflex.
- Explain how vomiting differs from regurgitation.
- Describe the mechanism of action of classes of peripherally acting and centrally acting emetics, in particular, dopamine antagonists, neurokinin-1 antagonists and 5HT3 antagonists, antihistamines, phenothiazines and anticholinergics and explain how an understanding of their mechanism of action and the cause of vomiting can assist in rational selection of an appropriate anti-emetic.

## Vomiting

What is vomiting
?
A complex reflex event, coordinated by the vomiting centre in the brain stem (medulla)
Is not reverse peristalsis; the stomach, oesophagus, gastro-esophageal sphincter and pyloric sphincter are all relaxed
Not all animals can vomit: dogs and cats vomit readily

Where coordinates the vomiting reflex::medulla oblongata

Why is vomiting not reverse peristalsis::the stomach, oesophagus, gastro-esophageal sphincter and pyloric sphincter are all relaxed

What are the elements of the vomiting reflex
?
Stimuli: Multiple
Receptors: chemo, stretch in multiple organs
Afferent neurones
An integrating centre (in the hindbrain)
Efferent neurones (of both the somatic and autonomic nervous systems)
Effectors: skeletal muscles, salivary glands and gastrointestinal tract

What are some of the stimuli for vomiting
?
Unpleasant smells
Unpleasant sigh
Abnormal motion
Intense pain
Tactile stimulation to the back of the throat
Distension of the stomach or intestine
Toxins
GIT irritation

How does vomiting occur
?
Stimuli from the cortex interact with the brain stem
Stimuli from the semi-circular canals can interact with the brain stem (in motion sickness)
Toxins from kidneys can interact with brain stem
The chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) can interact with the brain stem: Blood-brain barrier more permeable than other parts of the brain
The stomach interacts with the brain stem
The brain stem (medulla oblongata) causes vomiting

What are the mechanics of vomiting
?
Preceded by salivation, increased HR, pallor
Deep inspiration and closure of the glottis
Contraction of the diaphragm and abdominal muscles: increase intra abdominal pressure
Relaxation of sphincters and stomach
Gastric contents forced into the oesophagus
Increased pressure leads to relaxation of the pharyngo-oesophageal sphincter
Passage of vomitus to mouth

How is regurgitation different from vomiting
?
Regurgitation involves a reverse peristaltic wave in the oesophagus
generally occurs shortly after eating
undigested or poorly digested material
Not preceded by salivation, increased HR

## Antiemetics

What is the neurotransmitter released by the semi-circular canals that are used in the emesis response::histamine

What are the neurotransmitters which the cortex uses to supply the vomiting center::acetylcholine

What are the neurotransmitters present in the vomiting center::acetylcholine, neurokinin 1, $5HT_3$

What neurotransmitters are present in the CTZ::dopamine, $5HT_3$, neurokinin 1

What neurotransmitters are important in the periphery for the emesis response::dopamine, 5HT, neurokinin 1, acetylcholine

Why give anti emetics
?
Vomiting is a sign of disease - not a disease, administering an antiemetic does not affect a cure
Always important that the underlying disease is identified and addressed
Vomiting may be associated with:
- Nausea
- Distress
- Fluid loss and sometimes exhaustion

What is a class of drugs::group of drugs that shares a common mechanism of action

What are the antiemetics that target particular receptors?
?
Antihistamines
phenothiazines
Dopamine receptor antagonists
$5HT_3$ receptor antagonists
Neurokinin 1 receptor antagonists
Anticholinergics

How are antihistamines used as an antiemetic and give a general and brand name?
?
Treatment of motion sickness (receptors in semi-circular canals)
A side effect of sedation
The sedation can sometimes be useful as part of alleviating the stimulus of vomiting
Promethazine is the generic
The brand name is "Phenergan"

How are phenothiazines used as an antiemetic and give a general and brand name?
?
dopamine antagonist @ CTZ,  ACh antagonist @vomiting center
Side effects: anti-muscarinic, extrapyramidal effects (tremor, incoordination) and sedation
Prochlorperazine is the generic
The brand name is "Stemetil"

How are neurokinin 1 receptor antagonists used as an antiemetic and give a general and brand name?
?
Target NK1 receptors in both CTZ and vomiting centre
Therefore effective treatment for vomiting with a wide range of causes
The generic name is maropitant
The brand name is "cerenia"

How are dopamine receptor antagonists used as an antiemetic and give a general and brand name?
?
Dopamine antagonism @CTZ
peripheral effects due to increased activity of ACh -> increased gastric emptying
This is very useful in situations of gastric irritation where gastric emptying is delayed, providing a continuing stimulus to vomiting
Side effects due to dopamine antagonism: motor effects (particularly metoclopramide)
The generic name is metoclopramide 
The brand name is domperidone

How are $5HT_3$ (serotonin) antagonists used as an antiemetic and give a general and brand name
?
Activity at CTZ and periphery
Nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy postoperatively
Ondansetron (three times daily)
Dolasetron (once daily)

How are anticholinergics used as an antiemetic and give a general and brand name?
?
Is often present in drug mixtures
Of limited value as an anti-emetic
Hyoscine is a generic name

## Drugs for Intestinal Motility

What is the role of prokinetics in gut motility?
?
Normalise gastrointestinal motility to restore motility in the injured gut
The more complex mechanism of action involving other neurotransmitters in the ENS such as dopamine

T/F Dopamine antagonists are a class of prokinetics::True

T/F Cisapride is a prokinetic that increases the release of ACh in the myenteric plexus of gut::True

What are spasmolytics and what effect do they have on gastric motility
?
Bind to receptors and reduce gastrointestinal tone and motility
Used in colic or irritable bowel syndrome

Outline the parasympathetic blocking agents for spasmolytics. Include examples, a mechanism of action, and side effects
?
Hyoscine and atropine are examples
Block the action of the parasympathetic neurotransmitter acetylcholine at the receptor on smooth muscle
Significant side effects
- Affect secretion as well as motility
- Affect the parasympathetic function of other organs

What are is considered to be a more herbal form of modifying intestinal motility
?
Direct smooth muscle relaxants
Alverine, mebeverine, peppermint oil
More use in human medicine

What is the role of laxative drugs
?
Drugs used to treat constipation
Aims in treatment of constipation:
- To increase the bulk of large bowel content
- To increase water in the large bowel
- To increase propulsive contractions of the colon

What are the 4 forms of laxatives
?
Bulk laxatives (wheat bran) -> Not effect in ruminants or hindgut fermentors
Osmotic laxatives (lactulose, $MgSO_4$) -> Draw water into the large bowel
Faecal softeners (paraffin, docusate sodium (coloxyl)) -> Aids in the passage
Stimulant laxatives (senna) -> Must be with faecal softeners, osmotic laxatives, and increased water intake

What is the role of opioids in drugs for diarrhoea, include the name, usage period, and side effects
?
codeine, loperamide
Short-term use only
May have adverse (opioid) side effects and cause habituation
