What is the family giraffidae::Giraffes, weights from 250kg (okapi) to over 1500kg (giraffe)

What families are contained in the suborder Tylopoda and what are some example species
?
Family Camelidae: camels dromedaries, llamas, alpacas, vicunas

Explain why an animal would be adapted to ruminant
?
Ruminate means to chew over the food
This means they can better ferment food, which leads to high energy yield from low-energy food
The main aim of chewing over: reduce the particle size to increase the surface area of bacteria

What are the advantages of being a foregut fermentor?
?
Rumen provides safe space for bacteria: can break down cellulose links
Efficient conversion of low-quality feeds (dry grasses, thorn scrubs (giraffe))
Great tolerance for dry conditions: substantial water and salt conservations (recycling)
Can eat fast and remasticate later

What are the main disadvantages of being a foregut fermentor
?
Prolonged digestive processes
Low-energy food: require a large area of pasture
Complicated digestive processing (requires microbiota, partitioning of digesta, conservation of electrolytes and water)
A high-quality diet gets absorbed by bacteria (can't be utilised by a cow)

## Complex Stomach Anatomy

What are the functions of the forestomach?
?
1. Fermentation chamber (digestion by microbes): Absorption of volatile fatty acids
2. Mixing of ingesta
3. Separation of ingesta (selective cranial and caudal movement)
  1. Regurgitation of inadequately digested material (remastication)
  2. Eructation of gas (60L per hour)
4. Buffer rumen contents to maintain optimal pH while conversing electrolytes and water through recirculation

What are the 3 types of microbes that produce volatile fatty acids in the ruminant stomach?
?
(facultative) anaerobic bacteria -> 10 to 100 billion cells / g
Fungi
Protozoa (good markers for healthy rumen pH) 1 million cells / g

What is the function of the micro-organisms of the rumen stomach
?
Break down cellulose and hemicellulose into simple sugars that they digest -> produce volatile fatty acids (VFA) as waste product -> absorbed through rumen wall -> 60-80% of dietary energy for the cow
Continuous absorption is important to allow rumen pH to stay stable (volatile fatty **acids**)

T/F different forms of carbohydrates are broken down by the same species of bacteria::False, each carbohydrate is broken down by different bacterial species, and therefore you can't switch feed to fast

Describe the breakdown of carbohydrates in the rumen stomach
?
1. Complex sugar
2. Simple sugar
3. Hexose / Pentose
4. Pyruvate
  1. Byproduct: $CO_2$ -> $CH_4$ 
5. Acetyle-CoA or Lactate / Succinate
6. Acetyle CoA -> Butyrate / Acetate
7. Lactate / Succinate -> Propionate

What are the 3 volatile fatty acids which supply the ruminant stomach with energy::propionate, butyrate, acetate

Outline the process of volatile fatty acid absorption in ruminants
?
Rumen papillae increase surface allowing for increased absorption
VGA stimulate rumen papillae growth

What is the lining of the rumen composed of and what functions does it allow
?
Stratified squamous epithelium
Capable of absorbing VFAs, electrolytes and water
Can withstand the abrasive forces due to stratified nature

T/F glucose and other simple sugars provide the majority of the energy to the ruminant::False, simple sugars supply the bacteria with energy and the byproduct (volatile fatty acids) supplies the ruminant with energy

T/F the normal death of bacteria in the ruminant stomach can negatively impact the ruminants' health why are they have developed specialized complex stomach immune responses to capture these bacteria before their death::False, normal bacteria death is good for the ruminant as the bacteria combine nitrogen from urea/ammonium with parts of carbohydrates to produce all the essential amino acids so dead bacteria are a great source of amino acids and protein getting absorbed in the small intestine

What does the death of ruminant stomach bacteria provide to the ruminant::good quality protein and amino acids?

What is the consequence of rapidly introducing a high-grain (high-quality) diet to a ruminant?
?
Volatile fatty acid production will increase
The lactic acid presence will also increase
This leads to a decrease in rumen pH
If the rumen pH is lower than 5.7:
- cellulolytic bacteria die -> release of endotoxins
- epithelium damage
- epithelium damage allows the released endotoxins to enter the bloodstream
- Endotoxin presence in the bloodstream leads to shock and death

At what pH are there negative acidic effects on rumen pH::5.7

What are the consequences of having too low a pH in the ruminant stomach
?
cellulolytic bacteria die -> release endotoxins
epithelium becomes damaged

T/F Introducing a high-grain diet causes a rapid rise in pH leading to the death of cellulolytic bacteria and damage to the epithelium. This damaged epithelium allows endotoxins released by the death of the cellulolytic bacteria to enter the bloodstream leading to shock and death::False, it leads to a decrease in pH

T/F the rumen is better protected against low pH compared to the abomasum or monogastric stomach::False, the rumen is not as well protected

T/F the death of cellulolytic bacteria in the rumen weakens the epithelium and releases endotoxins::False, the low pH damages the epithelium, death of cellulolytic bacteria just released endotoxins


What happens in a gradual adjustment of the rumen diet to a higher grain diet
?
Lactic acid will increase but lactic acid-digesting bacteria will also increase
VFA production will increase and so too will VFA absorption

How many muscular layers are there in the stomach and what are their orientation::2 muscular layers (perpendicular)

## Rumen Orientation

What is the most cranial chamber of the compound stomach::reticulum

Where does the reticular groove lie and in what direction::center of the reticulum dorsal to ventral

What do the ruminoreticular fold seperate::reticulum and cranial rumen sac

What is the name of the separation between the cranial and ventral sacs of the rumen::cranial pillar
What separates the dorsal sac and the ventral sac in the rumen stomach::caudal pillar

Describe the primary contraction of the mixing process in the compound stomach
?
1. Double contraction of reticulum (1 min)
  A. Propels liquid contents into the cranial sac
  B. Propels fibre contents into the dorsal sac
2. Cranial sac and cranial pillar contract: directs flow into dorsal sac
3. Dorsal sac contracts: direct flow into the ventral sac (through raft)
4. Ventral sac contracts: directs flow forward over relaxed cranial pillar

T/F The double contraction of the reticulum propels the fibre contents into the cranial sac::False, it propels the liquid contents into the cranial sac

In a healthy cow often many times in 2 minutes would you expect the mixing cycle in the stomach to complete::3

Describe the secondary contraction (eructation)
?
Every 3rd or 5th contraction, more during feeding
1. Double contraction of reticulum
2. Cranial sac and cranial pillar contract
3. Dorsal sac contracts
4. Ventral sac contract: 
  A. Direct flow forward, cranial pillar remains contracted, redirecting the rumen content dorsally instead. 
  B. Gas cap tightens
5. Dorsal sac contracts a second time from caudal to cranial
  A. Moves gas in front of cardia
6. Cardia relaxes (if no fluid is present)
  A. Gas is sucked into the  oesophagus
  Retroperistaltic contractions move the  gas mouth
7. Ventral sac contracts again, cranial pillar relaxes and ingesta moves over the relaxed pillar
8. Gas gets inspirated to avoid burping sound

## Rumination

What are the 4 phases of rumination::regurgitation, remastication, resalivation, redeglutination

How is the process of rumination sense::reflex stimulated by mechanical receptors in the mucosa around the cardia (rumen and reticulum)

Where are the mechanoreceptors located in the rumen and what stimulates them::fibre detected by mechanoreceptors in the reticulum, rumino-reticular fold and cardia

Describe the process of rumination
?
1. Reticulum contraction with relaxed cardia: partially fermented fibres enter the oesophagus
2. Animal inspires against closed glottis -> negative intrathoracic pressure -> aspiration of fibres into distal oesophagus
3. Retroperistaltic contraction of distal oesophagus -> bolus moves towards mouth
4. In the mouth, the liquid is squeezed out and swallow
  A. Bolus is reinsalivated and remasticated
  B. It is swallowed after the  contraction cycle is finished
4. At the same time, the rumen undergoes primary contraction (or secondary contraction with eructation)

T/F cows burp::False when eructing they inspire to prevent burping

What are the 3 layers in the hierarchical regulation of the GIT
?
1. Autonomous activity
2. Local (intrinsic) reflexes
3. Extrinsic reflexes)
Rumen works similarly to the rest of the GIT but with some tweaks

Outline the process of intrinsic myogenic contractions
?
leaky membranes allow for inward Na movement
Muscle cell membrane action potential (variable threshold)
Tight gap junction (functional syncytium which allows the spread of depolarisation)

T/F cholinergic agonists and ganglionic blockers interfere with the myogenic pathway::False, neither interferes with the myogenic contraction

T/F cholinergic agonists will post the intrinsic neurogenic contraction::True

T/F ganglionicblockers will reduce the intrinsic neurogenic contraction::True

What are the two types of intrinsic contractions::myogenic, neurogenic

What are the 3 types of extrinsic contractions::local stimuli and reflexes, hormones, autonomic nervous system

Describe the structure of the salivary glands
?
Acini cells which produce mucous/serous content
Secretion flows down an intercalated duct
Secretion reaches a collecting duct

How does the autonomic nervous system impact the salivary action of the parotid and submandibular glands?
?
|                 | Parotid gland                        | Submandibular gland      |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| Parasympathetic | Secretory flow increases a lot       | Secretory flow increases |
| Parasympathetic | Protein composition remains the same | Minimal mucous content  |
| Sympathetic     | Protein composition increases        | Mucous content increases                         |

| Daily Output (sheep) 3-8 L                                            | Daily Output (sheep) 0.4-0.8 L                     |
| Reflex stimulation of flow from mouth, oesophagus, and reticulo-rumen | Reflex stimulation of flow from buccal region only |

What are the 4 functions of the parotid gland?
?
Recycle salt absorbed from the gut
Recycling water from the gut
Maintaining the pH (7.4) of the reticulo-rumen
Maintaining an optimal electrolyte concentration in the reituclo-rumen

How does the saliva impact the intake of water in an animal::The saliva effectively reduces the amount of water and electrolytes which have to be consumed by reusing them

## Young Ruminants

Describe the status of the gut when a ruminant is born
?
Born without adult rumen flora
Start eating a small amount of roughage with about 1-2 weeks
Develop adult rumen flora within the first 2-3 months
The gastric groove prevents the milk from reaching the forestomach

What is the gastric groove in ruminants
?
A reflex that shunts milk from the oesophagus to the omasum -> prevents it from entering the rumen where it would ferment (turn sour) and colostral antibodies may be destroyed
It delivers high-quality milk protein directly to the abomasum without 'losing' it to the developing rumen flora
Initiated by suckling action + presence of certain milk proteins/electrolytes

## Camelids

Describe the camelid stomach
?
3 chambres (omasum) equivalent is missing)
Chamber 1 and 2 - fermentation vats
- Unique saccules (invaginations) in ventral portion -> increased surface area -> absorption of VFA increased
- Ingesta is homogeneously mixed (no layers)
- Can spit regurgitated chamber material from chamber 1
Chamber 3 - last 1/3 is glandular and the rest is also for the fermentation

T/F Camelids have 3 chambers in their stomach::True

What presentation will cows with frothing in the stomach show::bloat because the froth prevents the gas cap from opening leading to a pressure build-up and potential death? Anti-frothing to cure but a trochar can be used to release pressure
