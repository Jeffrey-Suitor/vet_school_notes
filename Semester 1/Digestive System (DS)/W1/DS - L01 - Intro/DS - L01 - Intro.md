# DS - L1 - Intro
## Intended Learning Outcomes
* Describe the general design of the digestive system
* Identify the regions of the abdomen
* Describe the internal and external surface features of the abdomen
* Describe the structure and the function of the peritoneum

## Anatomy Overview

Anatomy is the study of::the body

Anatomy is a ___ and ___ discipline::visual and tactile

Surface anatomy is::the external features of an animals body without dissection

Gross  anatomy::can be viewed with naked eye and may involve dissection

Microscopic anatomy (Histology)::The study of tissues and examine the cellular level

## Equine Caecum

### Surface Anatomy
 A large blind ending sack that is part of large intestine of the horse where bacteria ferment the forage taken in.

Where is the equine caecum located:: In the right flank region of the abdomen

What would you listen for in the equine caecum and with what tool::Stethoscope to listen for the ileocaecal valve flush

Where is the ileocaecal valve located and how often does it flush::The ileocaecal valve is located between the distal small intestine (ileum) and the large intestine (caecum) and flushes every 60 to 90 seconds

Where do you place your stethoscope to listen to the ileocaecal valve::In the right paralumbar fossa region

### Gross Anatomy

What surgery do you perform for a horse that has colic::laparotomy

In surgery how do you know if the caecum is in the correct position::by understanding the relevant anatomy

How can you tell if a caecum is distended through rectal palpation::it will tight and distended with gas (can't press in, firm and non indent-able)

### Histology

What layer of the caecum contacts feed::mucosa

What is the name of the outermost layer of the caecum::mucosa

What do mucosa cells secrete and what is it's function::mucosa cells secrete mucus which acts as lubricant in the lumen of the small intestine

What is the most external layer of the caecum::muscularis externa

What is the muscularis externa in the caecum used for::controls contractility of the caecum and providing the motility to move the feed

How big is the equine caecum (volume)::20-30 litres

## Functions of the digestive system

What are the functions of the digestive system (5)::securing food, conducting+storing food, mechanical + chemical digestion, absorption of food, storage and disposal of waste

What is the difference between cow and dog teeth::dogs have teeth designed for ripping and tearing flesh where as cows have teeth designed for chewing feed

What is the difference between cow and dog stomachs::dogs have a simple stomach where acid and enzymatic of a largely proteinaceous diet where as cows have a compound stomach comprised of multiple chambers where fermentation of feed occurs to release energy

## Digestive Tract Regions

What are the 3 regions of the digestive tract::mouth, pharynx, alimentary canal

The alimentary canal includes the esophagus

What unique structure does the alimentary canal of birds contain and what is it used for::the crop, which is used to store food

What has a lower ph the stomach or the intestine::the stomach has a lower ph and the intestine which is used for absorption has a higher ph

### The Mouth

The mouth is supported by what 2 structures::The maxilla (upper jaw) and the mandible (lower jaw)

What structures border the mouth cavity::Above by the hard palate and below by the tongue and the other soft tissues and laterally by the dental arcades (the teeth)

What is the outer vestibule::This is the space between the lips, cheeks, and teeth

### Pharynx
What is the pharynx::Short funnel-shaped muscular tube and is where the respiratory and digestive systems cross over

Explain the crossing over of the digestive and respiratory systems in the pharynx::Air enters the nasal cavity and goes ventrally (down) to the trachea and food enters the mouth and moves dorsally (up) to get to oesophagus

### Alimentary Canal
What are the 4 regions of the alimentary canal::oesophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine (including rectum and anus)

What is and what does the oesophagus do::Long muscular tube that conducts food into the stomach

What happens in the stomach::The process of chemical digestion begins to occur

What happens in the small intestine and what features allows this::The process of digestion occurs and due to the large surface area that facilitates nutrient absorption

What happens in the large intestine::Water absorption occurs and the fermentation of fibrous forage in the relevant animals

What is the innermost layer of the alimentary canal and what does it do::the mucosa which transports nutrients and acts as a barrier

What is the second most innermost region of the alimentary canal::The submucosa which is a connective tissue layer containing blood vessels and nerves

What is the third most inner layer of the alimentary canal::Thick muscle layer responsible for the motility of the alimentary canal, mixing and peristaltic movements

What is the most external layer of the alimentary canal::An outer connective tissue layer that depending on alimentary canal region will either be serosa (small and smooth) or adventitia (blends in with other tissues like in cervical esophagus)

Describe an intrinsic glands in the alimentary canal::Intrinsic glands are located inside the alimentary canal and release secretions and enzymes and differs between species. This includes mucus and enzymes.

Describe extrinsic glands in the alimentary canal::Extrinsic glands deliver secretions to the lumen of the intestine via ducts. This includes salivary glands, liver, and pancreas.

Where do the salivary glands, liver, and pancreas release their respective secretions::In order, the oral cavity, duodenum via the bile duct for digestion of fats, releases digestive enzymes and bicarbonate secretions into the duodenum

## Abdomen

With the dog in a supine position (on it's back) viewing head on. Head is at the top.
* hypo - below, chondrial - ribs
* umbilical - near umbilicus
| R                   | Abdominal Labeling   | L                  |
| ------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------ |
| Right hypochondrial  | Xiphoid (epigastric) | Left hypochondrial |
| Right flank         | Umbilical            | Left flank         |
| Right inguinal      | Pubic                | Left inguinal                   |

What is cranial of the abdominal cavity::The diaphragm

What is dorsal of the abdominal cavity::Lumbar vertebrae, sub-lumber muscles, arms (crura) of the diaphragm

What is lateral of the abdominal cavity::the diaphragm, muscle layers, part of the pelvis

What are the names of the 3 muscle layers lateral of the abdominal cavity::internal oblique, external oblique, transverse abdominal

What two parts of the pelvis are lateral of the abdominal cavity::left and right ilium.

What is ventral of the abdominal cavity::The left and right rectus abdominis muscles

What is caudal of the abdominal cavity::The pelvic inlet

## Peritoneum

What is the peritoneal cavity::Abdominal cavity + pelvic canal enclosed in peritoneum

Which has a greater area the peritoneum or the skin::peritoneum

What are the 3 types of peritoneum::parietal, visceral, and connecting

What type of peritoneum lines the outer surface of the peritoneal cavity::parietal

What type of peritoneum lines the surface of the organs inside the peritoneal cavity::visceral (serosa)

What structure connects organs to organs or organs to an outer surface in the peritoneal cavity::Connecting peritoneum which is double layered

What is the function of the mesentery::To connect the intestinal tract to the dorsal body wall

Are the kidneys inside or outside the peritoneal cavity::outside (retroperitoneal)

What are the two types of omentum and where do they come from::lesser and greater curvature which is based on the lesser and greater curvature of the stomach

What is contained in the greater omentum::fat, blood vessels, lymphatics, as well as the relevant organs (small intestine, etc.)

What is the purpose, volume, method of return, and function of peritoneal fluid::to lubricate the contents of the peritoneal cavity, 1-2 ml in a dog, returned via lymphatics, and is important in immune function

What are some organs in the abdominal cavity and what is their physical location relative to one and other::Cranially to caudal -> liver, stomach, spleen, kidneys, intestines, bladder

What are the 6 F's of abdominal distension::fat, fluid, flatus (gas), faeces, foetus, fulminant mass
