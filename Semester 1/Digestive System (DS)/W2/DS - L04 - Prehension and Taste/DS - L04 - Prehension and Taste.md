# DS - L4 - Prehension and Taste

## Intended Learning Outcomes
- Describe the structure and structural relationships of the oral cavity and pharynx in mammals
- Describe the structure and actions of the lips, cheeks, tongue, palate, pharynx, and temporomandibular joints, their associated muscles and their innervation, and relate these to their functions
- Relate variations in oral and pharyngeal structure in different domestic species to functional requirements

## Oral Cavity Overview

What are the functions of the oral cavity
?
prehension (grasping) of food and drawing into the mouth
passage of food through to the pharynx
mastication (tearing, biting, chewing, grinding or crushing by the teeth)
Salivation of food for moistening or lubrication or initial breakdown of starches
taste
deglutition (swallowing)
aggression and defence
Part of the airway
Contribute to grooming and temperature regulation (panting for heat loss)

What are the boundaries of the oral cavity
?
rostrally: the lips
laterally: the cheeks
The vestibule is the space between lips and cheeks and teeth
ventrally: the floor of the oral cavity beneath the tongue
caudally: palatoglossal arch (between the soft palate and the root of the tongue)
dorsally: hard palate and soft palate

Describe the oral mucosa
?
Most superficial layer of the oral mucosa is the epithelium which consists of stratified squamous epithelium resting on a basement membrane.
In parts of the epithelium it may be keratinized (cornified), although this does not occur in more mobile areas such as the lips, cheeks, and floor of the oral cavity but is keratinized in areas such as the gums, hard palate, and dorsal aspect of the tongue
The next layer is the lamina propria which is a layer of connective tissue (there is no laminar muscularis in oral mucosa)
Submucosa is the next layer of the oral cavity and in some areas such as the lips, tongue palate and cheeks, contains minor salivary glands

T/F Keratinized cells have a nucleus and are filled with a keratin protein matrix::False, keratinized cells do have a keratin protein matrix but they do not have a nucleus

Why would a tissue become keratinized::For better resistance to mechanical forces

T/F All cells contain keratin::True, which is why cornified is the preferred term instead of keratinized

T/F There is a distinct margin between the lamina propria and the sub mucosa in the oral cavity::False, the boundary is not distinct due to the lack of laminar muscularis

T/F the salivary glands found in the submucosa are identical to the major salivary glands::False, the minor glands are distinct from the major salivary glands

What is the function of the submucosa::Connect the laminar propria to the muscle or bone

What type of muscle comprises the muscular tunic in the lips, cheeks, and soft palate::skeletal muscle in contrast to other regions of the digestive tract which are smooth muscle

In what species is the epithelium keratinized and in what species is it not
?
Keratinized: horses and ruminants
NOT keratinized: carnivores or pigs

The submucosa contains what type of glands::minor salivary glands called labial glands whose ducts open through the oral mucosa into the oral cavity

What is the name of the junction between the exterior of the lip and the mucosa on the interior of the lip::mucocutaneous junction

What are the names of the muscles that contribute to the movement of the lips
?
Orbicularis oris: completely surrounds the margin of the lips, closes the lips
Levator nasolabialis: acts to lift the upper lip and dilate the nostril
Levator labii superioris: deep to the levator nasolabialis, acts to lift the upper lib, may dilate nostril, contributes to the flehmen response which is used for pheromone sensing
Depressor labii inferioris: (not in dog and cat), depresses the lower lip
Caninus: lift the upper lip and potentially dilate nostril, contributes to the snarl in the dog (reveals it's upper incisors and upper canines)

What cranial nerve innervates the lip muscles and what is the alternate name::Cranial nerve 7 also called the facial nerve

How many cranial nerves are there and what generally are they::12 and they are nerves which originate from the brain and emerge through the skull to innervate structures in the head and elsewhere in the body. They have a variety of function including somatic sensation (pain, temperature, touch), motor activity, special sense (vision, taste, and hearing)

What is the role of the facial nerve in the head::motor to the muscles of facial expressions

Describe the species variation with regard to lips
?
In the ox lips are insensitive, thick, and lined with buccal papillae to help direct food
Many domestic species have a philtrum which is a cleft in the upper lip which divides it and is thought to allow for closer grazing
The extent of the lips in relation to the dental arcade varies with diet time and affects the gap of the mouth. Herbivores have a small gape and do not expose all their teeth while carnivores have a larger gape. This leads to differences in drinking with herbivores sucking up water where as carnivores use their tongue to lap water

What is the structure of the lip papillae in ox::conical pillars (cone shaped) which are pointed backwards to help direct food caudally

What is the purpose of the philtrum::To allow for closer grazing

Where is the philtrum located::Medially in the upper lip

Describe the structure of the cheeks
?
Vestibule: walls of the oral cavity caudal to the lips and with the lips
Buccinator: forms the muscular tunic, when contracted it returns food from the vestibule to the oral cavity proper, innervated by CN 7

T/F the layers of the mucosa of the vestibule are the same as the lips::True

What term describes the fibre arrangement in the buccinator muscle::herringbone arrangement 

What two cavities does the palate separate::oral and nasal

What are the two parts of the palate::hard palate rostrally and soft palate caudally

Describe the hard palate::bone covered by thick mucosa which forms ridges called rugae which are angled to guide food backwards, mucosal epithelium is keratinized and the submucosa is dense and closely attached to the periosteum.

What is the periosteum::Fibrous outer covering of the bone

What unique structure do ruminants have near the palate and where is it located::dental pad on the rostral part of the hard palate which comprises heavily keratinized mucosa and a thick layer of dense connective tissue

What are palatine glands::minor salivary glands present in all domestic species except pigs

What bones compose the hard palate::incisive, maxillary, palatine

Where is the soft palate located and what is its function::Caudal to the hard palate and comprises a dorsal and ventral mucosa layer. Within the mucosal layer is connective tissue (no salivary or palatine glands) and three paired muscles which shorten, tense, and raise the palate

What are the parts of the tongue::root, body, apex

Where is the root of the tongue attached::hyoid apparatus

T/F The body of the tongue is attached to the mandibles::True

T/F The apex of the tongue is attached to the hard mandibular tissue::False, the apex of the tongue is free

What is the name of the structure that attaches the tongue to the floor of the oral cavity::frenulum

## Hyoid Apparatus

What is the name of the single bone that connects the two sides of the hyoid apparatus::basihyoid

How does the hyoid bone attach to the skull::Dorsally, via the tympanohyoid cartilage

What does the hyoid suspends::The larynx inside the laryngeal cartilage, and the tongue which is attached to the basihyoid

What are the bones in the hyoid from top to bottom::Stylohyoid, epihyoid, ceratohyoid, basihyoid, thyrohyoid

Describe the structure of the mucosal epithelium of the tongue
?
Dorsal: thick, keratinized, bears numerous lingual papillae
Ventral: 
- nonkeratinized
- abundant capillaries and arteriovenous anastomosis for thermoregulation
- minor salivary glands in the submucosa called lingual glands
- serous gustatory glands that open into sulcus of the vallate papillae which secrete a watery material to help dissolve foodstuffs to help present those materials to the taste buds within the sulcus of the vallate papillae

## Papillae 

What is the function of the papillae on the dorsal aspect of the tongue::mechanical function to grip the food and help move food caudally to the pharynx and gustatory function as they bear taste buds

What is the function of filiform papillae::threadlike, short, point caudally, keratinized, cover most of the tongue surface and give grip to the tongue and assist with food movement, in horses they are relatively small and have a velvety feeling but can be larger and have a rougher surface, in cats they are modified 

What are cavo papillae::modified filiform papillae in cats that have a hollow spine and act to wick fluids which allows deposition of saliva deep in the fur, giving a thermoregulatory function as well as their grooming function

What is a canonical papillae::mechanical papillae larger than filiform and is present on the root of the tongue in dogs, cats, and pigs and on the taurus linguae in ruminants, and animals like the ox and camel inside the cheek and lips

What is a lentiform papillae::lens shaped, mechanical function, round to ovoid in shape and are present on the taurus linguae of the ox

What are fungiform papillae::mushroom shaped, scattered among filiform papillae, gustatory papillae as they bear taste buds but amount of taste buds varies between species

What are foliate papillae::leaf like parallel folds on the on the lateral margin of the root of the tongue rostral to the palatoglossal arches, gustatory but not found in ruminants and lack taste buds in cats

What are vallate papillae::large, broad, flattened papillae surrounding by a groove (sulcus) located at the junction of body of the tongue and the root of the tongue, gustatory, and the number of papillae varies between species

What are marginal papillae::Found on the margin of the rostral tongue in the newborn dog and pig, mechanical function, aid in suckling, and disappear when diet changes from liquid to solid

What are taste buds::clusters of specialized cells embedded in the epithelium of gustatory papillae. Have a small opening (taste pore) on the epithelial surface and their base is in contact with fibres of nerves, they convey the sense of taste to the brain from the tongue. Taste buds are also present in the soft palate, epiglottis, and other areas of the oral cavity and pharynx

What is the innervation for taste of the tongue::rostral two thirds of the tongue is carried by the facial nerve. In the caudal third of the tongue taste sensation is carried by the glossopharyngeal nerve which is CN 9.

What are some of the other species differences in the tongue aside from papillae
?
In the ruminant the tongue has a taurus which is an enlarged body, a raised thicken section of the body of the tongue. There is a lingual fossa rostral to the lingual taurus and is a potential location for the lodgment of foreign bodies in the tongue
Carnivores have a lyssa which is responsible for the median sulcus in the tongue which is quite prominent in dogs. The lyssa is a rod shaped fibrous body in the median plane beneath the ventral mucosa, consists of a sheet of connective tissue enclosing muscle, adipose, and a small amount of cartilage
In the horse tongue the lingual body contains lingual cartilage which is a median strip of cartilage beneath the mucosa of the tongue in the horse. 

Where are the cavo papillae (wicking) on a cat located and why::rostral part of the dorsum of the tongue which is the region of contact during grooming

## Muscles of the tongue

What muscles support the tongue but aren't directly attached
?
mylohyoideus: transversely oriented fibres, most ventral muscle between the pair mandibles, participates in swallowing
geniohyoideus: dorsal to the mylohyoideus, chin, paired strap of muscle extending from the chin to the basihyoid, draws the hyoid apparatus rostrally when it contracts

Is either of the mylohyoideus or geniohyoideus considered to be extrinsic muscles of the tongue::No, they are not directly attached so neither one is an extrinsic muscle of the tongue

Why is the tongue so mobile::Prehension, lapping of liquids, grooming, and manipulation of food

What is the orientation of the intrinsic muscles in the tongue::longitudinal, transverse, and vertical bundles, to allow the tongue to undertake complex local movement

What are extrinsic muscles of the tongue
?
muscles which originate on the hyoid apparatus to the tongue
originate exterior to the tongue and insert into the tongue
depress, protrude, or retract the tongue
styloglossus: originates from the stylohyoid bone to the tongue
hyoglossus: originates from base of the hyoid bone to the tongue
genioglossus: originates from the mandible and the genio (chin) and to the tongue

What innervates the extrinsic muscles and what innervates the intrinsic muscles of the tongue::Both are innervated by cranial nerve 12 which is the hypoglossal nerve.

What provides the motor innervation to tongue muscles::Cranial nerve 12 (hypoglossal)

What cranial nerve innervates the geniohyoideus muscle::Cranial nerve 12 (hypoglossal)

## Muscles of mastication

What is the name of the articulation between the mandible and the skull::temporomandibular joint

What are the three jaw closing muscles::temporalis, masseter, pterygoids

What is the jaw opening muscle::digastricus

Where does the temporalis muscle originate and insert and what does it do
?
Originates: extensive area of the lateral surface of the cranium on the frontal parietal, temporal, and occipital bones
Inserts: on the coranoid process at the proximal (dorsal) end of the ramus of the mandible
Does: Pulls the jaw upwards

T/F Carnivores have a larger temporalis muscle compared to herbivores::True

Where does the masseter originate, insert, and do
?
Originate: Maxillary region of the skull, zygomatic arch
Does: 
- raise the mandible or close the jaw
- move the mandible laterally when it is contracted on one side as the origin is lateral to the insertion
- protrude the lower jaw

T/F Carnivores have a greater lateral movement of the mandible than herbivores::False, herbivores have a greater lateral movement of the mandible

Where does the pterygoids structure, originate, insert, and do
?
structure: lateral and medical pterygoids
Originates: medial to the mandible, pterygopalatine region of the skull
Inserts: medial face of the mandible, opposite side of the mandible from the masseter
Does: close the jaw, move the lower jaw medially when contracted to one side, because the origin is medial to the insertion, protrude the lower jaw

Where does the digastricus originate, insert, and do
?
Originates: from the jugular process of the occipital bone, caudal to the temporomandibular joint, crossing the ventral aspect of the temporomandibular joint
Inserts: ventral aspect of the mandible
Does: Jaw opening muscle

What is the name of the division of the digastricus in dogs::tenderness intersection divides the muscle into two bellies that are rostral and caudal bellies

T/F The buccinator muscle is a muscle of mastication::False, the buccinator muscle is not a muscle of mastication

Why is there only one jaw opening muscle::Most of the work of chewing is done by closing the jaws

What muscles innervate digastricus
?
Rostral belly: Mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve (CN 5)
Caudal belly: Facial nerve (CN 7)

How does the digastricus muscle differ in the horse compared to the canine::There is an additional slip of muscle called the occipital mandibular part that inserts on the ventral aspect of the caudal mandible.

## Temporomandibular Joint

Between what does the temporomandibular joint articular::zygomatic process of the temporal bone and the condyloid bone of the mandible

What are the two compartments of the temporomandibular joint::dorsal and ventral

What divides the two compartments of the temporomandibular joint::intraarticular disc called a meniscus which is a fibrocartilaginous disc which allows complex movement at the joint

Why does the temporomandibular in herbivores have a flat surface::allows lateral to medial excursion of the mandible for grinding food between the cheek teeth, this action relies on coordination between the pterygoids the masseters on each side

What muscles are relatively large in herbivores::pterygoids and masseters to allow for horizontal movement of the jaw

What features do carnivores have around the temporomandibular joint::bony processes that restrict the joint movement to a hinge like action, as the emphasis is on vertical force to grasp and kill prey then to tear through flesh and bone.

What jaw muscle is largest in carnivores::temporal muscle

## Pharynx

What are the boundaries of the pharynx
?
Caudal: palatoglossal arches, fold of mucosa that extend from the soft palate to the body of the body of the tongue

What two systems does the pharynx belong to::digestive + respiratory

What are the three parts of the pharynx
?
oropharynx: ventral to soft palate, extends from palatoglossal arches to the base of the epiglottis, aligns with the caudal margin of the soft palate
nasopharynx: dorsal to the hard and soft palates, extends from the choanae (internal nostrils) to the intrapharyngeal ostium. 
laryngopharynx: dorsal to the larynx and extends from the intrapharyngeal ostium to the opening of the oesophagus, wider rostrally and narrows towards the entrance to the oesophagus, it's floor is largely occupied by the entrance to the larynx

What forms the intrapharyngeal ostium::palatopharyngeal arches which extend from the soft palate dorsally

What laryngeal cartilage is most rostral and what is it's function::epiglottis, works to divert fluids from the oral cavity and oral pharynx into the pyriform recesses that lie in the floor of the laryngopharynx on either side of the larynx

How does air pass through the pharynx::From the nasal cavity, through the nasopharynx into the larynx and down the trachea

How does food pass though the pharynx::Oral cavity, oropharynx, laryngopharynx, oesophagus

Describe the walls of pharynx::contain skeletal muscle that act to facilitate the movement of food from the oral cavity -> oropharynx -> laryngopharynx -> oesophagus. The function of these muscles is related to fibre orientation

What are the 3 functions of muscles in the pharynx
?
dilator: transversely oriented fibres in the rostral pharynx, acts to widen the rostral pharynx to allow it to accept the bolus of food
shorteners: longitudinally (rostro-caudally) oriented, acts to shorten the pharynx and draw the pharynx forward over the bolus of food
constrictors: rostral, middle, caudal pharyngeal constrictors, originate from either side of the pharynx and meet in the dorsal midline to form arches of muscle that can constrict in succession to move the bolus of food caudally toward the oesophagus

What nerves innervate the sensory and motor aspects of the pharynx::glossopharyngeal nerve (CN 9)  and the vagus nerve (CN 10)
