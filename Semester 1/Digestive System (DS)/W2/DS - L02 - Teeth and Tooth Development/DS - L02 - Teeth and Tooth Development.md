# DS - L2 - Teeth and Tooth Development

## Intended Learning Outcomes
- Describe the general structure of a tooth and explain how the different tissues contribute to tooth function 
- Compare the development and general structure of brachydont and hypsodont teeth
- Relate the different embryonic cell types to the dental structures they form

## Teeth Overview

Where are the located::In the maxilla and the mandible

What type of bone are teeth found inside and what does that bone contain::alveolar bone which contains socket because alveo means socket

What are the surfaces of teeth
?
Vestibular: Space between the lips/cheecks and the teeth
Labial: Another name for the vestibular surface if the tooth is facing the lips
Buccal: Another name for the vestibular surface if the tooth is facing the teeth
Occlusal: The surface that comes in contact with food / other teeth
Lingual: The surface that faces the tongue
Palatine: Another name for the lingual surface in the upper arcade
Interdental/Inter-proximal: Name for the surface that faces other teeth
Mesial: Another name for the interdental surface that faces the midline
Distal: Another name for the interdental surface that faces away from the midline

What are the two main types of teeth and what do they mean
?
Brachydont: "Short crown", which have a root and crown, limited period of growth and eruption
Hypsodont: "High crown", Contain clinical crown, reserve crown, and a root, adapted for high rates of wear. Have a long period of growth and eruption

Which tooth type is found in solely carnivores::Brachydont

What teeth types do carnivores, herbivores, and omnivores have
Brachydont: Carnivores + omnivores
Hypsodont: Omnivores + herbivores

Do all hypsodont teeth form roots::No not all hypsodont teeth form roots such as in rabbits and rats

What is the name of hypsodont teeth that don't grow roots::aradicular hypsodont

Where is the enamel found::Only on the crown of the tooth

What forms the bulk of the tooth::Dentine

What holds the tooth together and what is the difference between the two teeth types
?
Cementine
Brachydont: Will only cover the root
Hypsodont: May cover the whole teeth

What is the internal cavity of the tooth called and what are teeth embedded in::Pulp cavity, and bone

What connects to the alveolar bone::Gingiva (gum)

What are the differences between the crown, clinical crown, and reserve crown::Both crown and clinical crown have erupted but the reserve grown is below the gum line

What is the name of the feature unique to brachydont teeth when they erupt::The neck which is a slight inward concave

At what end is the tooth foramen found::Apical

What cells synthesize the enamel, where are they found::ameloblasts, before eruption under the gum line and are lost upon eruption

Can enamel be repaired after a tooth has erupted::No, because the ameloblasts are gone

What is the hardest surface in the body and what is the mineral content::enamel, 96-98% mineral content

What mineral content primarily composes the enamel::Hydroxyapatite which is a calcium phosphate which is the inorganic component of bones and teeth. The crystal structure differs from dentine and cementin

T/F cells remain in enamel after eruption::False, no cells remain

What cells create dentine::odontoblasts

What tissue forms the majority of the hard material of the tooth::dentine

What are the 3 types of dentine and how do they differ::primary, secondary, tertiary and differ in crystalline structure and degree of mineralization

Where are each of the 3 types of dentine produced
?
Primary: When the odontoblasts are nearest the enamel layer during tooth formation
Secondary: Laid down more slowly and results in the narrowing of the pulp cavity with age. In brachydont teeth it is produced after root formation is complete.
Tertiary: Produced in response to injury or damage

What is the secondary dentine responsible for in equine teeth::Preventing pulp cavity exposure at the occlusal surface that arises from normal wear of the tooth

What is the potential function of tertiary dentine in the horse tooth::Preventing the tip of the pulp cavity from exposure

What is the difference between the composition of primary and secondary dentine::Secondary is less mineralized and so appears opaque, can absorb plant pigments and become stained.

What does the reduced mineralization allow us to landmark in equine teeth::The occlusal star

When is the occlusal star most visible::In young horses, as the horses age the orientation of the tubules in the secondary dentine changes developing a white spot

Describe the process through which dentine is sensitive::The dentine starts at the outer surface of the pulp cavity. As they move away, they leave behind long processes which can transfer pain.

T/F the dentine at the occlusal surface of a horse is sensitive::False, due to calcification at the secondary dentine it is not sensitive. This is why we can trim horse teeth however, trimming too short can cause pain

What is the composition of dentine::Dentine is a mineralized extra cellular matrix composed of 70% mineral content and 30% bone including collagen fibres, and mucopolysaccharides.

What is the structural protein of connective tissue and what produces it::Collagen which is produced by fibroblasts

Are there any cells remaining in the dentine and if so which ones::There are no cells embedded in the dentine

What cells produce cementum::cementoblasts

What does cementum surround::The dentine and secures the periodontal ligament, in hypsodont teeth it may also contribute to the bulk and strength of the crown

What is the composition of cementum and how does it's degradation compare to bone::60-65% mineral content remaining is connective tissue. Does not degrade as readily as bone

T/F Cementum will not be stained by plant pigments::False, cementum can become stained like secondary or tertiary dentine

What comprises the dental pulp::connective tissue with abundant blood vessels, and nerves with some being sensory and others handling the dilation of blood vessels

Where do the blood vessels and nerves in the dental pulp enter::The apical foramen

What are the names of the nerves in the dental pulp which regulate sensation::The superior and inferior alveolar nerves, blood vessels are also named the same.

Where does the superior alveolar nerve originate from::Maxillary branch of the trigeminal nerve which comes from the maxilla

Where does the inferior alveolar nerve originate::Mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve which comes from the mandible

What is the trigeminal nerve::Cranial nerve which supplies somatic (heat, pain, touch, temperature, pressure) sensory innervation to most of the head

Where is the periodontal ligament located and is it's function::Between the cementum and the alveolar bone and it anchors the tooth inside the socket. It allows some movement of the tooth and has shock absorbing function to accommodate compression during chewing.

What are the parts of the alveolar bone
?
Alveolar process: Another name for the entirety of the alveolar bone
Lamina dura (Alveolar bone proper): Lining of the socket
Cancellous bone (spongy bone): Upper section of bone closest to to the tip of the tooth
Cortical bone (compact bone): Solid section of bone closest the root

What comprises the periodontal ligament
?
Collagen fibre bundles  called sharpies fibres that connect the lamina dura to the cementum which are produced by fibroblasts

What cells are found between the cementum and the lamina dura::fibroblasts, cementoblasts, undifferentiated mesenchymal cells, connective tissue cells, epithelial cells, and bone cells.

What is the location and function of the gingiva::Covers the alveolar bone and surrounds the teeth. 

What are the parts of the gingiva
?
Free gingiva: Forms a collar around the grown and is separated from the tooth by a space called the gingival sulcus
Attached gingiva: Extends apically from the free gingiva and to merge with the oral mucosa at the mucogingival margin
Mucogingival margin: Junction between the tough keratonized gingival mucosa and the soft oral mucosa
Interdental papilla: Gingival peak between adjacent teeth

What binds the gingiva to bone::Collagen fibres

## Tooth Development

What type of teeth do mammals have and what are they
?
Diphyodonts which have two sets of teeth
Decidious set of teeth that is temporary and lost
Permanent set with stronger larger teeth that are better adapter to the larger jaw and increased chewing requirements of the adult animal

What is an animal with one set of dentition called::Monophyodont, such as some rodents

What is an animal with more than 2 sets of dentition called::Polyphydont (multiple succession), such as elephants. This is common to most vertebrates, when one tooth wears away another replaces it.

Where does tooth development occur::In the primitive oral cavity (stomodeum) of the embryo

What is lines the stomodeum::Ecotoderm, which is an epithelial layer which lies overtop the mesenchym which is the embryonic connective tissue layer

The dental laminar is paired with what::The enamel organ

The vestibular is paired with what::The vestibular organ

What two layers contribute to the formation of the tooth::The oral ectoderm and the mesenchyme

Describe the process of tooth formation
?
1. The oral ectoderm thickens into two parallel regions along the inner margins of the maxillary and mandibular processes. 
2. The vestibular laminar becomes thicker annd more invaginated at the labia gingal groove will form the vestibule.
3. The thickening of the oral ectoderm will also cause the formation of the dental laminar. 
4. At the bud stage the dental laminar will form a series of thickenings called tooth buds or dental buds. At the same time the mesenchymal cells beneath these buds begin to proliferate.
5. During the cap stage the dental buds expand to from the capped shapped enamel organ which encloses the mesenchymal condensation which is now called the dental papilla. The decidous teeth and permanent molars will develop in these enamel organs. Other permanent teeth will form from seperate dental buds located on the lingual aspect of the dental laminar
6. At the bell stage, further invagination of the dental papilla causes the enamel organ to become more concave. The mesenchymal cells on the outside of the dental organ condense to form the dental sac. Cell differentiation now begins. The ectodermal cells lining the concave aspect of the enamel become the internal or inner enamel epithelium. The cells lining the convex aspect of the enamel organ become the external enamel epithelium. Between these two regions the cells become star shaped cells of the stellic reticulum to support enamel development. The uppermost layer of the dental papilla become the odontoblasts which begin producing dentine. The internal enamel epithelial cells differentiate to form ameloblasts which produce enamel.
7.  These differentiated cells move away from their secretions so that they don't become embedded in them.

Which two regions create the inner and outer enamel epithelium
?
Inner: Concave aspect
Outer: Convex aspect

What is the name of the cells that form between the inner and outer enamel epithelium and what is their function::star shaped cells of the stellic reticulum and they support enamel development

What happens after crown formation is complete::The internal and external enamel epithelial cells in the neck region start to proliferate downward to form the epithelial root sheath. 

What happens after the root sheath breaks down::The inner layer of dental sac cells comes into contact with the dentine which causes the inner layer of dental sac cells to differentiate into cementoblasts and the cementoblasts start to lay down cementum on the outer aspect of the dentine and the root

What does ongoing dentine production cause::The pulp cavity is reduced to a narrow root canal

What cells form the periodontal ligament::Fibroblasts

What gives rise to the alveolar bone::The outer layer of the dental sac which becomes osteoblasts which form the alveolar bone

What does the dental sac give rise to what cells and what do those cells produce
?
Cementoblasts: lay down cementum
Fibroblasts: which create the periodontal ligament
Osteoblasts: which form the alveolar bone

Describe tooth eruption::As teeth develop the root pushes against the bone moving the tooth towards the oral cavity as it grows. The tooth follows the remnants of the ectoderm (dental laminar) connecting the enamel organ to lining of the oral cavity. The tooth grows towards the surface and the crown erupts through the oral epithelium. 

When does enamel production cease::When the enamel organ is shed

T/F Lost enamel can be replaced::False, once the tooth erupts the enamel organ is lost thereby not allowing lost enamel to be replaced

T/F When the tooth erupts the odontoblasts stop producing dentine::False, the odontoblasts continue to produce dentine throughout the lifetime of the organism. This allows enamel to be replaced by dentine if the enamel gets damaged.

What happens to the permanent tooth bud when the decidious tooth erupts::Moves into the socket of the temporary tooth and the permanent enamel organ begins to form.

What causes the temporary tooth to fall out::The permanent enamel organ exerts pressure on the root of the temporary tooth causing degradation of the root, leading to loosening and eventual shedding of the temporary tooth. The permanent tooth will then erupt as it's root forms.

What do the remaining processes in the dental and enamel cause::Fracture planes and remaining processes inside dentine can allow them to be come sensitive.

What type of tooth has a longer enamel organ::Hypsodont

T/F Hypsodont teeth may have a folded surface::True

When does hypsodont teeth eruption occur and at what speed::Slow and before root formation

When does root formation begin in the two types of teeth
?
Hypsodont: Before eruption
Brachyodont: After eruption

What is the difference in cementoblasts between the two types of teeth
?
Hypsodont: Dental sac cells over the crown can also convert into cementoblasts so that cement can be deposited over the entire crown including the occlusary surface.
Brachyodont: Confined to the root

T/F Hypsodont teeth can have a thin layer of enamel and cement before eruption::True

What factors determine the thickness of cement on the occulsary surface of hypsodont teeth::Location, type of tooth, rate of growth, rate of eruption
