## Species Dentition Overview

### Dogs
What is heterodonty::The specialisation of teeth across the mouth to perform a variety of function

Where are the upper incisors located::In the incisive bone

What teeth are most rostral in the maxilla::Upper canines

Where are the teeth of the lower arcade embedded::mandible

What teeth are responsible for prehension (grasping of food) and what is their other function::incisors, also for cutting off and tearing of food

What is the responsibility of the canines in the mouth::tearing, biting, ripping prey and killing

What is the differentiation feature between molars and premolars::premolars have a deciduous precursor while molars do not

What is the premolar tooth which does not have deciduous precursor and what is it's name in horses::premolar 1 also known as the wolf's tooth in horses

What is the function of the premolars in herbivores::grinding food

What is the function of premolars and molars in carnivores::cutting and crushing food

How are teeth number::In rostral order (1 at front and grows cranial)

How many incisors, canines, premolars and molars are there in dogs top and bottom
?
3 1 4 2
3 1 4 3 
for a total of 42 teeth (3+1+4+2+3+1+4+3) x 2

What types of teeth are found in carnivores::brachyodont

How many cusps on incisors::3 aka incisors are tricuspid in dogs

How many roots does each incisor in a dog have::1 root

What teeth in dogs have a single root::incisors, canines, premolar 1 and molar 3

What teeth in dogs have 2 roots:: upper premolar 2 and 3, rest of teeth found in the mandible that aren't single root

What teeth in dogs have 3 roots::Upper premolar 4, upper molar 1 + 2 have 3 roots

What is important when dealing with teeth that have multiple roots::That the crown be divided during extraction

What are the carnassial teeth::upper premolar 4 and lower molar 1, which are adapted for tearing or shearing flesh or meat. The occlusion edges sharp to help with cutting and tearing while the occlusial mountain is caudally blunt for the crushing of bone

What happens when premolar 4 is damaged in canines::The pulp cavity can be exposed which can lead to subsequent infection. Premolar 4 is a common location for this to occur.

### Cats
What teeth do cats lack::Teeth designed for crushing of bone, upper premolar 1

What is the dental formula for cats::(3 1 3 1 | 3 1 2 1) x 2 for a total of 30 teeth

### Pigs
How many teeth are piglets born with::8 fully erupted deciduous teeth, 4 incisors, 4 canines, these teeth are very sharp. Some farmers will cut the teeth to reduce risk of damage to piglets and the sow however there are concerns with this so there are other management strategies being used.

What are other management strategies instead of tooth trimming in piglets::Cross fostering where piglets from large litters get moved to smaller litters to spread out the numbers.

What direction to the incisors in a pig project and why is it important, and what type of teeth are they::forward so that they can dig, brachyodont

What is the dental formula of a pig::(3 1 4 3 | 3 1 4 3 ) x 2 = 44 teeth

What type of teeth are pig canines (tusks)::hypsodont teeth used for tearing and are directed laterally

Are pig canines larger in sows or bores::bores, in sows they stop growing at 2 years of age while in bores they continue growing throughout the live of the animal hypsilophodont.

T/F breeding bore tusks should not be trimmed as they are painful for the animal::False, bore tusks require regular trimming preferably with an abrasive wire to prevent sharp points. It is done to prevent injuries to handlers or other animals. It is important note to trim too close to the gumline.

What happens if you trim a bore tusk too close to the gumline::expose the pulp cavity

What type of teeth are the cheek teeth in the pig::brachyodont, developed for crushing or grinding, small cusps, table of crushing and grinding teeth.

### Horses

Horse dentition is completed by what age::5

How many cheek teeth do horses have::12, 6 per side

What type of teeth do herbivores have and what are they suited for::hypsodont, extensive crushing and grinding

What is the dental formula of a horse:: (3 1(0) 3(4) 3 | 3 1(0) 3(4) 3) x 2 = 36 - 44

At what age does growth in the apical part of the horse tooth stop:age 17

T/F eruption of the horse tooth stops at age 17::False, the eruption of the tooth continues for life due to the occlusial wear of about 3 mm per year

What does the difference in eruption and growth mean for the dentition of geriatric horses::Some older horses can have the dentition wear down until it reaches the level of the roots as the tooth continues to erupt even after growth has stopped.

What are the alternative names for the incisors in a horse::central incisor, middle incisors, corner incisors.

T/F enamel is continuous across the occlusial surface of horse incisors::False, enamel may not be continuous and there will be exposed dentine

What is the infundibulum in horse teeth::A cup shaped structure in the occlusial surface of the incisors. When it is still hollow or cupped shaped it is called a cup and when it reaches the bottom of the cup it is referred to as the mark.

What protects the pulp cavity in older horses and what is it's alternate name::secondary and tertiary dentine, and the pulp cavity is also known as the star

Where is cementum found in the equine tooth::On the outside of the tooth and in the infundibulum

Where does the dental star begin to appear in the equine tooth::Nearest the labial surface

How does the shape of the horse tooth change as they age::Goes from oval to triangular shaped with age

What is the order of eruption for incisors in the horse::central, middle, corner

What would cause the star of the equine tooth to appear white vs dark brown::The diet of the horse, the pigments of plants will stain the star brown due to the secondary dentine but a wheat or grain based diet will not stain as badly and could leave the star with a whiteish appearance.

What is more rostral, the star or the cup in the equine tooth::star

At what age do the equine canines erupt::typically 4 to 6 years of age

T/F equine canines do not have a deciduous precursor::False, although the precursor does not erupt above the gumline

T/F All horses have canines::False, horses may have no canines

Where are the canines in the horse found::In the diastema which is a space between teeth

What is another name for the long diastema (interdental space) in horses::The bars of the mouth

Where does the bit for horses rest::In the bars of the mouth

What type of teeth are equine canines::brachyodont but they do have hypsodont features such as a long reserve crown which makes extraction difficult but they do not continue to grow like hypsodont teeth

What type of tooth is the wolf's tooth in horses::1st premolar which is a vestigial brachyodont tooth. Usually erupts at 6 to 12 months of age and has no deciduous precursor.

Why would the wolf's tooth need to be removed in horses::May interfere with the seating of the bit

What is the hardest of the dental surfaces::enamel which is why it will wear slower

What cheek teeth are wider apart in the horse, mandibular or maxillary::maxillary

Why do horse teeth form sharp points that require filling and where are they located::Because the maxillary cheek teeth are further apart than the mandibular cheek teeth that leads to the formation of sharp teeth on the buccal aspect of the maxillary arcade and the lingual aspect of mandibular arcade. The other term for this filling is floating.

T/F The grinding surface of horse teeth are angled::True, due to the maxillary cheek teeth being wider apart

Where can a hook form in equine dentition::Upper premolar 2 as it does not completely occlude with lower premolar 2

### Ruminants

What is the dental formula of the ox/sheep::(0 0 3 3 | 3 1 3 3) x 2 = 32

What replaces the ruminant upper incisors and canines::The dental pad

The lower incisors and canines in ruminants are what type of teeth::brachyodont because they don't have continuous eruption

What are the name of the incisors in ruminants::central, medial, lateral, corner

What direction do the cheek teeth increase in size in ruminants::rostral to caudal

T/F the lower cheek teeth are more widely separated in ruminants::False, the upper cheek teeth are more widely separated

### Alpacas and Llamas

What is the dental formula for alpacas and llamas::(1 1 1(2) 3 | 3 1 1(2) 3) x 2 = 28 - 32

What incisors are alpacas and llamas missing and which ones do they retain and why::They are missing upper incisors 1 and 2 which is replaced by a dental pad. They retain upper incisor 3 which is canine in appearance which when combined with the lower incisors and canines from the fighting teeth

What teeth should be trimmed on alpacas and llamas and why::The fighting teeth should be trimmed to prevent injury. They are present on both males and females but are larger in males and should be trimmed with abrasive wire such as an embryotomy wire or a small grinding tool. 

When does fighting teeth trimming cease in young male alpacas and llamas::at about 7 years of age when tooth growth ceases. 

Why are fighting teeth not extracted in alpacas and llamas::The long roots of the teeth make it difficult and the risk of injury to the jaw or adjacent teeth is high.

T/F the lower incisors in alpacas are hypsodont and may require trimming::True, due to the hypsodont nature these teeth may require trimming if overgrown. This usually results from malocclusion between the incisors and the dental pad.

T/F the lower incisors on alpacas may be trimmed for aesthetics::False, these teeth should only be trimmed if it is a problem for the animal

T/F an angle grinder is an appropriate tool for trimming alpaca incisors::False, an angle grinder is not appropriate as there is a risk of injury to the tissues of the jaw due to overheating. 

What type of teeth are cheek teeth in alpacas and llamas::Brachyodont but they do have folded enamel ridges which may require floating or filling.

### Rabbits

What is the dental formula for rabbits::(2 0 3 3 | 1 0 2 3) x 2 = 28

What type of teeth do rabbits have and why are they unique::aradicular hypsodont or hypselodont teeth. These teeth do not develop roots and grow and erupt continuously throughout life.

Why would an animal have aradicular hypsodont or hypselodont teeth::Due to a highly abrasive diet and prolonged chewing

T/F rabbits are a diphyodonts::True, rabbits have both a permanent and temporary set of teeth, although the temporary teeth are replaced after day 35

T/F rabbits have canine teeth::False, rabbits do not have canine teeth

T/F rabbit incisors only have enamel rostrally and dentine caudally::True, this is what results in the sharp chisel shaped occlusial surfaces of rabbit incisors

Describe how rabbit incisors developed their chisel like shape
?
Ameloblasts that form enamel are only located on the labial aspect of the apical end of the tooth
Odontoblasts that form dentine are only found on the lingual aspect of the apical end of the tooth
The grinding diet causes dentine to be worn away before the enamel creating the chisel shape

What are the names of the smaller upper incisors in rabbits and where are they located::pig teeth and immediately caudal of the first incisors

T/F rabbits must be sedated for you to clip the incisors due to malocclusion::False, due to the pulp cavity only extending about 3 mm beyond the gumline, the incisors may be clipped while the animal is conscious.

Why is it important to examine the cheek teeth when examining a rabbit for malocclusion of the incisors::Overgrowth of the incisors is often reflective of malocclusion of the cheek teeth so it is important to check the cheek teeth to ensure there are no other underlying problems causing malocclusion of the incisors

T/F nail clippers or bone rongeurs are appropriate for trimming rabbit incisors::False, these tools can split the tooth and therefore it is recommended to use a grinding tool

How fast to rabbit incisors and cheek teeth grow per month::8 - 10 mm, 3 - 4 mm

### Rodents

T/F all rodents are omnivores::False, rodents can be herbivores or omnivores

How many incisors do rodents have and what type of teeth are they::2 upper, 2 lower, hypselodont

Where is the enamel located on rodent incisors::Only on the rostral aspect

What is the pigment colour of rodent teeth and give an exception::yellow orange, but guinea pigs are an exception

What causes the pigmentation of rodent teeth and where does it occur::superficial enamel and is iron based

T/F rodents can be monophyodont::True, rats are an example of a monophyodont rodent

T/F guinea pigs have hypselodont cheek that grow continuously::True

T/F all rodent cheek teeth are hypselodont::False, omnivorous rodents such as the old world rat have brachyodont cheek teeth

## Ageing Animals Using Dentition

What are some factors that affect the accuracy of ageing via dentition in animals::breed, genetics, age, malocclusion, filing or trimming, diet, environment, behaviour

### Dog and Cat

What is the eruption pattern for dog/cat teeth
?
Birth: no teeth
Deciduous teeth: 3 to 6 weeks
Permanent teeth: 4 to 7 months

How can we examine dog/cat teeth for age::Examine tricuspid incisors for wear and reduction of points on the canines

How can behaviour affect the rate of wear of dog teeth::Activities such as chewing on toys or tennis balls can cause the teeth to wear faster

### Horses

What are the main criteria used to age horses::eruption dates of deciduous and permanent incisors, changes in occlusial morphology of the permanent incisors. Cheek teeth are not included because they are difficult to access as the gape of the mouth of a horse is very small

What is the eruption pattern of horse teeth
?
1st deciduous incisor: 1 week (6 days)
2nd deciduous incisor: 4-6 weeks of age (6 weeks)
3rd deciduous incisor: 6-9 months of age (6 months)
1st permanent incisor: 2.5 years
2nd permanent incisor: 3.5 years
3rd permanent incisor: 4.5 years
About 6 months before the incisor becomes in wear

What is the difference between deciduous and permanent incisors in a horse::The deciduous incisors are smaller than the permanents and the crown is white, permanent are large and more rectangular and the grown appears yellowing in part due to cementum

What are some ways other than tooth eruption can we asses the age of the horse::Incisor occlusial surface changes, appearance of the dental star which changes shape and position with age, dental cup or mark which is the infundibulum (problem is the depth can be different so time of disappearance is not reliable), upper corner incisor shape, curvature of the dental arch, caudal angle between upper and lower incisors

T/F the cup appearances once the infundibulum has been warn down to the enamel bottom::False, it is referred to as the cup before it is worn down to the enamel at which point it is referred to as the mark

T/F the shape of the horse tooth starts in the mesiodistal direction::True and it slowly becomes triangular shape and eventually orientates to be oval shaped in a labial lingual direction

T/F the corner of the upper corner incisor can be used to estimate age in horses::True, it starts wider than it is tall (5-9 years of age) then becomes square (10 years of age) but becomes taller than it is wide (10+ years of age)

How does the curvature of the dental arch change as the horse gets older::Goes from semi circular to straighter as the animal ages

How does the caudal angle of the upper and lower incisors change in a horse as it ages::becomes more acute

What happens if the lower incisors become oblique faster than the upper incisors in horses::this can result in the formation of a hook in the upper corner incisor. This occurs when the caudal edge of the upper incisor exceeds the caudal edge of the lower incisor

What is Galvayne's groove::groove in longitudinal surface of the upper corner incisor which is no longer recommended for estimating age and it is absent in nearly half of horses

### Ox

T/F some teeth in the ox may be erupted at birth::True, and eruption of all deciduous incisors is complete by week 4

How does the shape of the incisors change as the ox ages::They start short and broad but become longer and more narrow as the animal ages

What is the eruption time for incisors in the ox
?
Birth: some deciduous
Milk tooth: animal with no permanent incisors
1st permanent incisor: 1 year
2nd permanent incisor: 2 years
3rd permanent incisor: 3 years
canine / incisor 4: at 4 years of age

After all permanent teeth is erupted how do we assess an ox for age::After 5 years of age when all permanent teeth are present we observe for levelling which is when the ridges on the lingual surface of the tooth is observed. If ridges are present the tooth is not considered to be levelled. You are observing for a smooth convex surface

Describe the levelling tooth pattern in the ox
?
central: 6 years
middle: 7 years
laterals:  8 years
all incisors: 9 years

What is the definition of a lamb in Australia::An ovine animal with no permanent incisors in wear

When teeth break in a sheep they are termed what and whey they have no teeth they are termed what::broken mouth, gummy mouth
