## Pancreatic and Biliary Secretions

Describe the structure of the pancreas in the dog and the cat
?
Lies close to the stomach and the duodenum
Body with two lobes
In dogs: **Pancreatic duct and accessory pancreatic duct; two duodenal papillae**
In cats: only **one pancreatic duct, one duodenal papilla**

Outline the structure and function of the pancreas
?
Exocrine function
- Tubuloacinar secretory units, continuous with intercalated duct that **secretes enzymes**
- Duct cells extend into the lumen, hence called centro-acinar cells which **secrete electrolytes**
Endocrine function - islets of Langerhans
- Glucagon ($\alpha$) and insulin ($\beta$) cells
Intralobular ducts, leading into interlobular ducts

Outline the structure of the pancreatic ducts
?
Acinar cells are involved in the secretion of enzymes
Zymogen cells secrete digestive enzymes that are responsible for eosinophilic staining in apical cell regions, basophilic staining in basal cell regions associated with staining of rough ER
Zymogens = stomach enzymes
Ductal cells secrete electrolytes. Pale staining, Also called centro-acinar cells. Secrete bicarbonate. Carbonic acid bicarbonate is being released into of protons

What do the ductal cells secrete
? 
Electrolytes 
- NaHCO3
  - Neutralises acidic chyme
  - Optimal pH for pancreatic enzymes

What do the Acinar cells secrete
?
Enzymes 
Trypsinogen: cleaved by enterokinase (released in the small intestine) to trypsin
Chymotrypsinogen: activated by trypsin
Procarboxypeptidase: activated by trypsin
Pancreatic amylase: secreted in active form
Pancreatic lipase: secreted in active form

What is the major source of lipase::Pancras

What are the 3 phases of secretion of the pancreas
?
Cephalic (long reflexes from vagus)
Gastric (vago vagal from stomach or enterogastrones, intrinsic nerve pathway)
Secretory

Outline the cephalic phase
?
Account for 20% of secretion associated with a meal
Ingestion of food (w/o swallowing) --> Increased pancreatic secretion
Can be blocked by atropine (blocking vagal nn)
Regulated by vagal efferent nerves to the pancreas
Stimulation result in
- Increased volume
- Increased enzyme content

Outline the gastric phase
?
Stretching of stomach
- --> increased secretion
- This response is abolished by a section of vagus nn
- Hence vago-vagal
Presence of food in pyloric antrum
- --> increased secretion
- This response persists after sectioning vagal nn
- Another enterogastric reflex
- The response can be stimulated by I/V administration of the pyloric extract
- Found to be mediated by Gastrin

What is the most important stimulation for the pancreas::presence of chyme in the duodenum?

Outline the pancreatic intestinal phase
?
Stimuli associated with the presence of chyme in the duodenum
Most potent stimuli to pancreatic secretion
Different substances instilled into the duodenum stimulate characteristically different pancreatic secretion
FA, AA, and Hydrogen ions are important in triggering secretions
Hydrogen ions stimulate S cells in the duodenum to release secretin which causes the ductal cells to release bicarbonate
FA or AA causes the release of cholecystokinin (CCK) which stimulates vagal afferent nerves which go to the brain and the vagal efferents stimulate the acinar cells to release enzymes 

How do acid, protein, and fat, change the secretion from the pancreas
?
Acid --> Electrolyte section
Protein --> enzyme secretion
Fat --> electrolytes and enzymes

Outline the role of secretin in the pancreas
?
"Nature's antacid"
The presence of acid in the duodenum leads to 
- Secretin release from S cells in the duodenum
- Stimulation of duct cells to secrete aqueous bicarbonate solution
Secretin also inhibits gastric secretion and emptying
Important to raise pH as duodenal enzymes work at a higher pH than stomach enzymes

Outline the role of Cholecystokinin (CCK) in the pancreas
?
Presence of fatty acids or protein in the duodenum
CCK released from the duodenum and transported in bloodstream to the pancreas
Stimulation of acinar cells to secrete digestive enzymes (with very little change in volume of secretion)
Pancreatic enzyme secretion is able to adapt to diet because CCK changes gene expression in acinar cells
- Increased protein in diet --> up-regulation of proteases and down-regulation of amylase

Provide a summary of the pancreas
?
The pancreas is both an exocrine and endocrine gland
Pancreas secretes:
- Enzymes: amylase and lipase proteases
- Electrolytes: bicarbonate ions
Control of secretion involves:
- Vagus nerve
- Enterogastric reflexes
- Enterogastrones-gastrin,  CCK, secretin
- Cephalic, gastric and intestinal stimuli to secretion

What is the role of the liver:: a metabolic organ, an exocrine gland, a complex filter and detoxifier

What are the primary functions of the liver
?
Important in fat digestion because of the secretion of bile salts
Metabolic processing of nutrients following absorption
Detoxification and degradation of body metabolic waste, hormones, drugs, etc.
Synthesis of plasma proteins and many clotting factors
Storage of glycogen, fats, iron, copper and many vitamins
Removal of bacteria and effect RBC's
Excretion of cholesterol and bilirubin

Explain the structure of hepatocytes
?
Excretion: waste products
Secretion: bile
Storage: lipids, vitamins A, B, and glycogen
Detoxification: drugs
Metabolism: proteins, CHO, lipids, HB

What is the fine structure of the hepatocyte
?
A multi-function cell with many organelles
Central nucleus
Rough and smooth ER
Golgi apparatus
Mitochondria
Membrane specialisations
- Two surfaces facing sinusoids - microvilli
- Lateral surfaces with bile canaliculi, microvilli, and tight junctions

Describe the arrangement of the hepatocytes in the liver
?
Arranged into plates (one cell thick) that in section resemble "cords"
Plates are orientated with respect to vessels
Plates of hepatocytes separated by sinusoids
Sinusoids lined by:
- Endothelial cell
- Macrophages (Kupffer cells)

What are the vessels which supply the hepatocytes
?
Hepatic artery
Portal vein
The liver has a DUAL blood supply
Hepatocytes are bathed on both sides by well-mixed blood from the portal vein and hepatic artery representing 25% of cardiac output

What are the vessels that drain hepatocytes?
?
Bile duct
Hepatic vein

Describe the gradation from canaliculi
?
--> Ductule
--> Duct

What species do not have gall bladders::Horse, rats, elephants, and some deer lack GB

Outline the gallbladder
?
The Sphincter of Oddi regulates duodenal bile duct opening
Bile is stored and concentrated in GB
Species without GB are able to upregulate bile production when required

What are the important aspects of bile
?
Bile salts: important in fat digestion
Cholesterol: an excretory product clinically significant because of its role in the formation of gallstones
Bile pigments: products of red blood cell breakdown
Bicarbonate: secreted by ductal cells

What is in bile
?
Hepatocytes add:
- Bile salts
- Cholesterol
- Lecithin
- Bile pigments = bilirubin
Ductal cells add:
- bicarbonate solution
Bile primarily functions in the absorption and digestion of FAT

T/F the gall bladder produces bile::False, liver does

T/F the liver bile is more concentrated than the gall bladder bile::False, the gall bladder is more concentrated

## Components of Bile

What are bile salts
?
Derivatives of cholesterol
Synthesised by hepatocytes from cholesterol and then conjugated to either taurine or glycine
The conjugation step creates a highly polar molecule
Thus conjugated bile salts act as detergents
Bile salts aggregate spontaneously with fat to form MICELLES
Micelles have a hydrophobic core and a hydrophilic outer shell.

Outline the variability of bile salts
?
There are many different bile salts
Evolutionary advantage to keeping fat soluble over a wide pH range
Bile salts are actively secreted into the bile
Secreted bile salts have 2 sources:
- Newly formed Bile Salts in hepatocytes from cholesterol (5%)
- Bile salts return to the liver following absorption in the ileum (95%)

Outline the role of cholesterol in bile secretion
?
A large amount of cholesterol in bile
Bile salts keep cholesterol in solution (allows supersaturated solution)
The relative increase in cholesterol concentration may result in the precipitation of cholesterol (gallstones)

Outline the formation of bile pigments
?
Haemoglobin is broken down in the Monocyte macrophage system into biliverdin and bilirubin
Bilirubin is transported in Systemic circulation bound to albumin
**In Hepatocytes**: Bilirubin is conjugated --> bilirubin glucuronide (soluble) and secreted (active process) to bile
**In the intestine**: 
- Bilirubin converted to urobilinogen
- Urobilinogen absorbed in the ileum OR
- Oxidised to stercobilin (brown) excreted (gives faeces brown colour)

What is jaundice
?
If circulating bilirubin concentration is > 0.3-0.5 mmol/L --> jaundice
Causes
- Pre-hepatic (increased production)
- Hepatic (liver can't keep up)
- Post hepatic (obstructed bile ducts)

What are the secretory mechanisms of bile
?
Bile acid (salt) dependent (enterohepatic circulation)
Bile acid (salt) independent ductular secretion (controlled as for pancreatic ductal secretion by the hormone secretin)

Outline enterohepatic circulation and Bile salt-dependent flow
?
Approximately 20g of bile salts are required to digest and absorb 100g of fat
Total bile salts in the body <5g
98% of secreted bile salts are reabsorbed, and only 0.5g of new bile salts are synthesised per day
During a meal, bile salts digest fat and returned to the liver via the ileum increasing production
Between meals, secretion is low
In the jejunum, reabsorption is passive while in the ileum reabsorption is active.
**Dysfunction or removal of the ileum will alter normal fat absorption**

Outline how bile pigments are reabsorbed in enterohepatic circulation
?
Bile pigments are also reabsorbed
Bilirubin is converted by intestinal bacteria
- Urobilinogen, urobilin, urochrome (excreted in urine)
- Stercobilinogen, stercobilin (excreted in faeces)
- Other compounds --> vitamins, drugs, secreted are in bile and reabsorbed e.g. contraceptive pill

Outline how secretin controls ductal secretion into bile
?
Similar to pancreatic NaHCO3 secretion, secretin stimulates an aqueous alkaline bile secretion by duct cells without a corresponding increase in bile salt secretion
- Help neutralise gastric acid entering the duodenum
The stimulus for secretin release is decreasing pH in the duodenal lumen; fat in the duodenal lumen

What are the functions of the gallbladder
?
During the interdigestive period, the Sphincter of Oddi is closed. Bile is diverted to the Gall Bladder
Active reabsorption of Na across GB epithelial cells (passive water with it)
Emptying of GB in response to food
- Rhythmic contraction of GB
- Simultaneous relaxation of the Sphincter of Oddi
- Peristalsis in the duodenum aids sphincter relaxation

What is the stimulus of gall bladder release
?
Cholecystokinin (CCK) --> released in response to fat in the duodenum
Vagal stimulation is a weaker stimulus to Gb emptying. Contributes to the cephalic phase before food reaches stomach of the intestine
