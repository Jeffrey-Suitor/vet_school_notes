# DS - L18 - Diseases of the Forestomach

## Intended Learning Outcomes 
- Describe the aetiopathogenesis of the common disorders of the ruminant forestomach 
- Explain the potential consequences of injury to a forestomach compartment that disturbs its motility, reduces the mucosal absorptive surface area and/or increases mucosal permeability 
- identify the characteristic gross and/or microscopic lesions that are used to reach a specific diagnosis.

## Diseases of the Forestomach

What are the important chambers of the stomach?
?
Reticulum: honeycomb sieve
Rumen: Large fermentation vat
Omasum: which the foodstuff moves through

What are the main things that ruminants do
?
Ruminant: Remasticate, salivate, redeglutate increasing SA and adding saliva
Salivate: Bulk up rumen content and buffer via bicarbonate ions
Eructate: Remove built-up gas

What controls the stomach
?
Vagus nerve (autonomic nervous system), afferents and efferents
Chemo and stretch receptors

Outline papillary development in the rumen
?
With just milk, there are no ruminal papillae
Grain has the greatest stimulus on papillary development
Stunned growth of papillae may indicate sufficient roughage but insufficient concentrates
Has been used in court for malnutrition and neglect cases

In cattle what are some problems that can occur with ruminal papillae
?
Dystrophy of the ruminal papillae which includes the formation of side branches, is due to high levels of concentrates. This can lead to hair fibres and plant fibres getting caught up in the papillae leading to erosions and ulcerations
Hyperkeratosis in this environment and potentially due to vitamin A.

Outline post-mortem examination of a ruminant
?
Size of the ruminant forestomach
Type of material
Consistency
Contents of the ruminant forestomach
- Frothy material: primary bloat
- Excess grain +/- excess water: rumen acidosis
In ruminal acidosis, you can smell a fermented odour
If urea is provided as a non-protein nitrogen supplement you can overdo it and the bacteria can transform that into ammonia which burns the mucosa, and smell a strong ammonia smell
Routinely measure pH using either litmus paper or a calibrated pH meter (preferred)
- Rumen pH of <5 in ruminal acidosis
- Normal pH 5.5 - 7.5
- Urea toxicity will be more alkaline

Outline how milk can go down the wrong tube in a suckling calf
?
Milk can ferment in the rumen if it doesn't properly go into the omasum
This can lead to a chemical rumenitis

What are some abnormal contents one could find in the rumen
?
Yew tree needles can be toxin (smells like furniture polish)
Apricot, cherry, and almonds trees contain hydrogen cyanide which can be fatal to ruminants
Motor oil, petrol, and lead-containing paint could lead to a variety of neurological issues

Why is the rumen washed during a post mortem
?
To observe for redness, hyperaemia which is active inflammation
Stellate scars indicate previous ulcerations which have healed via granulation tissue that has now contracted
This shows current and previous mucosal lesions
No mucosal lesions don't exclude the possibility of there still being a problem
As the postmortem interval increases there is the lifting of the mucosa, which is useful as after a few hours the mucosa should strip easily and if it doesn't then it is likely a site of active inflammation, fibroplasia, active fibroblast proliferation, or previous fibrosis

Outline primary bloat in ruminants
?
Distension or dilation of the rumen, CO2, Methane
Bilateral abdominal distention, with a slightly larger one on left
Stable foam blocks eructation
Normally there is some unstable foam (bubbles pop)
Also called pasture bloat (usually lush, alfalfa, lucerne, etc.) can develop fatal primary bloat due to fresh growth which causes decreased salivation, legume acids reduce pH, soluble proteins in chloroplasts as insoluble proteins that stabilise the foam
In feedlots change in bacterial flora, creates polysaccharides which increase the viscosity of the rumen fluid and stabilise the foam.
Usually, feedlot bloat is slower, and less pronounced than pasture bloat
It is a life-threatening condition that requires trephination (the sharp object used to penetrate into the rumen to allow gas to release)
Dead bloat ruminants usually are bloated with extended limbs, increased pressure blanches forward, respiratory failure and increased abdominal pressure leads to the prevention of effective venous return to the right side of the heart

What is a bloat line
?
The line that demarcates corresponds to the thoracic inlet. 
Found in oesophagus
The Cranial is redder, caudal is paler

T/F in bloat you can always find stable foam in a postmortem::False, depending on when the post-mortem is you may not find foam

What is secondary bloat?
?
There is NO stable foam
This could be due to a physical obstruction, or a functional obstruction such as a vagus issue
Usually not as aggressive
Can be recurrent
Can be found in ruminal drinkers, failure of the oesophageal / reticularomasal groove leads to milk fermentation 
Excess roughage compared to concentrates can lead to secondary bloat as the roughage is retained

Outline foreign bodies in ruminants
?
Cattle most likely to get foreign bodies
A foreign body is something you don't expect to be in the abdomen
phytobezoar and trichobezoar are foreign bodies composed of plant fibres or hair fibres
Can be found in the stomach and in the intestine and rumen.
bezoars are an unimportant finding unless they impair function

What are some causes of over grooming
?
Itchy skin
Bored
Lice
Allergies
Not enough phosphorus in the diet
Parasites

What are some causes of phytobezoar
?
Inability to masticate
Food too hard

Outline hardware disease
?
Found in the reticulum
Cows will eat nails and screws
Can be stopped with rumen magnets
We don't use bailing wire
Traumatic reticuloperitonitis
Any sharp foreign object in the reticulum tends to go cranioventral
Can cause infection with a variety of pus-forming bugs including Tropea pyogenes
Can form abscesses or payo granuloma 
If it passes it can cause peritonitis
If it doesn't go cranioventral it can penetrate the liver and cause a liver abscess
It can also penetrate the diaphragm and hit a lung or the lining of the heart causing pericarditis. Even if they survive they may still die from congestive heart failure

Outline vagus indigestion
?
Ruminants where there is gradual progressive distension on both sides
Absence of ruminal sounds
Due to physical or functional blockage of the drainage of the forestomach or the abomasum
Anything that upsets the stomach sends signals via vagal afferents leading to decreased contractility of the stomach and eventually atony which is a lack of contractility
Abomasum and omasum impacted with quite dry material
Can be secondary to surviving hardware disease
The uterus of pregnant cattle can push leading to vagal indigestion

Outline lactic acidosis
?
Commonly seen in feedlot cattle, who all have different backgrounds and then are brought together on a single lot and fed a lot of concentrates which they may not be used to 
Can be seen in animals on pasture
It has less to do with the volume of carbohydrates and more with the speed at which you change the diet
It's due to not having the correct type of bacteria in the rumen to handle this increased carbohydrate load
Can be fatal
Concentrates ferment and make VFAs and the cattle can absorb the VFAs fast enough, pH stops to drop
This decrease in pH (<5) leads to the death of normal gut flora which increases the presence of streptococcus which further decreases the pH
Below 4.5 streptococcus dies off and lactobacilli
Excess acidity leads to reduced contractility via vagal signals and eventually atony

Describe the damage caused by lactic acidosis
?
The acid itself will burn the ruminal mucosa
Lactic acid draws water out of capillary beds into the rumen which leads to profound dehydration, dark red viscous blood, and excess watery content in the rumen but not guaranteed
Erosions, and ulcers due to chemical burns, may see nothing, look at histology where you can see acidic damage, hydropic degeneration and necrosis and inflammation

Describe survival of lactic acidosis
?
The determination of survivability is about the amount of acid involved, the amount of feed etc
Animals that survive can have residual scarring, large bare areas where no papillae

Outline the secondary infections due to lactic acidosis
?
Ruminal acidosis is the most common cause of rumenitis
Ulcers in the mucosa are a great portal for infection, from normal rumen flora, 
Fusobacterium necrophorum is a regular member of ruminal flora that can infect via ulcers into the lamina propria or deeper tissues leading to reproduction and the release of a necrotising toxin.
Can embolism into the liver giving multifocal areas of coagulative necrosis with hyperaemic margins. If large amounts are present it can kill due to entering circulation causing sepsis, and toxemia, or if the animal survives these areas of necrosis will liquefy giving a standard abscess

Outline the fungal hyphae due to lactic acidosis
?
Zygomycetes enter into the lamina propria or deeper tissues and eventually cause a thrombosis, which can block blood flow and that can cause an infarct leading to ischemic necrosis
Often leads to death due to necrosis going all the way through even to the serosal surface because of superimposed ischemic injury
Fungi can also reach the liver in the same way

What are some other causes of rumenitis 
?
Circulating blood infection leading to necrosis and entry of ruminal bacteria causing ulcers and lesions
HCl from mucosa goes up into the forestomach which causes ulcers and then a secondary infection
BBD Virus, FMD, Parapoxvirus, and Ringapest can all damage the mucosal barrier
Milk putrefaction can also cause ulcerations

Outline how parasites in the forestomach
?
Gongylonema species can cause hemorrhagic lesions, normally incidental in the rumen
Paraphistomum is also incidental
Parasites in the rumen are often incidental

Outline tumours in the forestomach
?
Tumours are incidental unless they are in key locations
Papilloma / fibropapilloma are cauliflower-like growth (warts), nearly always on the skin and triggered by species-specific papillomavirus
Incidental unless on key locations such as cardio or nerves

Detail papilloma vs fibropapilloma
?
How deeply inoculated the virus is, only on the surface is papilloma and more deeply is fibropapilloma
Won't metastisis

What is a squamous cell carcinoma
?
Originate from papillomas
UK, Scotland, Bovine papillomavirus 4 + ptaquiloside (carcinogen) in bracken fern
