## Gastric Acid Secretion

What are the regions of the stomach?
?
Cardiac: mucus-secreting
Fundic/corpus: acid and pepsin secreting
Pyloric/antral: mucous secreting

What is secreted in the stomach
?
Acid (HCL)
Pepsinogen (Activated by low pH --> pepsin)
Mucus

What cells make up the fundic mucosa
?
Pepsinogen - from the chief cell (base of the gland)
Hydrochloric acid - from parietal cells (In the neck)
Mucous
- From surface mucous cell
- From mucous neck cell

What is the structure of the gastric mucosa?
?
A single epithelial layer is thrown into folds: the gastric glands

Where are HCL and pepsin secreted from::Fundic mucosa

Describe the staining of chief cells
?
Pale eosinophilic apical cytoplasm due to the presence of zymogen granules; basophilic basal cytoplasm due to the presence of rough ER for protein (enzyme) synthesis

Outline the staining of gastric parietal cells::large and pale (eosinophilic) cytoplasm

Where do proton pump inhibitors bind?
?
Intracellular canailiculus
A large amount of mitochondria
Hydrogen, potassium ATPase pump

What's special about the gastric parietal cell

Huge membrane surface area
- A canaliculus with or w/o microvilli
- Intracytoplasmic tubulovesicles
Dense with mitochondria
A membrane-linked H/K ATPase (proton) pump
Carbonic anhydrase
Secretion involves the cycling of membrane from the cytoplasm to the cell surface
When food is secreted the membrane is exposed on the surface of the cell

Describe the mechanism of hydrochloric acid secretion
?
Active transport of hydrochloric acid
Membrane bound H+/K+ ATPase
Activity of carbonic anhydrase

How is gastric acid secretion controlled
?
The "one cell" and "two cell" theories of secretion
- EC cell relases histamine locally in response to gastrin* or vagal** stimulation
- Histamine stimulates release of acid from parietal
- Parietal cells can also respond directly to vagal stimulation and to gastrin cimulation
- \* Gastrin is an enterogastrone
- \*\* The vagus nerve contains parasympathetic fibers
- \*\*\* Acetyl choline is the neurotransmitter released from parasympathetic fibers
![[gastric acid secretion.png]]
Mast cell secretes histamine due to either vagal stimulation via ACh or gastrin
Parietal cell secrets because of ACh via vagal stimulation, histamine from mast cell, or gastrin.
Prostaglandins inhibit acid secretion

Outline inhibition of gastric acid release
?
Gastrin release is **increased **by
- Presence of digested protein in the lumen
- Stimulation via the vagus nerve
Gastrin release is **inhibited**
- Somatostatin (released from D cells in antral mucosa) and acting on G cells
- Somatostatin release is increased
  - low pH in the lumen
  - Increasing gastrin levels
- Somatostatin release is inhibited by vagal stimulation

What is another role of parietal cells
?
Evidence that gastric parietal cells in the horse release dopamine, that is secreted into the stomach
Dopamine receptors have been identified in duodenum and pancreas
In the duodenum, dopamine increases bicarbonate secretion, hence buffering gastric acid
Dopamine is secreted into the gastric lumen by parietal cells, exerting its effects on the duodenal mucosa and on the pancreas via circulation

What is the pH of the stomach during the fasting stage::7

What is the pH of the stomach during the feeding stage::1-2

What is the cephalic phase of secretion?
?
Stimuli for secretion:
- Sight/smell of food
- Chewing / taste of food
- Conditioned reflexes
- Swallowing
- Hypoglycemia
Pathways to secretion
- Vagal stimulation of parietal cell
- Vagal stimulation of gastrin release

Outline the gastric phase of secretion
?
Stimuli for secretion:
- Distension of stomach
- Amino acids and peptides in the lumen
- Mechanical stimulation
- Certain drugs (e.g. caffeine)
Pathways to secretion
?
Vago vagal (Afferent and efferent are in the vagus nerve) stimulation of parietal cell
Vagal gastric stimulation of gastrin release

Outline the intestinal phase of secretion
?
Responsible for only 5% of acid secretion
Stimuli for secretion:
- Protein digestion products in the duodenal lumen
Pathways to secretion:
- Gastrin release from duodenal mucosa

How is acid secretion controlled?
?
Nerves - Vagus
- Cephalic phase (long reflexes)
- Gastric phase (long reflexes)
- Intrinsic nerves (short reflexes)
EC cells (enterochromaffin cells)
Hormones
- Histamine, Gastrin, and Secretin are excitatory
- Gastric inhibitory peptides, Cholecystokinin, and Somatostatin are inhibitory

What is the source of enterogastrones?
?
Gastrin: G cells in pyloric antrum and duodenum
Histamine: EC cells in lamina propria of the stomach (in close proximity to parietal cells)
Somatostatin: D cells in the pyloric antrum
Secretin: S cells in duodenal mucosa
Cholecystokinin: EC cells in intestinal walls
Gastric Inhibitory Peptide: EC cells in the intestinal wall

Describe the process of pepsinogen secretion
?
Closely linked to acid secretion as low pH (<5) is required for cleavage of pepsinogen to pepsin
The strongest stimulant to pepsinogen secretion is ACh
- Vagal stimulation in the cephalic and gastric phase
Acid-sensitive stimulation of pepsinogen release through gastric intrinsic nerve pathways is also important
The acid in the intestine stimulates pepsin (mediated by secretin)

What is the overall role of the gastric mucosal barrier::Maintain integrity of the gastric mucosa even in the presence of pH as low as 1

What are the important aspects of the gastric mucosal barrier
?
Gastric mucus secretion
Gastric bicarbonate secretion
Epithelial cell turnover (renewal) (very short life, about 3 days)
Gastric mucosal blood flow
Tight junctions between cells
Above increased by prostaglandins

What cells perform mucus secretion::Surface mucous cells (glycocalyx layer), and mucous neck cells

Outline the blood supply of the gastric mucosal barrier
?
An abundant blood supply removes rapidly any H+ that backflow to lamina propria
Buffering by bicarbonate secretion from mucous neck cells

Outline the role of tight junctions in the gastric mucosal barrier::Tight junctions between epithelial cells prevent access to toxins and bacteria

Outline the importance of cell renewal in the gastric mucosal barrier
?
Upward migration and replacement of surface mucus cells and mucus neck cells aids in the maintenance of the barrier; damaged or affected cells are rapidly removed from the epithelium
3-4 day lifespan

What are the types of drugs used to treat gastric ulceration
?
Drugs that suppress acid secretion
Cytoprotective drugs
Antacids

How can we suppress acid secretion
?
Histamine receptor blockers (H2 receptor antagonists)
- cimetidine, famotidine, ranitidine
- Important drug-drug interactions involving liver metabolism and cytochrome p450 enzyme (these interactions also occur with grapefruit juice and alcohol)
- Reduce acid secretion by up to 70%
Proton pump inhibitor prevents H+ release
- Omeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole
- Irreversibly block active transport of H+ ions
- Used for unresponsive gastric ulcer
- Are tending to replace histamine antagonists
- Can reduce acid secretion more than any other classes of drugs

What are the cytoprotective drugs used in the stomach
?
Prostaglandin analogues
- Misoprostol (PGE2)
- Increased mucous secretion, increased blood flow, increased cell turnover
- Decreased acid secretion
Sucralfate (Ulcer bandaid)
- Sucrose octosulfate and aluminium hydroxide
- Dissociates --> sticky adherent gel + neutralising agent

What are the antacids used in the stomach
?
Act to neutralise hydrocholoric acid, bind bile acids and decrease pepsin activity
Provide symptomatic relief
Generally contain AIOH, CaCO3, Mg(OH)2, NaHCO3
Mg --> Increased bowel motility
AL --> decreased bowel activity
Used only in human medicine
