# DS - P06 - Abdomen Dissection

Explain the differences in the configuration of the duodenal papillae between dogs and cats. For  
each species, state which ducts release secretions through each duodenal papilla.  
?
Dogs have two duodenal papillae: a major duodenal papilla and a minor duodenal papilla. The major duodenal papilla contains openings for both the common bile duct and pancreatic duct. The  
minor duodenal papilla contains the opening for the accessory pancreatic duct. 
In contrast, cats have only a single duodenal papilla, which contains the opening for both the common bile duct and pancreatic duct.
