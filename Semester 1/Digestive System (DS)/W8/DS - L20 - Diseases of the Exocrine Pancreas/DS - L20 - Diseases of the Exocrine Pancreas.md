# DS - L20 - Diseases of the Exocrine Pancreas

## Intended Learning Outcomes
- Explain the defence mechanisms that prevent pancreatic auto-digestion in health and the circumstances in which they can fail. 
- Recognise the clinical signs that may be indicative of exocrine pancreatic disease. 
- Explain the aetiopathogenesis and describe the associated lesions of the common disorders of the exocrine pancreas of domestic animals

What are the risk factors for acute pancreatic necrosis?
?
Hyperlipidemic conditions: Obesity, high fat, low protein diets, ingestion of a large fatty meal, idiopathic hyperlipidemia of miniature schnauzers, hyperadrenocorticism
Pancreatic hypoxia: Reduced oxygen levels leads to dysregulation of intracellular calcium stores. This can be induced by hypovolemia, hypotension, local vasoconstriction, disseminated intravascular coagulation, pancreatic trauma and abdominal trauma
Conditions causing systemic hypercalcemia: This also leads to increased intracellular calcium. Primary causes are renal failure and paraneoplastic hypercalcemia (lymphoma)
Drugs and toxins: Corticosteroids, azathioprine and scorpion envenomation

Outline the anatomy of the pancreas
?
Glandular tissue which runs along the mesenteric border of the proximal duodenum: Significant variation between species
The pancreatic duct drains into the duodenum, often immediately adjacent to the bile duct
The bile duct runs through the pancreas
Need to worry about concurrent bile duct damage in the pancreas

Outline the function of the exocrine pancreas
?
Food digestion in the duodenum via synthesis and secretion of digestive enzymes
- Protein - proteases
- Carbohydrates - amylase
- Dietary fat-lipase (in combination with bile salts)
Acinar cells

Outline pancreatic secretion
?
Initiation of pancreatic secretion
1. Sensory inputs (cephalic phase)
2. Entry of food to the stomach (gastric phase)
3. Movement of acid digesta into the duodenum (intestinal phase)
4. Nutrient absorption from the intestinal lumen (absorbed nutrient phase)
Regulation by entero-endocrine hormones from GI mucosa and the endocrine component of the pancreas

Outline the intestinal phase of pancreatic secretion
?
Entry of gastric acid and fatty acid into the duodenum
Release of secretin and cholecystokinin by mucosal endocrine cells
Secretion of water and bicarbonate by ductal epithelium and release of digestive enzymes from zymogen granules into ducts

Outline the role of acinar cell
?
Synthesise trypsin, chymotrypsin, collagenase, phospholipase elastases and carboxypeptides as inactive proenzymes in the cytoplasm
Synthesise amylase and lipase in their active forms which are present in the cytoplasm within membrane-bound zymogen granules (apical segment)

Outline the prevention of autodigestion of the pancreas
1. Enzymes stored as inactive proenzymes or within zymogen granules. **Requires cholecystokinin for release**
2. Sphincter at duct entrance prevents reflux
3. Trypsin activation requires enterokinase
  - Enterokinase secreted by the duodenal epithelium
  - Trypsin then activates other enzymes
4. Trypsin inhibitors in acinar cells and serum prevent accidental activation of enzymes. (Alpha 1 protease inhibitor and alpha 2 macroglobulins)

What are some of the consequences of pancreatic necrosis
?
Swelling and inflammation in the pancreas can affect surrounding tissues
- Occlusion of bile duct -> jaundice
- Hepatitis, enteritis, peritonitis
Pancreatic enzymes escape into the circulation
- Tissue autodigestive damage
- Fat necrosis (especially subcutaneous "Pancreatic panniculitis"
Systemic inflammatory response
- Thrombosis and poor tissue perfusion death
Secondary infections uncommon
Recurrence is common
Damage to islet cells and loss of exocrine cells
- Diabetes mellitus
- Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency
Large redundancy in pancreatic function, need to lose most of the tissue before EPI or diabetes

Outline chronic interstitial pancreatitis
?
Does have an acute phase
Develops as an extension of inflammation initially around pancreatic ducts
- Possible arises from ascending infection from the duodenum
- Ductular parasitism (flukes, Strongylus equinus)
The acute phase of the disease is neutrophilic
Scar tissue develops with pancreatic atrophy +/- compensatory nodular hyperplasia
Cats and horses - common biliary and pancreatic draining -> susceptible to the extension of cholangitis

What does serum trypsin-like immunoreactivity::with pancreatic insufficiency there is not enough trypsinogen produced which means very little leaks into the blood

What are some of the causes of pancreatic insufficiency?
?
Need to lose 95% of pancreas
Primary atrophy
- Starvation/Anorexia
  - Can be a deficiency in individual amino acids or trace elements (selenium/vitamin E)
  - Loss of hormonal and neurogenic stimulation + catabolism of cells compensate for the nutritional shortfall
  - Rapidly reversible
- Secondary atrophy
  - Ductular obstructive disease
    - Stenosis
    - Inflammatory stricture
    - Pancreatoliths (stones)
- Canine juvenile pancreatic atrophy
- Cats are most commonly associated with chronic subclinical pancreatitis

discuss canine juvenile pancreatic atrophy
?
Most cases in German shepherds
- Inherited condition
- Most cases have clinical signs by 6-12 months
Other breeds
- Rough-coated collies, English setters, greyhounds and beagles
Lymphocytic inflammation and acinar atrophy
- The pattern of inflammation suggests it is an autoimmune disease
Marked reduction in pancreatic tissue
- Some greyhounds also lose Islet cells

What secondary processes occur as a consequence of pancreatic insufficiency
?
Vitamins B12 (cobalamin), A D and E
Vitamin K - can develop clotting deficiencies
Secondary bacterial overgrowth
- Pancreatic enzymes suppress bacterial colonization
- The abundance of undigested nutrients for bacterial growth
- Change to luminal microenvironment -> atrophy of intestinal villi and dysbiosis (small intestinal bacterial overgrowth)

Outline ductular disease
?
Pancreatolithiasis
- Calculi found in pancreatic ducts
- Uncommon and rarely cause complete obstruction
Parasites
- Eurytrema flukes (exotic): Ruminants and sometimes people
- Sometimes other parasites (roundworms)
Effects: Periductular inflammation
- Severe pancreatic atrophy and periductular fibrosis if occluded

Discuss pancreatic nodular hyperplasia
?
Exocrine hyperplasia
- Older animals
- Often diffuse nodular change (pale nodules)
- Histologically cells well differentiated
Ductular hyperplasia
- Secondary to underlying pancreatic disease or aging change

What is pancreatic neoplasia
?
Adenomas
- Uncommon and incidental
- Susually a single nodule
- Exapnsile masses with compression of surrounding parenchyma and thin capsule
Adenocarcinoma
- Produce vague clinical signs and often not detected until late in the disease: Anorexia, vomiting, weight loss, lethargy
- Typically aggressive malignancies with local invasion +/- peritoneal seeding
- Metastasis to the liver common
- may induce other diseases
  - Pancreatic necrosis or exocrine insufficiency due to invasive behaviour
  - Pancreatic panniculitis
  - Pancreatic paraneoplastic alopecia
