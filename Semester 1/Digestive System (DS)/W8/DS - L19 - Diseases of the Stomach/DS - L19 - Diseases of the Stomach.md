- Outline the pathogeneses of common diseases of the stomach/abomasum in domestic animals.

## Diseases of the Stomach

Outline the gastric secretions in the stomach and abomasum::stomach pH 3 or less and in the abomasum 3.5-4 or less

Why is the restitution of the gastric mucosa important
?
Rapid migration of surface epithelium to cover a defect (within minutes)
The protective barrier formed by fibrin, mucous and exfoliated cells

What is the role of prostaglandins in the stomach::mucous and bicarb secretion, inhibition of histamine stimulated acid secretion, inducing proliferation of the mucous epithelium

What occurs first, inflammatory response or restitution of the stomach epithelium::Restitution

Outline the atrophy of specialised cells of the stomach mucosa
?
Chronic disease
replacement of parietal cells with more primitive cells
Not obvious grossly 
This can result in achlorhydria which is a loss of acid secretion leading

Outline mucous metaplasia and hyperplasia
?
Chronic disease
Stimulation of mucous neck cells + loss of parietal cells
This can result in achlorhydria with disruption of the microbiome

Outline pyloric stenosis
?
Functional or anatomic
Acquired or congenital
Clinically seen as delayed gastric emptying
Physical causes:
- Chronic ulceration
- granulation and stricture
- polyps
- tumours
- foreign bodies

Describe chronic hypertrophic pyloric gastropathy
?
Condition of dogs (more so small breed)
**Mucosal** or smooth muscle hypertrophy (or both)
Mucosal hypertrophy is more common
Pathogenesis poorly understood
Grossly appears as marked thickened mucosal folds obstructing the pylorus
To diagnose you need a full-thickness gastric biopsy. **A pinch biopsy will show only the mucosa and cannot diagnose**

Outline gastric impaction
?
Can occur in horses and cattle
Causes include:
- Feeding low-quality roughage, low water intake or poor mastication (dental disease)
- Pyloric obstruction e.g. due to hairballs (trichobezoar similar to those that occur in the rumen) and other foreign materials can also cause impaction
- Vagal nerve damage (due to pneumonia, pleuritis or lymphoma) -> abnormal gastric motility and emptying (vagal indigestion)
Grossly seen as distended stomach/abomasum with abundant dry ingesta
Dogs and cats more commonly obstruct foreign body

Outline gastric dilation dn rupture in horses
?
Dilation
Primary disease:
- Most commonly in horses fed with rapidly fermentable carbohydrates, on lush pasture, or with excessive water intake
- Ingesta swells due to increased gastric secretion and saliva
- Bacterial fermentation of the  carbohydrates produces as and lactic cid -> increased osmotic pressure and thus an influx of water
- Consequently, there is further distension systemic and dehydration which ca result in. shock and death
- Can develop laminitis
Secondary disease
- Mostly seen associated with physical obstruction of the stomach or intestine or colic with ileum
Animals that survive can develop laminitis 
Rupture:
- occurs in primary or secondary disease or in some cases can be idiopathic 
- Peritonitis develops rapidly due to the release of gastric content into the abdominal cavity
- On post-mortem examination, free ingesta is found in the abdominal cavity and the gastric wall is lacerated
- **Gastric rupture can also occur post-mortem, if too neat it is likely to post mortem**

Describe dilation and volvulus in dogs 
?
Predisposing factors include:
- Laxity of the hepatosplenic ligament
- Prior splenectomy
- Diet of small food particles
- Recent kennelling
- Infection with nasal mites inducing reverse sneezing
Condition is associated with overeating or eating large meals once daily
Distension of the stomach by food and fluid is compound by gas accumulation, possibly from aerophagia
Caused by clockwise rotation to the right of the stomach when viewed ventral dorsal,
Rotation is 180-360
Spleen follows the gastric splenic ligament

Outline the consequences of GDV in dogs
?
Torsion causes constriction of venous outflow and infarction occurs 
Grossly the stomach wall is oedematous and dark red to black
Mucosa becomes necrotic and may rupture
Obstructed veins and pressure from the distended stomach on the portal vein and vena cava -> increased venous return from the heart, reduced cardiac output and circulatory shock
Increased intrabdominal pressure impinges on the diaphragm -> respiratory compromise
Variety of acid-base and electrolyte abnormalities +/- DIC
Decreased portal vein flow can cause pancreatic ischemia and, with myocardial necrosis -> release of myocardial depressant factors -> causes arrhythmias

Outline abomasal displacement in ruminants
?
Most commonly high producing intensively managed dairy cows
In most cases left sided displacement - 15% right-sided displacement (clinically more serious)
Displacement leads to partial disruption of abomasal outflow
Chloride sequestered in the abomasum and metabolic alkalosis develops
**Left-sided abomasal displacement (LDA)**:
- Generally non-fatal
- Develops during the 6 weeks following parturition 0 abomasal atony can occur as a result of heavy grain feeding and hypocalcaemia
- Many affected animals have concurrent problems, including ketosis, hypocalcaemia, metritis, and retained placenta

Outline the term gastritis
?
A broad term used that reflects a wide variety of insults on the stomach
Acute gastritis
- Grossly: mucosal sloughing, ulceration, oedema, haemorrhage, hyperaemia, excess mucus
- Clinical signs = vomiting, anterior abdominal pain, salivation, +/- diarrhoea
Chronic gastritis
- Nodular, irregular and thickened rugal folds +/- abscesses or ganulomas
- Mucosal changes including atrophy of specialized cells (parietal and chief cells) and mucous cell hyperplasia
- Achlorhydria can develop
- In dogs, horses and pigs, chronic gastritis may lead to a condition known as **hypertrophic gastritis**
- Causes include gastric parasitism, lymphocytic-plasmacytic gastritis, and food allergy

Describe Braxy
?
*Clostridium septicum* infection (gram-positive bacilli)
Acute asbomasitis in sheep and less commonly cattle
The cause is poorly understood: Generally occurs in cold weather and is thought to arise from mechanical trauma to the mucosa
Bacterial exotoxin production -> death due to toxaemia: Toxins causes severe tissue damage, increase capillary permeability and tissue necrosis
Grossly: mucosal and submucosal oedema and haemorrhage, gas formation by the bacteria (fermentation) -> submucosal emphysema

Outline viral abomasitis
?
Viral gastritis is uncommon in dogs and cats
Abomasitis rarely the sol lesions
Examples:
- Infection bovine rhinotracheitis in calves (rarely, older animals)
- Herpes viral infections of small ruminants
- Bovine viral diarrhoea
- Malignant catarrhal fever
- Bluetongue

Describe mycotic gastritis/abomasitis
?
Typically secondary disease with underlying achlorhydria, atrophy, necrosis or ulceration
Can also be compromised resistance
- Endotoxemia, septicemia
- Endogenous or exogenous steroids
- Neoplasia
- Viral disease
- Altered gastrointestinal flora caused by antibiotic therapy
Commonly zygomycetes (Phycomycetes)
Fungal hyphae infiltrate the submucosa - invade venules and arterioles, causing thrombosis and hemorrhagic infarction
Grossly: mucosal necrosis with surface haemorrhage and haemorrhage and oedema in the submucosa

Outline chemical injury
?
Causes acute gastritis
Grossly: diffuse gastric congestion, haemorrhage, necrosis, ulceration, oedema
Causes include:
- Arsenic
- Phosphatic fertilisers
- Various plants
- heavy metals
- Dishwashing powder
- Metaldehyde
- Blister beetles/cantharidin toxicity (horses)

How do NSAIDs cause stomach issues
?
Inhibit COX 1 and COX 2 pathways which prevent prostaglandins from working correctly and lead to gastric ulceration, reduced bicarb, reduced blood flow, reduced epithelial cell renewal, increased oxygen species, 
NSAIDs are also acidic

Outline lymphoplasmacytic gastritis
?
Common diagnosis in dogs and cats
Believed to arise as an idiopathic reaction to a range of intraluminal antigens, food and/or bacterial allergens often implicated
Currently no direct association with infection by Helicobacter in domestic animals

Outline uremia
?
Occasionally seen in dogs, cats and horses due to renal failure
Found in wildlife (including birds)
Grossly: red-black discolouration of the mucosa (congestion) with associated haematemesis and melena. mineral deposition may be seen if severe enough
Histologically: mineral deposition in the basement membranes of vessels, glands and smooth muscle
Mineral deposition associated with calcium imbalance
Uraemic toxins also cause vascular endothelial damage -> oedema, thrombosis and mucosal ischemic damage

Outline the role of helicobacter
?
Spirochete bacteria
The most common cause of gastritis and ulceration in humans (Also considered a risk factor for the development of gastric neoplasia) **IN HUMANS**
In dogs and cats: heilmannii, cania, felis
The role of Helicobacter in gastric disease in domestic animals is not proven
Described pathology ranges from the presence of the organism in the absence of noticeable mucosal injury to severe gastric disease: Differences in gastric pathology may be influenced by helicobacter species and strain and mammalian host or may indicate. a lack of causation of helicobacter lesions
One exception is the ferret where H. mustelae has been shown to be causal of lymphoplasmacytic gastritis
Gastritis in cheetahs has been associated with helicobacter infection

Outline the different types of ulcers
?
Erosion = only mucosa
Acute ulcer = submucosa
Chronic = muscularis with scarring
Perforating = all the way through

Outline ulceration
?
Acute or chronic
- Acute ulcers are hyperaemic (redness)
- Chronic ulcers lack redness - have a thickened, firm rim of fibrosis
The primary underlying mechanism is the impairment of mucosal integrity with normal acid secretion
This imbalance can be a result of the following:
- Local disturbance of trauma to the epithelium (Back flush of bile acids from the duodenum, Mechanical trauma (foreign bodies, etc.))
- High gastric acidity
- Gastrinomas (Zolinger-Ellison syndrome) or mast cell tumours (histamine release) can lead to gastric acid hypersecretion
- Local disturbances in blood flow resulting in ischemia
- Stress
- NSAIDs or endogenous or exogenous steroids
Perforation of gastric ulcers results in massive abdominal haemorrhage and/or release of gastric acid into the abdomen and a fatal peritonitis

Outline equine gastric ulcers
?
Acute = red + sharp edges
Equine gastric ulcer syndrome (EGUS) is used to describe this disease
2 main disease subsets:
- **Foals** commonly ulceration in the squamous portion but can develop in the glandular portion with NSAIDs
- **Adult** horses also commonly have ulceration in the squamous portion of the stomach
  - Gastric ulcers occur in 40% to 90% of competitive and performance horses, especially thoroughbreds
  - The most severe ulcers occur in those animals that are worked the hardest
Proposed causes of ulceration of the non-glandular mucosa include:
- Fasting: Hay and saliva protect the gastric mucosa
- Intense exercise: Increased abdominal pressure leads to prolonged exposure of the non-glandular mucosa to acid. Exercise can have an inhibiting effect on gastric emptying

Outline porcine gastric ulcers
?
Weaners and growers are more susceptible
The disease is associated with stress and diet formulation (finely ground grain)
other associations include slatted flooring and high-carbohydrate foods
In pigs, the typical preceding lesions in the gastric mucosa is hyperkeratosis of the pars oesophagea, which then erodes and an ulcer develops
Acute haemorrhage can result in severe acute blood loss and death. These pale, anaemic pigs are sometimes described as porcelain pigs

Outline bovine abomasal ulcers
?
Abomasal ulcers common in cattle
Calves associated with:
- Dietary changes and mechanical irritation of the abomasum with roughage
- Stress also is contributing factor
Adult dairy cattle associated with:
- Heavy grain feeding (lactic acidosis) at the time of parturition
- Displacement of the abomasum
- Viral infection (BVD, pestivirus), malignant catarrhal fever (herpesvirus)
- Impaction
Grossly:
- Present as linear brown, black, hemorrhagic areas along margins of the rugae
- Primarily in pylorus
- Can measure up to 15 cm in diameter
Ulcers should be considered where there is anaemic and/or melena, and perforation and suspected are signs of septic peritonitis

Outline canine gastric ulceration
?
Clinically associated with variable appetite, abdominal pain, vomition, melena and anaemia
Usually found in the pyloric antrum and proximal duodenum
Causes include:
- Dermal mast cell tumours: release histamine into the bloodstream which binds to receptors on parietal cells increasing HCl secretion
- Gastrinomas (pancreas or duodenum): secretion of gastrin increases secretion of HCl (Zollinger-Ellison)
- NSAIDs
- Trauma
- Physical loss of epithelium
- Uraemia

Gastric/abomasal parasitism is a common problem in dogs and cats::False

What is *Haemonchus contortus / H. placei*
?
Large abomasal blood-sucking nematode parasites
Cause severe anaemia and hypoproteinaemia
Egg hatch in pasture and moult 3 times to L3 larvae -> infectious
Larvae survive for some time on pasture, particularly in cool conditions
Parasites have high fecundity, a short life cycle and a high degree of genetic variation: rapid adaptive changes and develop resistance to drenches
In cold weather, larvae undergo hypobiosis (arrested development) and resume developing once conditions are warmer
Engorged females have a barbers pole appearance with the red blood in their intestinal tract wrapping around their white genital tract
Gross lesions are of serve oedema (bottle jaw) and pallor from anaemia

Outline Ostertagia in stomach issues
?
Cattle: Ostertagia and otertagi and O. lyrate
Sheep and goats: teladorsagia circumcinta
Causes protein loss with diarrhoea
Direct lifecycle
- 3rd stage larva (l3) ingested and invade abomasal glands
- **Type 1** ostertagiasis -> direct development to L5 leading to disease
- **Type 2** ostertagiasis -> hypobiosis of L4 in glands
- Larvae damage mucosa -> inflammation and mucous neck cell hyperplasia and metaplasia
Adults live on the mucosal surface
Gross changes: markedly thickened mucosa with raised, pale nodular lesions with a slightly depressed centre (larval stages in glands). Merging nodules described as Moroccan leather

Outline the pathogenesis due to ostertagia
?
Diarrhoea
1. Parietal cells replaced by mucous neck cells (mucous cell metaplasia) 
2. Decreased HCl secretion (**achlorhydria**)
3. Increased abomasal pH (up to 7 or more)
4. Pepsinogen not converted to pepsin (due to increased pH)
5. Decreased protein digestion (**hypoproteinaemia**)
6. Bacterial overgrowth in the intestine
7. Diarrhoea
Decreased appetite
1. Blood gastrin increases as the body tries to stimulate acid secretion (**Hypergastrinemia**)
2. Central effect on satiety centre and decreased GI motility
3. Decreased appetite
Protein loss
1. Gastritis
2. Increased vascular permeability
3. Leaky junctions between hyperplastic mucous cells
4. Protein loss into the abomasum
Clinically: loss of appetite; diarrhoea, wasting
Clinically pathology: hypoproteinaemia; achlorhydria, increased plasma pepsinogen

Outline Trichostrongylus axei
?
Occurs in ruminants and horses
Direct lifecycle
Parasites live in intra-epithelial tunnels in mucosa -> mucous metaplasia and hyperplasia of glands with subsequent protein loss and achlorhydria
Grossly the stomach is thickened with nodules or folds of mucosa + erosions and it is covered in thick mucus

What are the gastric parasites of horses?
?
Draschia megastoma: Burrows into submucosa along margo plicatus forming large nodules or pouches of granulomatous inflammation containing worms
Habronema majus, H. muscae: parasites on mucosal surface
Gasterophilus (Fly larvae or bots): very common, flies lay eggs on hairs that are licked by the horse and they hatch and develop into larvae in the stomach. The parasites may cause small erosions and ulcers but infection is generally asymptomatic
Trichostrongylus axei - see above

Outline the gastric parasites of pigs
?
Hyostrongylus rubidus
Clinical signs are usually absent in light infections but heavy infections can lead to decreased appetite, weight loss and anaemia
Infections are primarily confined to animals reared outdoors
Larval hypobiosis can occur

Outline gastric neoplasia
?
**Adenocarcinoma**
- Most common in dogs: about 10 years of age
- > 50% of adenocarcinomas occur in the pyloric region
  - Grossly they are variable
    - proliferative and protrude into the lumen
    - Large, ulcerated crater
    - Localised, plaque-like thickening
- Most incite a scirrhous reaction
- High metastatic potential
  - Nodal metastases report in 70% of dogs at diagnosis
  - Distant metastases are observed in 15-70% of dogs at diagnosis with metastases most common in the liver, spleen, lungs and adrenal glands
**Squamous cell carcinomas**
- Most commonly occur in middle-aged horses
- Squamous portion of the stomach
- Grossly these tumours appear as cauliflower-like masses projecting from the mucosal surface
- equine gastric SCCs can cause hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia, most likely due to paraneoplastic production of PTH-rp
- If they extend through the serosal surface they can seed throughout the peritoneal cavity
- Can also spread directly to the liver, spleen, and diaphragm, and can metastasise to live and lung
**Lymphoma**
- Occurs most commonly in cats, cattle and dogs
- Cattle the abomasum is a common site for lymphoma associated with enzootic bovine leukosis
- Grossly the neoplastic cell infiltrates can develop as a diffuse thickening however some cases appear more nodular
- Both T and B lymphocyte variants occur
**Spindle cell tumour**
- Spindle cell tumours arise from the wall
- Either leiomyomas/sarcomas (smooth muscle origin) or gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs) (arise from the interstitial cells of Cajal)
- Can only be differentiated on immunohistochemistry
- Grossly are firm, pale masses within the wall
- Both gastric leiomyosarcomas and GISTs have been reported to metastasise
**Neuroendocrine tumours** (gastric carcinoid)
- Derived from enteroendocrine cells
- relatively rare and more likely to develop in proximal parts of the stomach
- While function tumours exist in humans, none have been described in domesticated
- Most are well differentiated and locally expansile, metastasis has been described in dogs and cats
