# DS - L21 - Diseases of the Peritoneal Cavity

## Intended Learning Outcomes
- Discuss the routes by which peritoneal fluid drains in health and explain the mechanisms that can be responsible for the accumulation of excess fluid within the cavity 
- Describe the common disease processes that affect the peritoneal cavity and retroperitoneum of domestic animals and outline their causes and potential consequences
- Identify the characteristic gross and/or microscopic lesions that are used to reach a specific diagnosis.

## Diseases of the Peritoneal Cavity

What is the mesothelial layers::Single continuous layer of mesodermal in origin, which will glisten due to peritoneal fluid. 

What is the fluid in the peritoneal cavity::Constantly changing, only a few millilitres, drained into cardiovascular

How does the fluid exit the peritoneal cavity::some will exit via the capillary walls, there is a large lymphatic plexus on the right-hand side which also drains back into the cardiovascular system

Outline the actions of mesothelial cells::can grow, can undergo mitotic division, can phagocytose, can produce a plasminogen activator which converts plasminogen to plasmin which can enzymatically break down fibrin, in health also produce a polysaccharide lubricant into the peritoneal fluid allowing layers to rub without friction

Outline how fragile mesothelial cells are::Very sensitive and can just slough off. Fingers during a laparotomy can cause it

What are the consequences of bacterial infection of the mesothelial cells::lose a lot of cells, less plasminogen activator, mast cells underneath degranulating increasing vascular permeability, allows fibrinogen into the cavity which becomes sticky fibrin, chemotaxis of leukocytes (mainly neutrophils) into the lumen. This leads to surfaces sticking together. Want to remove the exudate before the layers fuse

What can digest sticky fibrin?
?
Plasmin can in the short term
Macrophages
If the exudate remains for 4-5 days there will be the formation of granulation tissue

Outline the role of scar tissue and its consequences in the peritoneal cavity::good for walling off but can form permanent adhesions. If it is only bound to one end it is just a fibrous tag. Coarse dense, adhesions can cause organ dysfunction

Outline post-mortem decomposition in the peritoneal cavity
?
Blood-stained watery fluid (serous-sanguineous fluid), which is a seepage of fluid out of capillaries
This fluid has lysed red blood cells which give everything a pink tinge
Near the gall bladder, there will be yellowish discourage
Gas bubbles in the serosa and the mesenteries

Describe the displacement of visceral components in the peritoneal cavity
?
The components have shifted position
In horses, left dorsal displacement of the large colon, large colon stuck between the spleen and left kidney

Describe the process of herniation 
?
Something is moving through a hole (hernial ring)
Visceral displacement usually occurs before
Can be a natural or acquired hole
Internal if it is within the cavity and external if it leaves the cavity
Through a natural hole: epiploic foramen in adult horses, between the peritoneal cavity and omental bursa, in some animals small intestine and mesentery can feed through that hole into the omental bursa. This hernia can then experience external pressure which cuts off blood supply to the segment of the small intestine
Most hernias are from acquired holes

Outline external herniation
?
It exists outside the abdominal cavity
Coughing fits after a laparotomy, pregnancy
In umbilical hernias, the umbilical ring doesn't close properly, usually a large defect in the abdominal cavity. Most of the time it isn't compromised but can be quite large
Inguinal hernias. If it tears you can get a fibrin connection, direct when it has exited the canal and indirect when it is still in the canal
Scrotal hernias can cause fertility issues as the testes are too hot

Outline perineal hernias
?
Ventral to the tail, near the external anal orifice
Tearing between coccygeus muscle and cranial aspect of the anal sphincter
Adipose tissue can move through that herniation

Outline diaphragmatic hernia
?
A tear in the diaphragm
Normally acquired
Could be clinically silent
Congenital defects can also lead to this hernia

Describe the consequences of abdominal trauma
?
Can bring in foreign materials and bacteria
Blunt trauma can cause septic peritonitis
Internal bleeding
Bruising
Hypovolemic shock, rupture of organs
Rupture hollow organs
In pregnant animals, you can rupture the pregnant uterus

T/F You should never find ingesta in the peritoneal cavity of a healthy animal::True

How do you tell if a rupture is pre or post mortem
?
Post-mortem ruptures are localized
Pre mortem will have a host response (hyperemia, fibrinosuprative exudate)

Outline the parasites in the peritoneal cavity
?
Never normal
Some worms are going from place to place, kidney worms in pigs
Horse scar tissue plaques from worms
Not because of gut rupture
Tapeworm doesn't bug sheep but can affect dogs

Outline blood in the peritoneal cavity
?
Never normal
The first thing is trauma is likely
coagulopathy because of rodenticide
Fatty livers, amyloid livers, rupture without external trauma
Nangeoscarcoma 

Outline ascites
?
excess non-inflammatory fluid
The more fluid accumulates the more uncomfortable the animal is 
Disturbance in starling's force across capillary beds
Sometimes due to increased vascular permeability
Sometimes clear or yellow or red

Outline abdominocentesis
?
Estimated number of nuclear cells
Deciding if peritonitis exudate (high protein, high cell count) or ascites (low protein, low cell count)

What are some mechanisms of ascites?
?
Squamous cell carcinoma in the stomach (low protein ascites)
Increase in venous hydrostatic pressure (right-sided congestive heart failure) (modified high protein transudate)
Liver cirrhosis increases pressure portal vein pressure, leading to portal hypertension which means capillary bed pressure increases and this means more water is being expelled (low protein ascites)
Hypoalbuminemia causes the oozing of fluid leading to ascites

Describe peritonitis
?
Inflammation of the peritoneal cavity
Part of inflammatory processes, high nucleated cells due to leukocyte chemotaxis
Chemical peritonitis:
- Talc during laparotomy leads to low-grade peritonitis
- Antibiotics can cause it
- Berrium if it leaks into the peritoneal cavity can be potentially lethal peritonitis
- Chile (fat-rich) due to rupture of lymphatic buildup in the stomach cause low-grade peritonitis
- The greenish discolouration will produce a green fluid that contains bile salts and these bile salts will begin to digest forming a septic peritonitis
- Urinary tract lever seeping urine into the abdomen causing peritonitis
Viral Peritonitis
- Cats have enteric coronavirus (can have mutatant strain) feline infectious peritonitis

Outline wet feline infectious peritonitis
?
Macrophages forming in and around vessel walls, antigen complexes form, complement cascade, and seepage through increased permeability
High protein modififed transudate or exudate

Outline dry feline infectious peritonitis
?
Pyogranulomas on antigen-antibody complexes

Outline bacterial (septic) peritonitis
?
Bacteria from external
hematogenous entry
Typically from the gastrointestinal tract, rupture or devitalization
hypermotility at the start
Sympathetic systems cause paralysis, and paralytic ileus (fibrinous connections can form, and amotily cut builds up gas and things)
Prognosis is poor (except in cows due to large omentum which can localise infection)

Outline fat necrosis
?
The active phase is a hyperemic region that highlights affected areas
Bright white areas are multifocal areas of fat necrosis
Normally doesn't matter
The yellow fat disease is due to lipofuscin build-up due to a lack of scavenging molecules to mop up free radicals (not in ruminants but more so in cats)
Massive fat necrosis in cattle is mostly incidental but in strategic locations, it can compress and be significance

Outline peritoneal neoplasia
?
Lipoma: benign tumour, in horses (they tend to arise from adipocytes in the mesentery which have a long stalk that can get coiled around the mesentery or intestines)
Mesothelioma: malignant tumour of mesothelial cells (peritoneal cavity), spread via implementation on the serosal surface. Can be many pleural cavities or just one. Neonatal calves and dogs, typically require euthanasia
Mesothelioma, Peritoneal carcinomatosis, and Chronic granulomatous peritonitis all require microscopy to distinguish
Carcinoma: is epithelial in origin

Outline sarcomas
?
Sarcomas metastasis via blood vessels or lymphatics
Origin is the connective or mesenchymal origin
haemangiosarcoma is common in dogs and comes from the spleen and implants elsewhere

Describe the retroperitoneum
?
Outside the primary peritoneal cavity
Kidneys and adrenal glands are retroperitoneal
Adipose tissue is stored in the retroperitoneum
Most voluminous dorsally
Continuous with retro pleura and retropelvic
Pus can accumulate in retroperitoneum
Oedema fluid can accumulate
Haemorrhage / hematoma can accumulate (trauma, fractured vertebra)
Tumours
