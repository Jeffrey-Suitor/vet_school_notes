# DS - L28 - When the Gut Stops Moving

Outline how the location of small intestine obstruction impacts the presentation
?
May share the pain, lethargic, off food
More dramatic per acute presentation is most often proximal obstructions (mid-small intestine, jejunum, proximal to that)
Large intestinal and distal small intestinal obstructions, more insidious, milder clinical signs, 
Accumulation of content in both cases
Distension is more pronounced when more proximal
More proximal you can get vomiting or reflux
In more proximal more likely to have alkalosis, potassium loss, chloride loss, retained bile secretions and salivary secretions

What are the causes of intestinal obstructions?
?
Extrinsic obstruction: something outside is pressing on the bowel
Luminal obstruction: something is inside the lumen blocking
Vascular accidents (hypoxia/infarction)
Stenosis: increase of wall thickness causing narrowing
Functional obstruction: problem with peristalsis

Outline the congenital causes of intestinal obstructions
?
Segmental aplasia
- Stenosis
- Atresia
Believed to be caused by ischemic injury during development
Calves are most likely to have particularly Friesian and Holstein and particularly in the spiral colon

What are the clinical signs of atresia ani
?
Distension of colon
Worsening colic
Distension of more proximal levels
Want to recognize early so you can euthanise

Outline colonic aganglionosis
?
Absence of ganglia in myenteric plexus of the bowel
Colon, caecum
Albino foals born to frame overo parents
Autosomal recessive disease
Albino because melanoblasts are derived from the same neural crest cells as the missing ganglia and so they don't have melanoblasts
No peristalsis
Recognise and euthanise immediately
Similar issue in the distal intestine in pigs
Clydesdale foals a similar issue but not as bad as you still have some so more hypoplasia

Outline extrinsic obstruction of the intestinal
?
Anything that occupies space, mass, tumour, granuloma, massive fat necrosis
Displaced bowel (left dorsal displacement of left colon in horses), press on my spleen, stomach, etc
Hernial rings impair or prevent vascular outflow, pressing on herniated loops of the small intestine (Diaphragmatic, umbilical, inguinal)
Rectal prolapse, everted distal end of the rectum to the outside, 
- extrinsic compression from the anal sphincter, usually preceded by straining in urination, defecation, or pregnancy. 
- Can be a herd outbreak in pigs if the feed is contaminated with fungus, fungus causes female pigs to strain and leads to rectal or vaginal prolapse
- Sheep on oestrogenic pastures can also have rectal prolapse
- Severe coughing bouts can lead to rectal prolapse

Outline luminal obstruction
?
Ingesta, dry food
- Check dentition
- Check water access
- Ask about recent nutritional changes
Sand + gravel
Acorns, leaves, etc.
The distal blockage is typically faeces
- Megacolon due to dry, retained faeces
- Retained faeces is referred to as constipation
- When faeces are impacted and not moving we refer to it as obstipation
- Try to find the cause 
  - In the male dog, is there an expanded prostate
  - Dogs and cats may be a spinal cord issue (slipped disk)
Bezoars can be found in intestines but are incidental findings unless they are causing mucosal abrasion, pressure necrosis, or blocking the lumen
Enteroliths are bezoars that have become mineralised
- Can be very heavy leading to pressure necrosis
- Go back and talk to the owner because food may have a lot of minerals or water may be alkaline
Parasites can impair movement, impaction leads to wall thinning, vascular compromise, and the septic peritonitis

Outline foreign bodies in animals
?
Foreign bodies mainly in dogs and cats
corn cobs are common
Sharp foreign bodies can be like hardware disease and can cause sepsis
Long foreign bodies (cat string toys), stockings, fish lines
- If one end is caught and the other continues distally, leading to placation/puckering of intestines, the string can cut through

Outline intestinal hypoxia and infarction
?
Normally venous outflow is impacted because it only has a single outflow
Congestion -> Oedema -> Critical hypoxia leads to intestinal infarction
Recognise and act quickly or it will kill
Bowel strangulation, bowel torsion, mesentery torsion
Pedunculated lipomas especially in horses can wrap around mesentery
Shock and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)
But in horses, right dorsal colon can have ulcers, some think direct effects, some secondary effects

In dogs and horses which mucosa is most vulnerable::small intestinal mucosa

T/F When you lose villi in the small intestine you can always regrow it to full strength::False, you can regrow but never to the full surface area

Outline intestinal caecal torsion
?
360-degree twists in mostly horses and cows
If the feed change is too sudden leads to too many VFAs leading to twisting
Around own long axis

Outline large colonic volvulus
?
Twist around the mesentery
180-degree twists

Outline intestinal volvulus = mesenteric torsion
?
Twisting of the axis of the dorsal mesentery
Animals that eat a meal too fast containing too much gas lead to twisting
In dogs pancreatic insufficiency leads to food buildup and predisposes to volvulus

Outline intussusception
?
Telescoping of intestinal segment distally into receiving segment
Variety of predisposing causes including
- Inflammation
- Parasites
- Tumours
- Foreign bodies
- Idiopathic
Often younger animals
Limited by tension on mesenteries (can be up to 12 cm in small animals, 30cm in large animals)

Outline causes of arterial infarction
?
Rare because there are many branches of arteries
Major branches have to be plugged
A lot less common today because of better parasite control
- Large strongyles volgarus enter the dorsal aorta and then will cause irritation and can cause thromboembolism which can block other major branches
- Major bacteriemia in sheep can do damage to and release thromboembolism leading to blockage of major branches

How can blockage of the liver lead to intestinal hypoxia?
?
Portal vein blockage, critical congestion
In Cirrhosis of the end-stage liver, the portal vein has a resistance that can lead to increases pressure -> portal hypertension -> impairs the function of draining organs -> hypoxia although normally more soggy and oedematous intestine

Outline stenosis of the intestine
?
Narrowing (stricture) is normally associated with wall thickening but if congenital then it won't have thickening
Post-ulcerative fibrosis, as scar tissue forms leads to contracture, proximal bit becomes dilated
In pigs rectal stricture caused by salmonella
Hypertrophy of the muscular layer of the small intestine
- Often idiopathic, could be caused by something
- Chronic ulcers associated with ileocaecal valve tapeworms
- Sacular outpouchings (diverticulosis), food and bacterial pockets -> septic peritonitis

Outline neoplasia of the intestines
?
Not very common
Intestinal adenomas (polyps), derived from epithelium, a distal large bowl of older dogs, can become malignant
Lymphoma is very common
Multiple small intestinal hyperplastic polyps can be due to coccidia infestation
In sheep, adenocarcinomas are common because of the presence of bracken fern which is a carcinogen, that can implant, metastasis
Plasma cell tumours can catch early and removal is curative
Intestinal carcinoid tumours
Intestinal mesenchymal tumours
- Leiomyoma and leiomyosarcoma
- Fibromas and fibrosarcomas
- Stromal tumours, interstitial cells are often malignant, paraneoplastic syndromes

Outline intestinal lymphoma
?
Very common in dogs and primarily cats
Can be a nodular type thicking or may just be a diffuse thickening, in dogs and horses it is associated with protein leakage into the lumen
Can be T or B cells
Can be just GI cells or can be in many different sites

Outline functional obstruction
?
Slipped disc
Paralytic ileus (small or large or stomach or a combination)
- Loops just look flaccid
- No audible gut sounds
- Always happens after surgery
- Animals that have peritonitis, renal failure, toxicity, shock, tetanus
- All are mediated by the sympathetic nervous system
- The longer it lasts the worse it gets

Outline dysautonomia 
?
Grass sickness (equine dysautonomia)
- Could be low-grade chronic colic
- Loss of peristaltic waves
- Gastric reflux -> fluid loss -> shock
- The large intestine can be impacted by large feed
- Might be caused by bacteria
Feline dysautonomia (Key-Gaskell syndrome)
- No one really knows
- Loss of peristalsis
- Could be autonomic ganglia lesions
- Could have many presentations
