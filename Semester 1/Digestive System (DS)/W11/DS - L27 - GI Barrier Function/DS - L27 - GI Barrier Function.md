- Describe the processes that govern drug absorption from the gastrointestinal tract and the physiological and pathological factors that may limit drug absorption.

## The GI Barrier

Outline the structural aspects of the mucosal barrier
?
Not much
Epithelial cells and the tight junctions that hold them together
Pathogens reach the epithelium and disrupt tight junctions. This exposes the vulnerable lateral membranes that are not protected by glycocalyx, allowing the pathogen to access underlying tissues and promoting diarrhoea

Outline the structure and composition of the brush border
?
Microvilli are set on a complex "terminal web"
Within each microvillus are up to 20 actin filaments, giving strength to the microvillus
Contractile forces generated by actin-myosin complexes contribute to microvillus shape
Control of microvillus length is poorly understood but is known to be altered by microbes

Outline the structural aspects of the mucosal barriers
?
Once toxins cross the epithelial later they have relatively unimpeded access to the circulation
Permeability of epithelial to different ions differs e.g. parietal cells are more acid resistant than intestinal cells
Changes in pH therefore can lead to cell damage

Outline the secretion GI barrier
?
Role of mucous
- Mucus is secreted throughout the GI tract
- Its role is not purely for lubrication

Outline the secreted surfacer mucous barrier
**A gell that coats the mucosal surface**
Secreted mucus forms two layers
- Inner layer: sterile and difficult to dislodge - thickest in stomach
- Outer layer: non-sterile and can be removed. Thicket in regions with the greatest bacterial count
- Inner layer: Thickest in the stomach, smallest in the small intestine
- Outer layer:
  - Stomach few bacteria
  - Small intestine 10^5 - 10^7 bacteria per gram chyme
  - Large intestine 10^10 - 10^12 bacteria per gram chyme

Outline the secreted surface mucous barrier
?
Components of the mucus barrier
- Secreted mucins (gell-forming glycoproteins)
- nonspecific antimicrobials (from Paneth cells)
- Immunoglobulins
Mucins secreted by
- Goblet cells in SI and LI
- Surface mucous cells in the stomach
- Mucous neck cells in the stomach
Mucins are glycoproteins that are heavily glycosylated (with a range of oligosaccharides, that form binding sites for bacteria)
Mucus gel forms a matrix for the retention of antimicrobial molecules and immunoglobulins secreted by cells in the lamina propria

Outline cell surface mucins
?
The transmembrane spans the cell membrane
Cytoplasmic domains involved in cell signalling
Extracellular domains are long filamentous glycoproteins (sometimes longer than the microvilli)
Can be shed from the cell surface in response to bacterial contact
An extracellular zone on the apical surface of mucosal epithelial cells that is comprised of carbohydrate-rich **transmembrane** and **secreted** molecules, including cell surface mucin glycoproteins

Describe the response at the cell surface to enteric pathogens
?
Secretion of stored mucus from goblet cells
Engagement of pathogen with cell surface mucin stimulates intracellular signalling through the cytoplasmic domain
If a pathogen binds to mucin, the extracellular domain of the mucin is shed, releasing the pathogen from the cell surface
Bacteria that do not bind may be excluded by steric hindrance (charge differences)

Outline how pathogens strategies to subvert the mucus barrier
?
Penetration of mucus layer:
- By enzymatic degradation
- By motility (flagella)
Avoidance of mucus layer (entering through cells not protected by mucus)
Alteration to hose cell
- Toxins that damage tight junctions
- Toxins that suppress mucus production

Outline the dynamics of the mucin barrier
?
**The mucus layer is not a static barrier**
Its constituents and their release are modulated by:
- The luminal environment (microbial population, bile salts)
- Neural factors (cholinergic stimuli)
- Endocrine factors (vasoactive intestinal peptide VIP, prostaglandins, nitric oxide)
- Immune factors (cytokines)
Rapid secretion of mucous can result in a 100-1000 fold increase in mucous volume after it is hydrated

Outline the role of the mucosal immune system (MALT - mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue)
?
**Role of Peyer's patches in SI**
- Collection of lymphocytes in SI
- M cells on epithelium overlying Peyer's patches present commensal microbial antigens to underlying immune cells
- This results in secretion of immunoglobulin into the gut
- Peyer's patches - organised collection of lymphoid tissue directly under epithelium - more common small intestine
- Found predominantly in the ileum and at the ileocaecal junction
- Predominantly B cell aggregates

Where does cell renewal happen in the gut?
?
The neck region of the gastric gland where cells move up and down and differentiate
In crypt cells, the stem cells are at the base, move up becoming secretory cells and then up the villus before being shed

Outline cell renewal and the mucosal barrier
?
Constant turnover of cells ensures the integrity of tight junctions and the efficiency of mucus secretion
cells migrating up the villus replace those lost from the villus tip

Outline cell turnover and the mucosal barrier
?
Stomach:
- Surface mucous cells 3-4 days
- Parietal cells 100 days
Small intestinal epithelial cell: 3-4 days
Large intestinal epithelial cell: 5-7 days
All are differentiated from progenitors cells-derived from single stem cell type

Outline the consequences of parvovirus
?
Radio-like virus - radiomimetic
Attacks DNA of rapidly dividing cells
The appearance of blood in SI with loss of villi and surface erosion
This leads to the destruction of dividing cells in crypts of the small intestine
Loss of villi --> loss of absorptive surface
Erosion of mucosa --> exposure of lamina propria and haemorrhage

**Why does gastric ulceration occur following severe systemic blood loss**
?
An abundant blood supply removes rapidly any H+ that backflows to lamina propria
Buffering by bicarbonate secretion from mucous neck cells
Redirection of blood from the gut when blood volume/pressure falls, this leads to not enough blood, no mucous, gastric ulceration
Local factors: Prostaglandins cause vasodilation so increase mucosal blood flow
Drugs - NSAIDs (aspirin, PBZ) reduce prostaglandin levels

Outline the mucosal barriers to drug absorption
?
The mucous layer is 
- viscous and highly hydrated
- Porous, allowing diffusion of macromolecules for absorption
Drugs can generally penetrate this layer
Drug adoption depends on drug crossing **lipid membranes**
Many drugs are weak acids or bases
Exist in solution at equilibrium between ionised (charged) and unionised (uncharged) species
Unionised species are better able to cross membranes
As a result, the pH of the gastrointestinal tract can affect the absorption

What are other factors that can affect drug absorption
?
The drug may bind to gut contents
Drugs may be subjected to digestion
if the absorptive surface is impaired there may be insufficient surface for absorption
If transit time is reduced there may be insufficient contract time for reabsorption
if bile acid secretion is impaired there may be reduced emulsification
Many drugs are absorbed effectively and then metabolised in the liver before reaching systemic circulation (the first pass effect)
