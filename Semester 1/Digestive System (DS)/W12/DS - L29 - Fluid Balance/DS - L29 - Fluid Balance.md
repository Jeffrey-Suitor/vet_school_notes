# DS - L29 - Fluid Balance

## Intended Learning Outcomes
- Identify the fluids that are secreted into the gastrointestinal tract daily with a concept of their volume and composition in the different species. 
- Apply an understanding of the enterosystemic fluid cycle in different animal species to explain the consequences of obstruction in different regions of the digestive tract for fluid and electrolyte balance. 
- Describe how the gastrointestinal tract can be clinically assessed in large animal species.

Outline the important GI secretions
?
Saliva
Gastric secretions
Bile Pancreatic juices
Intestinal secretions
The small intestine absorbs most, the colon absorbs remaining
Peristalsis directs unidirectionally

What is ptyalism::Excessive drooling

How do we do a physical examination on a cow
?
Auscultation (paralumbar fossa)
- No rumen contractions
- Dull ping ("pong") LHS
Palpation
- Per rectum -> Gas-distended rumen
- Oesophagus -> large foreign body
Diagnosis oesophageal obstruction

Outline salivary secretions
?
Serous and mucus secretions
- Moisten and lubricate food
- Enzymes
- Electrolytes
Volume and composition vary with species

Outline salivation in cows
?
Very large volumes of serous secretions from parotid glands
- Moisten/lubricate feed
- Better VFAs in rumen
- Bicarbonate is the important buffer
Volume
- Cattle: 100-150L /day 
  - On roughage will need 150L
  - On grain and concentrates need 40L
- Horse: 10-150 L/day
- Pig: 1-2L/day
- Dog: 2-3L/day
In cattle, rich in Na HcO3 and P04 not so much Cl-

Outline the role of saliva in acid-base balance
?
Electrolytes affect acid-base status
Strong ion difference (SID) = Na+ + K+ - Cl-
HC03 is important for maintaining balance
Normal = 40
Acidosis < 40
Alkalosis > 40
Consequences for the animal


Outline the salivation in a cow with oesophageal obstruction
?
Cow saliva: high in Na+ and HC03
Loss of saliva = loss of Na+ and HCO3
Loss of water
Cow becomes:
- Acidaemic (pH decrease)
- Hypercloraemic (Increase Cl-)
- Dehydrated (H2O decrease)

Outline the salivation in a horse with oesophageal obstruction
?
Horse saliva: high in Na+ and Cl-
Horse becomes:
- Hypochloraemic (decrease Cl-)
- Hyponatraemia (decrease Na+)
- Alkalotic rather than acidaemic

Outline the loss of fluid from the gastric intestinal tract
?
GI fluid loss
Reduced fluid reabsorption from the gut to circulation
Reduced vascular volume = hypovolaemia 
- water content in the blood reduced, the relative increase in RBCs and protein
- PAT cell volume increases
- Blood cell plasma decrease
Peripheral vasoconstriction, poor venous return
Poor perfusion, anaerobic metabolism - Lactate production

What are some signs of colic in a horse
?
Kicking at abdomen
Rolling
Pawing
Flank watching

How much reflux should you get from a horse::None

What are the major gastric secretions
?
HCL (parietal cells)
Digestive enzymes (chief cells)
Mucous (mucous cells)
Horse: 26-62 L /day
Pig: 3L/day

Outline pancreatic secretion volume and composition
?
Pig: 5L/day
Horse: 60L/day
Cattle:15-25 L/day
Sheep: 0.4-0.8 L/day
Dog: 0.2 - 1.5L/day
Pancreatic fluid composition
- Na+, HCO3 rich, alkaline
- buffers acidic gastric fluid 
- Enzymes

Outline biliary secretions
?
gall bladder allows concentration of bile
bile release from gall bladder is simulated by 
- FGood in duodenum (CCK)
- Bile acid cycling
No gall bladder (Horses, rats, hippos, rhinos)
- Continuous secretion

Outline small intestinal secretion
?
Mucous (Brunner's glands - duodenum)
Crypt cells - electrolyte secretion
- Coupled Na+ and Cl- secretion
- A large amount of HC03 is secreted in the ileum (horse)
Water follows the osmotic gradient
- Transcellular/paracellular absorption
- Enter vascular system

Outline small intestine absorption
?
Water absorption
- Always simple diffusion
Electrolytes
- Na+: co-transport proteins, Na/H exchanger, diffusion
- Cl-: coupled Na+/Cl- absroption, paracellular, Cl-/HCO3 echange
- HCO3: much used for buffering gastric HCL, remaining reabsorbed (Na/HCO3 exchange)
- Different mechanisms in different parts

Outline small intestinal peristalsis
?
peristalsis essential for the unidirectional flow of fluid through the GI tract
Obstruction
- Structural (foreign body, mass)
- Functional (ileus, inflammation)
When the bowel is obstructed:
- Absorption ceases and water moves into the lumen
- Sequestration of fluid, Na+, K+, Cl- in small intestine

T/F in hindgut fermentors, streams of diarrhea are always large intestine::True

Outline the differences in large intestines between species
?
Very large in horses (hindgut fermentation)
Dogs: Mainly H20 absorbed
Horses: Water, electrolytes, VFAs

Outline the large intestine in horses
?
Secretion HCO3, Na+, and Cl- added to colonic contents in a horse from ileum -> buffer VFAs
Water follows -> Large fluxes between colon lumen and circulation
Volumes of fluid absorption
