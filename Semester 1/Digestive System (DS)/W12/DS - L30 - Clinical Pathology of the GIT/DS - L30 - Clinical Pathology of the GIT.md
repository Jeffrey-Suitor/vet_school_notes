## Clinical Pathology

What is clinical pathology?
?
Diagnose disease
Narrow down differential diagnoses
Direct further investigations
Monitor disease progression or response to therapy
Screen for underlying disease in clinically healthy animals

How do use clinical pathology
?
Appropriate laboratory tests are selected after a full history and complete physical examination
- Identify a problem list first, to ensure the selection of appropriate and cost-effective tests
Laboratory tests are frequently used in conjunction with other diagnostic procedures, as part of an integrated diagnostic approach
- Imaging, endoscopy, laparotomy, biopsy, treatment trial

What is included in a clinical pathology test

What are biochemistry profiles::Groups of tests

What is a urinalysis
?
testing the physical and chemical characteristics of fresh urine
Collection may be free-catch, catheter or cystocentesis
Assessment of 
- Gross appearance and odour
- Urine specific gravity (USG)
- Urine 'dipstick' chemistry
- Urine sediment (microscopy)

Outline the process of cytology
?
Fine needle aspirate (FNA) or impression smear

Outline interpretation of data
?
patient history is important
Important to understand the unit
USA still uses conventional units

What are reference values
?
Derived from clinically healthy animals
Vary according to
- Species
- Breed
- Age
- Sex
- Method of collection
- Method of analysis
Need to define the population
Reference intervals usually represent the test results from 95% of the reference 'healthy' population
Therefore 2.5% of animals that are healthy will be above or below the interval

What is the baseline data for GI investigation?
?
Haematology, biochemistry, urinalysis

What are some tests you can do to evaluate the GI
?
Imaging (radiographs, ultrasonography)
Effusion analysis (TNCC/TP, cytology)
Endocrine (hyperthyroidism, hypoadrenocorticism)
Pancreas (pancreatitis, EPI)
Folate/Cobalamin (intestinal function)
mass lesions: FNA for cytology or surgical biopsy for histopathology
Faecal tests

Outline the test results associated with vomiting
?
CBC
- Marginal erythrocytosis
  - A relative increase in RBC is the most common
    - Likely secondary to fluid loss
- Inflammatory leukogram, characterised by
  - Marked mature neutrophilia
  - Mild monocytosis
  - Moderate lymphopenia ('stress')
Serum biochemistry
- Increase ura (normal creatinine)
  - Consistent with dehydration (pre-renal azotemia)
    - Increased urea absorption in renal tubules
    - Decreased glomerular filtration rate (hypoperfusion)
- Increased urea may also occur with GI bleeding
  - Less likely in this case, as erythrocytosis and high normal albumin support dehydration rather than anaemia
- Decreased electrolytes - Na, K, Cl
  - Electrolyte loss via persistent/severe vomiting
  - Note that there appears to be a more marked decrease in **Chloride** compared to sodium
    - Suggests vomiting of gastric contents
    - Pyloric obstruction or gastritis

How do you evaluate Na and CL in serum biochemistry?
?
Chloride and sodium should move together when changes only relate to water
Determining if there is a selective loss or gain of chloride helps refine DDx and also suggests ana cid base disturbed
- Calculate corrected CL
- Corrected CL = CL * Normal Na  / measured NA
  - Normal Na is the midpoint of Na ref interval
  - CL corrected should be within the Cl ref interval
    - If not in interval, selective Cl loss is confirmed
      - Gastric vomiting, concern for pyloric obstruction
      - Metabolic alkalosis is very likely (need blood gas to confirm)

Outline the CBC for diarrhoea
?
Milk erythrocytosis
- Likely secondary to dehydration
- Supported by physical exam and increased urea with 'normal' creatinine (pre-renal azotaemia)
Decreased TS
- Gastrointestinal protein loss is most likely
- Neep TP + Albumin to further characterize
Leukopenia due to neutropenia with degenrative left shift and lymphopenia
- Indicates overwhelming inflammatory demand, exceeding the bone marrow's production capacity
  - Immature neutrophils (bands) released (left shift)
  - Bands exceed mature neutrophils (degenerative)
- A common feature of severe enteritis caused by an infectious agent 
- Lymphopenia: 'stress' response

Outline the biochemistry of diarrhoea
?
Hyponatraemia and hypochloraemia
- Both are moderately decreased
- Proportionate loss, likely from GIT
  - Diarrhoea can be an explosive event in horses
  - Massive fluid and electrolyte losses ina. short time
Hyperkalaemia
- Likely secondary to metabolic acidosis
  - Titrational: lactic acid production secondary to hypovolaemia or ischaemia (anaerobic metabolism)
Mildly increased CK and AST indicate muscle damage
- Consistent with prior strenuous exercise and or ischaemia from recumbency
- Unlikely to be due to exertional rhabdomyolysis
  - Values would be much greater (CK > 10 000 U/L)

Outline some potential ways to rule out a diagnosis of hypoproteinaemia
?
Haemorrhage
- Expect panhypoproteinaemia plus anaemia
Liver failure
- Expect decreased alb, chol, glu, urea
Protein-losing nephropathy
- Expect hypoalb, hyperchol, plus proteinuria
PLE
- Expect weight loss, panhyporpoteinaemia, hypocholesterinemia

What are the reference values for peritoneal fluid?
?
Volume: low
Colour: colourless
Turbidity: Clear
TNCC: <3 x 10^9 in small animals and < 5 x 10^9 in horses
Types of cells
- Mostly mononuclear cells (macrophages, lymphocytes, mesothelial cells), with rare neutrophils in small animals
- Mostly neutrophils in horses
Protein content: <25g /L

What is effusion::Increased volume of fluid in a body cavity (Peritoneal, pleural, pericardial, synovial)

How do we classify effusions
?
Classified according to appearance, TNCC, TS, cytology (and possible other biochemistry tests)
Low protein transudate
High protein transudate (modified transudate)
Exudate
Other
- Haemorrhagic effusion
- Chylous effusion
- Uroperitoneum
- Neoplastic effusion

Outline transudate types
?
Normal gross appearance
Low cell count, low protein
- Hypoalbuminaemia (< 15g/L)
- Local and systemic venous hypertension, chronic hepatic diseases such as portosystemic shunt or cirrhosis
High protein transudate (modified transudate)
Milkd increase in protein, normal TNCC
Congestive heart failure, thrombosis of caudal vena cava, early cases of organ torsion

What is an exudate
?
Usually discoloured and turbid
Increased TNCC and TS
- Inflammation (increased vascular permeability at serosal surfaces)
- Neutrophils usually predominate
- Macrophages may be numerous and phagocytic
- If the cause is bacterial infection may see degeneration of neutrophils and the presence of organisms
- Bile leakage, chylous effusion, uroperitoneum and neoplasia may cause an exudate

Outline haemorrhage effusion
?
Haemorrhage or diapedesis of RBC can be part of exudate or other effusions
- A little bit of blood goes a long way
- DDx blood contamination at the collection
  - Platelets indicate haemorrhage at the collection
  - Phagocytosis of RBC and/or haemosiderinophages indicate prior haemorrhage
- The haemorrhagic effusion may occur in its own right
  - Usually in coagulopathy (vitamin K antagonist poisoning)

Outline bile peritonitis
?
Fluid may have a gritty texture
bile is irritant and provokes a good inflammatory response
Total bilirubin concentration in fluid > blood

Outline Chyloabdomen
?
Fluid is often opalescent (likely more so in chylothorax due to chylomicrons)
Initially, cells are almost all small lymphocytes
With time, the increase of neutrophils and macrophages

Outline uroperitoneum
?
Urine is irritant; provokes an inflammatory response
Initially urea concentration in fluid >>> blood; same for creatine concentration
With time, these substances equilibrate across the peritoneum; urea equilibrates more rapidly
In the uroperitoneum, fluid urea concentration and creatinine concentration will always be greater that the corresponding blood value
Cases develop marked hyperkalaemia (with clinical consequences)

Outline neoplasia effusion
?
The effusion may appear as transudate, modified transudate, or exudate
Neoplastic cells may or may not be visible
Causes include: lymphosarcoma, metastatic tumours (especially carcinomas), haemangiosarcomas, mast cell tumour, mesothelioma
Mesothelial cells
Haemorrhagic effusion

Outline lymphangiectasia
?
Lacteal dilation
The most commonly reported cause of PLE in dogs
Most cases are idiopathic - some are congenital or secondary to obstruction

Outline exocrine pancreatic insufficiency
?
German shepherds are predisposed
Loss of pancreatic enzymes (Lipase, Amylase, and Proteases (trypsin))
Maldigestion
Causes include
- Pancreatic acinar atrophy
- Secondary to chronic pancreatitis
Extensive loss of pancreatic mass required before signs of EPI evident (90%)
Clinical signs
- Chronic diarrhoea
  - Voluminous, pale, greasy, rancid faeces
- Weight loss, good appetite (coprophagia)
Routine clinical pathology diagnostics
- Haematology and serum biochemistry are usually unremarkable (amylase and lipase within WRI)
- Panhypoproteinaemia is usually not a feature
Faecal tests for maldigestion-poor Sn/Sp are no longer used routinely
Serum TLI
- Trypsin-like immunoreactivity tests
- EPI is confirmed by subnormal fasting sTLI (<2.5 ng/ml), 5.2-35 ng/mL is normal)
- Persistent low normal may be subclinical epi
- False negatives
  - Non-fasted, decreased GFR, active pancreas
Serum folate end serum cobalamin
- used to evaluate intestinal function (absroption)
- Vitamin B12 abnormalities are common with EPI
  - 82% of dogs, 100% cats have decreased cobalamin (folate can vary depending on concurrent disease)
- Recommended to assess folate nad cobalamin with TLI
  - Supplementation with vit B12 may be necessary before an optimal response to enzyme supplementation is achieved
  - In addition, if TLI is normal, then finding a decreased folate nad cobalamin supports a malabsorption disorder
