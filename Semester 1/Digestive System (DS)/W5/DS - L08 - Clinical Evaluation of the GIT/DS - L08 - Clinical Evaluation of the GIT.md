# DS - L08 - Clinical Evaluation of the GIT

## Intended Learning Outcomes
- Take a thorough history to establish the likelihood of digestive system dysfunction in animals. 
- Differentiate normal and abnormal digestive system function based on physical examination findings. 
- Apply an understanding of the physiology of the digestive system to localise disease process. 
- Describe some of the diagnostic aids that will enable further investigation of the digestive system.

What are some of the most common presenting complaints and clinical signs
?
Weight loss (sudden, or prolonged)
Diarrhoea 
Vomiting/regurgitation
Halitosis (bad breath)
Oral pain
Dysphagia
Abdominal pain (emergency if severe)
Abdominal enlargement / 'bloat' (emergency if severe)
Other

What important questions do you need to answer when coming to a differential diagnosis
?
Is the problem likely to be self-limiting?
Does the animal need treatment? (Symptomatic treatment or specific/invasive/aggressive treatment)
Does the animal need surgery? (elective/emergency)
Does there need to be more investigation? (Individual/herd)

What is important to establish for yourself when diagnosing
?
Refined problem list
Prioritised differential diagnosis list
Taking a good history and completing a thorough physical examination

### History

T/F Sometimes the history can be delayed::True, if in an emergency you treat the obvious issue

T/F Sometimes history needs to be taken outside the clinic/hospital::True, parvovirus would be an example where you don't want to bring that dog inside the clinic

What is the most important part of chronic or non-life-threatening presentations:the history is the most important part of the clinical evaluation, keeping detailed records

What is the signalment::species, breed, sex, age, colour

What is the general outline for gathering history
?
1. Nature and timeframe of presenting complaint
2. Prophylaxis: Vaccination status, deworming status
3. Current medications
4. Prior treatment: When? Duration? Response
5. Any non-gastrointestinal signs
6. Appetite
7. Changes in body condition

What aspects regarding diet are important to record
?
Especially important for disorders that might involve the digestive system
Current diet:
- Quality (What food(s) - brand/source? Treats?)
- Quantity (How much? How often?)
- Provision (Competition? Indoor/outdoor? Scavenger)
Recent changes in diet?: When? What was the former diet
Access to other food sources in environment? (Toxins?)
Individual or herd?

What aspects regarding vomiting and regurgitation are important to record on the clinical examination
?
Regurgitation: passive process, always oesophageal problem
Vomiting: active process, Can be primary gastrointestinal problem
Can be metabolic/toxic issue

What important aspects of diarrhoea is important to record for the history
?
Volume / frequency
Consistency
Appearance: 
- Blood (fresh/melena)
- Mucous
- Pallor
Small or large intestine

What are some aspects of the clinical examination that can be done from a distance
?
Demeanour and behaviour
Posture and gait
Defecation and urination
Respiratory rate
Environment: bedding, feeding equipment, hygiene, ventilation

What are the two types of physical examinations
?
Abbreviated (major body system assessment) in emergency situations (distress, collapse) (cardiovascular, respiratory, neurological systems)
Through, systematic examination including the digestive system

What will cause variation in the animal species::context/environment/husbandry, handling/restraint, anatomy/physiology

What is the core list of elements you want to include in a physical examination
?
Body condition
Mentation and demeanour
Rectal temperature
Auscultation: heart rate & rhythm, lung sounds, borborygmi
Hydration status: skin turgor, mucous membrane colour & capillary refill time
Palpation: Pulses, body surface, joint/limb swelling or pain, pitting oedema
Oral examination: dental health, foreign bodies, masses, ulceration

Why is body condition an important element in the clinical exam
?
Prioritisation of differentials can vary with body condition
10-year-old at presenting with vomiting if obese pancreatitis high on DDx list or if thin infiltrative bowel disease higher on DDx list
Revisit history to query owner observations or clarify timeframes if necessary

Why is it important to assess the oral cavity during the clinical exam::owners can fail to identify severe mouth disease

What is pitting oedema::The fluid that accumulates in the interstitium, increased vascular pressures or lack of plasma oncotic pressure which is common in animals that have malabsorption conditions where they can't properly take up proteins. Hypoproteinia can cause the oedema

What are important signs to look out for when doing abdominal auscultation and percussion::borborygmi, rumen contractions, illeocaecal valve flush

What are some important sighs to look out for when doing abdominal palpation and ballottement::organ size and position, foreign body and masses, lymph nodes

Why is it important to perform abdominal palpation in small animals
?
Can detect organomegaly, foreign bodies
Should be able to feel:
- Both kidneys
- Urinary bladder
- Intestinal loops
- Caudal margin of the liver
- Faecal balls
Should not be able to feel:
- Spleen
- Lymph nodes

Why / how do we do rectal examinations
?
Small animals - digital palpation

What is nasogastric intubation::horses can't vomit but can have fluid build up and so nasogastric intubation allows us to drain the stomach

What will you have established by the end of your physical examination
?
Whether the animal is likely to have an infectious disease
Where the animal requires treatment (symptomatic, specific, treatment trial)
Whether further investigation is required
Usually, localisation of the disorder, and sometimes the diagnosis

What are the common method for diagnosing clinical pathology::haematology and serum biochemistry, urinalysis, faecal analysis, abdominocentesis

What are some common imaging modalities used in veterinary medicine::radiography, ultrasound

What is a way to look inside the stomach::endoscopy - imaging, biopsy, FB retrieval and exploratory laparotomy (+/- biopsy)

What is an exploratory laparotomy
?
If no response to non-specific treatment
Suspected foreign body/mass
Suspected septic peritonitis
Biopsy if abdomen looks grossly normal
