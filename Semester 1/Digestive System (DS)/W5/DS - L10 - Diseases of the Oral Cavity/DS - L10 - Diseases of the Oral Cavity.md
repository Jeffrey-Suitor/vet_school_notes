# DS - L10 - Diseases of the Oral Cavity

## Intended Learning Outcomes
- Analyse the developmental anomalies of the oral cavity and its consequences. 
- Classify the inflammatory lesions in the oral cavity of domestic animals based on aetiology and pathogenesis. 
- Identify and differentiate the proliferative lesions of the oral cavity of domestic animals.

## Portals of Pathogens

What are some portal that pathogens can use to enter the body::ingestion (most common), coughed up and swallow (Rhodococcus pneumonia), systemic blood-borne infections, parasite migration

How does the oral cavity protect against infections
?
Structure:
- Stratified squamous epithelium - high rate of epithelial turnover
- Taste buds
Resident flora: competitive attachment
Innate immunity:
- Secreted immunoglobulins
- Phagocytes and other effector cells within submucosa
Saliva:
- Flushing actions
- Contains lysozyme, lactoferrin, lactopreoxidase

What are the basic reactions of gastrointestinal tract?
Altered physiology (secretion, absorption and motility)
Cellular degeneration and necrosis
Inflammation
Cell proliferation  and neoplasia

What is the standard oral pathology you are looking for in the oral mucosa::smooth, shiny, pink

What are some other apperance of mucous membrane colour and the condition it implies
?
| Colour      | cause                    |
| ----------- | ------------------------ |
| White       | Anaemia                  |
| Red         | Inflamation (hyperaemia) |
| Yellow      | Jaundice                 |
| Blue/purple | Cyanosis                 |

What are some abnormalities in the facial cleft::Palatoschisis (cleft palate), Cheiloschisis (cleft lips)

What are some abnormalities in the mandible/maxilla
?
Brachygnathia inferior (short mandible) *Overshot*
Brachygnathia superior (short maxilla) *Undershot*
Prognathia inferior (long mandible)
Prognathia superior (long maxilla)
Agnathia (absence of mandible)

What is palatoschisis and what is the consequence in animals::when the hard palate and all of soft palate have failed to fuse together during embryogenesis. This allows for direct communication between oral and nasal cavities and can lead to pneumonia

What is cheiloschisis::when the lips and the hard palate fail to fuse

What are some potential abnormalities related to dental diseases
?
Abnormalities in number of teeth
Abnormalities in position of teeth
Enamel hypoplasia
Odontodystrophies:
- Calcium and phosphorus deficiency
- Fluorosis, lead and silver poisoning
Plaque and calculus
Tooth abscess

What causes enamel hypoplasia
?
Enamel is fully formed when the tooth erupts. 
Some infections like BVDV virus (Bovine Viral diarrhoea) in cattle (in utero infection) and canine distemper virus in dogs leads to necrosis and disorganisation of the enamel organ.
Segmental enamel hypoplasia results from lack of enamel formation during the period of virus infection.

What is the appearance of teeth suffering from fluorosis
?
Excessive fluoride in the diet can lead to fluoride incorporation into the enamel and dentine. This result is soft chalky discoloured enamel, usually yellow, dark brown or black

What are some common terms used in regards to inflammation of the oral mucosa
?
| Term        | Definition  |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Stomatitis  | oral cavity |
