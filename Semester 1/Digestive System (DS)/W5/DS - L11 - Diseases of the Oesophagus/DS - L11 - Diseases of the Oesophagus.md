# DS - L11 - Diseases of the Oesophagus

## Intended Learning Outcomes
- Analyse the pathogenesis and consequence of megaoesophgus, â€˜chokeâ€™ and oesophagitis. 
- Identify the common parasitic and neoplastic diseases affecting the oesophagus of domestic animals. 
- Identify some important causes of upper gastrointestinal diseases.

## Proliferative Diseases of the Oral Cavity

What are the benign lesions of the oral cavity
?
Gingival hyperplasia
Fibromatous epulis
Acanthomatous epulis
Oral papillomatosis

What are the malignant lesions of the oral cavity
?
Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)
Melanoma
Fibrosarcoma

Describe gingival hyperplasia
?
Bening growth
Overgrowth of gum tissue - fibrous submucosa
Common in brachycephalic breeds, Boxers
Causes - dental plaques/tartar, some drugs
Both jaws are affected
Can cause malalignment of teeth

What is fibromatous epulis
?
Benign growth
Renamed as "periodontal fibroma"
A tumour of dental tissue
Clinically indistinguishable from gingival hyperplasia
Solitary growth
Surgical removal is curative
Arises from the periodontal ligament

What is acanthomatous epulis
?
Common tumour of dogs, arising from odontogenic epithelium
Behaves aggressively, invade to the local bone
Gray-pink papillary to sessile gingival mass in the vicinity of alveolus
Histologically, sheet or cords of polyhedral epithelium (acanthocytes)

What is oral papillomatosis
?
Benign epithelial tumours
In dogs, cats, and cattle
Caused by papilloma virus, transmitted by close contact
Unsightly, multicentric growth
Spontaneous recovery occurs
Antibody-mediated immunity to reinfection

What is squamous cell carcinoma
?
Malignant epithelial tumour
Most common oral malignancy in cats
Locally invasive tumours
Grossly irregular, slightly nodular, red-gray, friable mass with ulcerated surface and bleeds easily
Common sites - ventral surface of tongue, gingiva, tonsils
The mucosa is focally and markedly thickened by a poorly demarcated, moderately cellular, unencapsulated, verrucous, infiltrative neoplasm
The deep margin, neoplastic keratinocytes breach the basement membrane, infiltrating the adjacent dermis ass individual and small groups of cells

What is melanoma
?
Most common oral malignancy in dogs
Highly aggressive neoplasm with metastasis to regional LN
Amelanotic melanoma common - varied pigmentation
No relationship between amount of pigment and biological behaviour
Macrophages will be taking up the melanin pigment

What is fibrosarcoma
?
Third most common oral malignancy in dogs
Freqnetly occurs in young dogs < 5 years of age
Rapid growth, invade maxillary or mandibular bone recurs after surgical removal
Metastasis to regional LN or to lungs

What are tonsils
?
Lympho-organs present at the base of the tongue
Distinct species differences
Tonsillitis: Viral, bacterial
Foreign bodies
Tumours: lymphoma, SCC

What are salivary glands
?
Major and minor glands
Ptyalism: Stomatitis, CNS disease, poisoning with organophosphates
Salivary cysts: salivary mucocoele
Sialadenitis: necrotizing - an entity in dogs
Adenocarcinoma of salivary glands

T/F diseases of the mouse can extend into the oesophagus::True

What is megaoesophagus
?
Oesophagus is too large/dilated
Congenital: Persistent right aortic arch, idiopathic
Acquired: Muscle disease (myasthenia gravis), idiopathic

Describe how persistent right aortic arch can cause megaoesophagus::normally the right aortic arch disappears but if it stays it can form a vascular ring around the trachea and oesophagus, the oesophagus is constricted more because it is a soft tube, appears as fluid accumulation after the heart
Due to regurgitation the presentation is normally as a pneumonia
Vomiting and not gaining wait

What is esophageal perforation
?
The oesophagus has been perforated by an ingested chicken bone
Note that the end fo the bone opposite to the perforation has caused a deep ulcer
There are several chronic ulcers caudal to the perforation

What is a choke in the oesophagus
?
Foreign bodies can cause a choke with mucosal ulceration and perforation.
The healing if the animal survives can cause stenosis due to healing by fibrosis
There will be pressure necrosis which is caused by tissue hypoxia

What is reflux oesophagitis
?
The dark red streaks are areas of epithelial loss, secondary to gastric reflux, The white streaks are areas of unaffected mucosa
If the sphincter is not tight enough there will be esophageal reflux

What are two types of parasites that infect the oesophagus::gongylonema sp (worm like appearance)., sarcocytosis (many nodules)

What is spirocerca lupi
?
Produce nodules in the oesophagus
nematode
Stomach -> aortic wall -> distal oesophagus -> granulomatous inflammation and fibroplasia -> neoplasia (fibrosarcoma)
Sequelae: dysphagia, perforation, neoplasia (fibrosarcoma)
Dog and scavengers/wild canids
The nodlues beneath mucosa, the nodules are composed of granulomatous inflammation (macrophages) in which parasites are embedded

What are some other causes of parasitic oesophagitis::capillaria spp in birds, trichomoniasis in birds and reptiles

What is oesophageal leiomyoma
?
Disease of smooth muscle of oesophagus
Dysphagia, vomiting, etc.
