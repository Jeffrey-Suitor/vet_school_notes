# DS - L5 - From Mouth To Stomach
## Intended Learning Outcomes
- Utilise your knowledge of the structure and location of the salivary glands in different species, in order to relate this to differences in diet and feeding.  
- Explain the process of bolus formation and swallowing, in order to relate the structural features of  the tongue and pharynx to their function.
- Apply your knowledge of the structure of the oesophagus and its relationships to other anatomical structures, in order to understand the potential physical and functional mechanisms by which obstruction may occur.

What are the functions of saliva
?
moistens food, assists in taste and mastication
lubricates bolus during deglutition
amylase for starch digestion
oral hygiene
alkaline buffering (ruminants)
evaporative cooling (panting)

Where are the scattered salivary glands located::lips, cheeks, soft palate, and tongue

What are the differences in secretion between the scattered salivary glands and the large salivary glands::scattered:secretions mostly mucous (carbohydrate-rich), distinct: secretion mostly serous (watery and protein-rich)

What are the 4 main salivary glands::parotid, mandibular, sublingual, buccal

Describe the parotid salivary gland
?
located superficially ventral to ear
larger in herbivores than carnivores
Dog:
- Travels across lateral surface of masseter muscle
- Opening in vestibule adjacent to upper fourth premolar tooth
Horse and cow:
- Medial to ventral border of mandible
- Crosses ventral border of mandible laterally
- Enter vestibule as for dog

Where is the mandibular salivary gland located::located at angle of jaw, deeper and larger in herbivores, duct opens at sublingual caruncle (close to frenulum)

Where is the sublingual gland located::monostomatic (single duct) and polystomatic (multiple ducts) parts. Ducts run along floor of oral cavity and open adjacent to frenulum

Where is the zygomatic gland located and in what species::dog and cat, medial to zygomatic arch (in orbit), duct opens opposite last upper molar

Describe the microscopic structure of salivary glands
?
Branching duct system: acinus -> intercalated duct -> striated duct -> interlobular duct -> primary duct
Secretory cells arrange in acini: cluster of cells arranged around a lumen
The striated ducts are larger
Surrounded by a basement membrane
Contain serous and mucous acini, or both

What are the two types of saliva: mucous (carbohydrate rich), serous (watery and protein rich)

Describe the histological appearance of serous cells in the salivary gland acini::cells pyramidal, round basal nuclei, basophilic prenuclear, cytoplasm, secretory granules in apical cytoplasm, stain purple

Describe the histological appearance of mucous cells: cells swollen with mucous secretions, flattened basal nucleus, stain red

Describe the appearance of a mixed salivary gland in the acini::individual acini composed entirely of serous or mucous cells, or both, serous demilunes in mixed acini

T/F the Parotid gland is a purely serous gland in all species::False, while it is a purely serous gland in most species it is not in the dog

T/F The mandibular and sublingual glands are mixed mucous and serous glands::True

What are the 4 types of salivary ducts
?
intercalated duct: smallest, drains each acini, low cuboidal epithelium
Striated duct: columnar epithelium with basal striations (alignment of mitochondria), bulks up saliva and add bicarbonate to buffer
Intralobular duct: large duct within lobule
Interlobular duct: simple columnar -> stratified columnar epithelium

Describe the control of salivary secretion as well as the innervation of the mandibular, sublingual, buccal, zygomatic, and parotid glands
?
Autonomic nervous system under parasympathetic control
mandibular, sublingual, buccal, and zygomatic glands innervated by facial nerve (CN 7)
Parotid gland innervated by cranial nerve 9 (glossopharyngeal)

T/F parasympathetic stimulation can enhance salivary secretion::True, parasympathetic stimulation can greatly enhance secretion as well as blood flow to salivary glands

What are some stimuli that would increase salivation
?
presence of food or irritating substances in mouth
thoughts of or the smell of food (demonstrated by Pavlov)
many stressful stimuli also induce excessive salivation (thunder)

What is the pharynx and describe it's shape::funnel shaped muscular tube, region common to digestive and respiratory tracts, demarcated from oral cavity by palatoglossal arch, lined by mucosa with mucous glands, collagen, elastic fibres

What are the two parts of the pharynx::nasopharynx (dorsal to soft palate) and oropharynx (ventral to soft palate)

The walls of the muscles are formed by what 3 muscle groups::constrictors, dilator, shortener

What innervates the pharynx::motor and sensory are innervated from cranial nerve 9 (glossopharyngeal) and cranial nerve 10 (vagus)

What is the role of the pharynx::lymphoid tissue (defence against infection) which is scattered and in tonsils, tonsils have smooth surface (palatine tonsil, dog) or crypts (palatine tonsil, horse)

T/F horses can only breath through their nose due to the structure of the pharynx::True, there is a continuous passage for the nasopharynx to the lungs which prevents air from the oropharynx from getting in

Describe the process of deglutition (swallowing)
?
Initiated voluntarily but taken over by reflexes once food reaches pharynx
1. Bolus of food prepared by mastication and insalivation
2. Apex of tongue pressed against palate
3. Rapid contraction of mylohyoideus and extrinsic muscles of tongue to propel food into pharynx
4. contact with pharyngeal mucosa sets off reflexes
5. Soft palate raised, glottis (narrowest part of larynx) closed, hyoid apparatus drawn rostrally, pharynx shortened (by pharyngeal shorteners)
6. Bolus moved into oesophagus by pharyngeal constrictors
7. Wave of peristalsis conveys bolus to stomach

What is the structure of the oesophagus::simple muscular tube, runs from the cricoid cartilage of the larynx to the cardia of the stomach, divided into cervical, thoracic, and abdominal sections

What is the structure of the cervical oesophagus
?
Pharynx to thoracic inlet
Ventral to subvertebral muscles (longus colli and longus capitis)
Begins in median plane dorsal to trachea
Inclines to the left
Prior to thoracic inlet is left lateral to trachea

T/F if you damage the oesophagus you can just cut and connect a piece lower down::False, you can do this with the stomach but not the oesophagus do to it's limited space

Describe the thoracic oesophagus
?
First rib to the oesophageal hiatus
Runs in the mediastinum between the lungs
Passes over the base of the heart
Crosses the right side of the aortic arch
Runs dorsal to the tracheal bifurcation
Runs caudally in the mediastinum ventral to the aorta

Describe the abdominal oesophagus
?
Very short
Ventral surface indents the dorsal border of the liver
Joins the stomach dorsally at the cardia
Well developed cardiac sphincter in the horse, vomiting very rare

What are the 4 layers of the oesophagus from the innermost layer to the outermost
?
mucosa: comprised of epithelium which is in contact with food in lumen of small intestine, lamina propria, thin layer of smooth muscle cells called muscularis mucosa 
submucosa: connective tissue containing mucous secreting glands
muscularis externa: inner circular fibres for constricting oesophagus and an outer longitudinal layer
adventitia or serosa: outer connective tissue, neck = adventitia, thorax = serosa (simple squamous mesothelial secreting fluid)

Describe the species variation in the muscularis externa
?
Pig, horse, cat: Cranially striated muscle, caudally smooth muscle
Dog, ruminant: entirely striated muscle
Functional cranial and caudal sphincters

Describe the blood supply of the oesophagus::Branches of the: common carotid artery, bronchoesophageal artery, left gastric artery

Describe the nerve supply of the oesophagus::branches of the vagus and sympathetic nerves

What are some of the unique adaptations to the oesophagus in birds::oesophagus on right side of neck in cervical region, crop: saccular diverticulum of oesophagus cranial to thoracic inlet
