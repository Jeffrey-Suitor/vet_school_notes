# DS - L7 - Simple Stomach and Abomasum
## Intended Learning Outcomes
- Utilise your knowledge of the anatomy of the stomach in order to integrate its structural features with their function.  
- Apply an understanding of the position of the stomach within the abdominal cavity, in order to determine the nature of displacements or obstructions when they occur.  
- Apply an understanding of the relationship of the stomach with other abdominal organs and structures, in order to relate this to the potential for their involvement in disease or displacement.  
- Utilise your knowledge of species differences in stomach anatomy in order to integrate these structural differences with differences in digestive function.

What is the simple stomach::musculo-glandular organ, usually C or J shaped, four regions: cardiac, fundic, body, pyloric

What is the widest part of the stomach::fundus

What is the function of rugae::allow for distension of the stomach to allow it to fill after a meal (more linear as we approach pyloric sphincter)

What are the features of the simple stomach
?
Two surfaces: Parietal (cranial) and Visceral (caudal)
Two curvatures: Lesser and greater
Two extremities: Cardia and Pylorus

What is the orientation of the simple stomach
?
Lies in transverse position
Largely to the left of the median plane
Highly distensible
Mucosa is thrown up into folds - rugae

T/F The stomach will extend beyond the ribcage::False, after a meal a stomach can extend beyond the ribcage

What are the supporting membranes in the simple stomach
?
Greater omentum
Lesser omentum
- Hepatogastric ligament
- Hepatoduodenal ligament - contains:
  - Portal vein
  - Hepatic artery
  - Bile duct
  - Lymphatic duct

What is the name of the space between two sheets of greater omentum::omental bursa

What is the blood supply of the stomach::branches of the Celiac artery (splenic, hepatic, left gastric, gastro-duodenal arteries), veins drain into the Portal vein

What is the nerve supply of the simple stomach::branches of the Vagus and Sympathetic nerves

Describe the structure of the stomach wall
?
External peritoneum (serosa)
Muscularis externa: outer longitudinal layer, middle circular layer, inner oblique layer
Submucosa
Mucosa

What are the regions of mucosa in the simple stomach
?
Non glandular region
Cardiac glands: mucus secreting
Fundic gland region: gastric juice (HCl, pepsin)
Pyloric mucosa, mucus secreting

Describe the non-glandular (oesophageal) region of the stomach
?
Stratified squamous keratinized epithelium
Lamina propria
Fascicles of smooth muscle (muscularis mucosae)
Submucosa (loose connective tissue with blood vessels)
Muscularis externa (tunica muscularis) 
- Outer: longitudinal
- Middle: circular
- Inner: oblique
Outside is simple squamous mesothelial cells

What are the implications of having a non-glandular region of the stomach in the horse::not secreting mucous which is normally protecting the stomach which can lead to gastric ulcerations in the horse. Typically found along the dividing line of glandular and non-glandular regions (margo plicatus)

Describe the layers of the glandular region of the simple stomach
?
Mucosa:
- Simple columnar epithelium - mucus secreting
- Form gastric pits
- Tubular mucosal glands - gastric glands
  - Extend to muscularis mucosa
  - open into base of gastric pits
Submucosa: no glands
Muscularis externa: inner oblique, middle circular, outer longitudinal
Outer serosa: continuous covered in peritoneum

What are the different types of gastric mucosa (cardiac glands)
?
Gastric pits: simple columnar epithelium
Glands: short branched and coiled (beneath pits, extend through lamina propria)
- Mainly mucous cells
- Cuboidal or low columnar epithelium

Describe the structure of the fundic region
?
Very active secreting area
Secretes stomach acid and digestive enzymes
Very active and long glands
Very thick mucosa 
Glands extend through the lamina propria to the muscularis mucosa
No glands in submucosa

What are the specialized cell types found in the fundic region
?
The regions are the neck, body, base
Mucous neck cells (closest to neck): 
- Cuboidal to lower columnar cells
- Flat basal nuclei
- Cytoplasm slightly more basophilic than surface epithelium
- Disc shaped
Chief cells (body):
- Cuboidal to pyramidal
- Basal cytoplasm basophilic - RER
- Produce enzymes
Parietal cells (base): 
- Large pyramidal shaped cells
- Eosinophilic cytoplasm - mitochondria
- Produce HCl
Endocrine cells (not identifiable):
- G cells (gastrin)
- D cells (somastostatin)
- Mast cells (histamine)
- ECL cells (histamine)

What are the pyloric gland region
?
Mucous secretion only
Deep gastric pits
Glands: branched, coiled and short
Mucous cells: flat basal nuclei, pale staining cytoplasm
Mucosa -> Submucosa -> Muscularis externa -> Serosa

Provide an overview of the canine stomach structure::C shaped, relatively large (0.5 to 6 L), extensive greater omentum, wide cardia, fundus is largest region, smaller cardiac region

What function does wide cardiac band and right angle allow dogs to perform::Allows them to readily vomit up their food for their pups

Provide an overview of the equine stomach
?
J shaped
Relatively small (5-15 L)
Saccus caecus: non-glandular sac
Margo plicatus - line of demarcation
Greater omentum - relatively small
Oesophagus joins cardia at oblique angle (vomiting rate)
Transverse orientation
Sits between ribs 10-13
Will never distend beyond the costal arch

What are the significant features found on the outside of the equine stomach
?
Lesser curvature is very small and tight, larger greater curvature
Saccus caecus is the left extremity
Acute oesophagus entry 
Oesophagus has a very thick smooth muscle wall close to cardia forming a tight cardiac sphincter
As stomach distends it forces the oesophagus shut
Saccus caecus and is a non glandular region with folded mucosa where bacteria can sit, no secretions
Margo plicatus is the sharp demarcation at which glandular tissue begins secretes acids and enzymes
Tight pyloric sphincter

Provide an overview of the porcine stomach::Irregular J shaped, relatively large, diverticulum, torus pyloricus, very extensive cardiac gland region (largest region)

What is the relative size of the cardiac region in the compound stomach::quite small, a small band

What are the primary features of the avian stomach
?
Two parts separated by the isthmus
Proventriculus - small
Gizzard - large muscular organ

Describe the function of the gizzard::food enters and is combined with enzymes and acids, the caudoventral blind sac contains grit or stones and when the gizzard moves it will grind the feed using that grit or stones.

What is the histology of the ventriculus::quite hard, waxy secretion called cuticle of tough coiling material which prevents the abrasion
