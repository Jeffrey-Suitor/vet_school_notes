# DS - L26 - Embryology

## Intended Learning Outcomes
- Explain the developmental anatomy in the embryo of the mouth and associated structures, including the tongue in order to elaborate on the origin of anatomical structures in adult animals and common malformations. 
- Describe the derivatives of the primitive gut tube (fore-, mid-, hindgut) in order to explain the relations between organs in adult animals. 
- Discuss the developmental anatomy of the oesophagus, stomach and intestines in order to elaborate on their orientation in adult animals.

## Embryology

What is the primitive gut?
?
the embryonic disk becomes tubular by lateral body folding, which separates the embryo from the extra-embryonic membranes
Cranial and caudal body folding creates a C-shaped embryo
This forms a T-like structure with the foregut in front, hindgut behind, and midgut right in the middle of it
Within the embryo:
- Foregut
- Midgut
- Hindgut
Extraembryonic
- Yolk sac
- Allantois

What structures are derived from the foregut
?
Parts of the oral cavity
Pharynx / Oesophagus
Stomach / Promixal duodenum
Liver and Pancreas
Thyroid / Parathyroid / Thymus
Trachea and Lungs

What structures are derived from the midgut
?
Duodenum to the transverse colon

What features are derived from the hindgut
?
The distal part of the transverse colon to descending colon
Cloaca -> anal canal / urogenital sinus

Outline the blood supply of the foregut, midgut, and hindgut
?
Foregut = celiac artery
Midget = cranial mesenteric
Hindgut = caudal mesenteric

Outline the primitive mouth
?
Stomodaeum = ectodermal depression at the rostral end of the embryo
Oropharyngeal membrane = membrane composed of ectoderm and endoderm which separates stomodeum from the foregut
Epithelium of mouth is ectodermal
Rest is endoderm

What is the role of pharyngeal arches and frontonasal prominence::head and neck formation?

What is the frontonasal prominence?
?
Gives rise to
- Frontal process
- 2 lateral nasal processes
- 2 medial nasal processes

What happens to the first pharyngeal arch 
?
Mandibular arch
Left and Right maxillary process
Left and right Mandibular process
Elongation of these processes forms the oral cavity

Outline facial development
?
Upper jaw/lips: Naso-medial processes + maxillary processes
Nose: Frontal process + naso-lateral processes
Lower jaw/lips: Fusion of the mandibular processes

Outline upper lip anatomy between species
?
Sheep - cleft upper lip
Carnivore - groove in the upper lip
Horse/cattle - smooth upper lip

Outline dolichocephalic and brachycephalic
?
Dolocephalic - long nose
Brachycephalic - short nose

Outline the development of the oral cavity
?
Primary palate atrophies creating one big cavity
Large tongue reaching into the nasal cavity
The oral cavity grows faster than the tongue
Sulcus between lips/cheeks and gingiva forms
The secondary palate derives from 
- Lateral palatine processes (2)
- Maxillary process (rostral)

Outline cleft palate formation
?
Failure of palatine processes (but not maxillary processes) to fuse
Serious consequences for suckling neonate

Outline the development of the tongue
?
Arises from the floor of the pharynx
Mesenchyma swelling
1. Median tongue swelling (ectoderm, body)
2. Two lateral tongue swellings (ectoderm, body)
3. Hypopharyngeal swellings (endoderm, root)
Sulcus in the tongue from lateral swellings does not quote merging
Torus (cow) comes from more median tongue swelling

Outline the formation of the esophagus
?
The narrowed cranial end of the foregut
Elongation occurs during the growth
Epithelium and glands are **endoderm** derived
Connective tissue and muscle layer are partially derived from **mesoderm**
Striated muscle derived from caudal pharyngeal arches

Outline the formation of the stomach
?
Dorsal and ventral mesogastrium
Dorsal surface grows faster -> greater curvature
Ventral surface grows slower -> lesser curvature
Stomach rotation
- Rotation is that the greater curvature is first to the left and then cauda-ventral
- Enlarged dorsal mesogastrium (**mesoderm**)
- elongates to form the greater omentum

Outline ruminant forestomach embryology
?
Fundic region enlarges, grooves form

Outline the formation of the pancreas
?
Is dervied from 2 primoris
Dorsal primordium from dorsal duodenum -> left lobe
Ventral primordium form hepatic diverticulum -> right lobe
gastric and intestinal rotation causes fusion
Horses/dogs/humans: pancreatic duct from the ventral lobe opens on the major duodenal papilla
The accessory pancreatic duct (from the dorsal lobe) opens on the monitor duodenal papilla
Sheep/goats/cats: Dorsal duct atrophies
Cattle/pigs: Ventral duct atrophies

Outline the formation of small and large intestine
?
The initial gut tube is straight - dorsal/ventral mesenteries
Ventral mesentery degenerates
Dynamic changes
- Hair pin-shaped loop
- Y.S stalk at the tip of the loop
- Psychological umbilical herniation
- Rotation/extensive coaling

Outline midgut rotation
?
Stomach more cranial
During herniation 180 degrees twist to the right about the cranial mesenteric artery
After herniation, there is a 90-degree turn to the right
Ascending colon changes occur at the same time

Outline cloaca and proctodeum
?
Caudal blind ending expansion of hindgut endoderm -> cloaca
Invagination of ectoderm beneath the tail -> proctodeum
Cloacal membrane = endoderm/ectoderm

Outline the division of the cloaca
?
Lateral extensions form the urorectal septum
Separates hindgut/allantois
Extends caudally -> cloacal membrane degenerates
Separate anal/urogenital sinus openings

What is atresia ani::The membranes around the anus do not disappear
