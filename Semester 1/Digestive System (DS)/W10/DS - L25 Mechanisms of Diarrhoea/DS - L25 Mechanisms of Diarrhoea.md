What are some potential causes of diarrhoea?
?
Parasites: whipworms, unicellular protozoa
Viruses: parvo
Bacteria and/or bacterial toxins: leading cause, 
Other toxins: heavy metals
Fungi
Algae
Ischaemia
Sterile inflammation: food hypersensitivity
Neoplasia: lymphoma
Hyperosmolar luminal contents: act as a laxative and draws out water, milk lactose can also draw water out, and VFAs, and fermentation products also draw water. 

What are the potential consequences of diarrhoea?
?
Weight loss (ill thrift)
Electrolyte depletion - sodium, potassium, bicarbonate
Acid-base imbalance - especially metabolic acidosis
Dehydration
Hypovolaemic shock
Death
Albumin lost into the bowel lumen and faeces leads to reduce plasma oncotic pressure which leads to oedema build-up ascites

What are the major sites of water reabsorption?
?
Small intestine - all species
Proximal colon - carnivores
Spiral colon - ruminants and pigs
Small colon - horses

What is the role of crypt cells
?
Control water release via chloride
Controlled via a variety of mechanisms
Will increase in the division due to injuries that cause cell sloughing

Outline small vs large intestine leakiness
?
Small is leaking
Large is non-leaking
The large intestine is hypotonic
The small intestine is isotonic except proximal small intestine which will be hypertonic due to food

Outline oedema release into the bowl
?
Increased capillary pressure will cause oedema in the lamina propria which can release oedema fluid into the bowl lumen
Causes include right-side congested heart failure
Lymphatic obstruction
Only occurs in the small intestine not the large intestine

T/F both the small and large intestines absorb water::True

What is the relation between clinical signs and large intestinal and small intestinal diarrhoea
?

What is haematochezia::Fresh blood in stool typical of large intestinal diarrhoea

What are tenesmus and dyschezia::straining and difficulty pooping

What is Melaena::Black faeces which is indicative of bleeding proximal could be intestines or higher

What are the mechanisms of diarrhoea
?
Hypersecretion
Increased mucosal permeability 
Malabsorption (mainly small intestine)
Osmotic drag
Hypermotility (decreased time for absorption)

Outline hypersecretion (secretory diarrhoea)
?
Secretion outweighs absorption
What are some bacterial species that can cause hypersecretion?
- Enterotoxigenic E. coli ETEC colibacillosis
  - Very common in neonates, cows and pigs and sheep
  - Inadequate colostrum intake
  - The yellowish fluid small intestine, not dominated by inflammation
  - Impairs sodium ion absorption which prevents water absorption on villus enterocytes and their toxin promotes excess secretion of chloride ions which leads to water release into the lumen
  - Heat labile toxins cause hypersecretion via cAMP
  - Heat-stable toxins cause hypersecretion via GMP
- Salmonella
- Yersinia enterocolitica
- Shigella
- Campylobacter jejuni
- Vibrio cholera
- Local release of soluble factors promoting secretion and inhibiting absorption
- Bile salts entering the large intestine (act similar to heat-labile toxins of E coli which causes cAMP release of chloride)

Outline diarrhoea caused by increased mucosal permeability (exudative diarrhoea)
?
Mucosal necrosis, erosion, or ulceration
- Salmonella typhimurium, S choleraesuis, S dublin
- Clostridium perfringens, C difficile
- Brachyspira hyodysenteriae (swine dysentery)
- Ulcerative viral infections - parvovirus, BDV virus
- Cyathostomes (small strongyle nematodes) in horses, pimpley gut, hyperplastic lymphoid tissue, red larvae causing inflammation, breaking out to the luminal surface
- Coccidiosis, multiple within enterocytes
- Ischaemic injury
- Infiltrative intestinal disease - lymphoma, Johne's disease
Oedema of the small intestinal lamina propria
- Right-sided congestive heart failure
- Portal hypertension
- Hypoalbuminaemia
- Lymphatic obstruction (very common in dogs, intestinal lymphangiectasia, creamy white lymphatics)
- Increased vascular permeability due to mucosal inflammation

Outline malabsorption (malabsorptive diarrhoea)
?
Primary maldigestion
- Steatorrhoea: Undigested lipids
- Creatorrhoea: Undigested muscle fibres
- Amylorrhoea: Undigested starch
- Malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K)
- Malabsorption of calcium, magnesium, and zinc
Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency
Achlorhydria or hypochlorhydria (not enough stomach acid)
Gastric hyperacidity (too much acid), mast cell tumours via histamine
Complete bile duct obstruction, tumours, and not enough bile salts
Deficiencies of enterocyte brush border enzymes
Short bowel syndrome - less surface area, can be because of removal of 3/4 or more of the small intestine

Small intestinal villous atrophy - reduced surface area, crypt hypertrophy
?
- Increased loss of enterocytes from villi, virus (rotaviral, coronaviruses worse because they attack further down, more profound diarrhoea)
- Coxydia, protozoa
- Cryptosporidium, protozoa
- Ischemia
  - Hypoxia (as low as 5-10 minutes)
  - Hypoxia of 2-4 hours will wipe out crypt cells
Necrosis or impaired mitosis of crypt stem cells
  - Parvovirus which affects the crypt stem cells
  - Survivors may never reach full length again
  - BVD virus in cattle does the same thing and also targets lymphoid cells in payer's patches
Dysregulation of crypt stem cell proliferation and enterocyte maturation
- Inflammatory bowel disease
- Johne's disease
- Lymphoma
- Giardia
