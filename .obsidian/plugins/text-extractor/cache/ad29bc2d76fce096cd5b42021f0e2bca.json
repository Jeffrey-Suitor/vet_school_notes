Animal welfare An animal’s state as regards its attempts to cope with its environment. This state includes how much it is having to do to cope, the extent to which it is succeeding in or failing to cope, and its associated feelings. Welfare will vary over a continuum from very good to very poor. Donald Broom, Cambridge University Animal welfare means how an animal is coping with the conditions in which it lives. An animal is in a good state of welfare if (as indicated by scientific evidence) it is healthy, comfortable, well nourished, safe, able to express innate behaviour, and if it is not suffering from unpleasant states such as pain, fear and distress. Good animal welfare requires disease prevention and veterinary treatment, appropriate shelter, management, nutrition, humane handling and humane slaughter/killing. Animal welfare refers to the state of the animal; the treatment that an animal receives is covered by other terms such as animal care, animal husbandry, and humane treatment.

Animal welfarist point of view the position that it is morally acceptable for humans to use non-human animals, provided that adverse effects on animal welfare are minimized as far as possible. Clearly, positions can vary on what is acceptable! Jeremy Bentham: Utilitarian the question is not, Can they reason? nor, Can they talk? but, Can they suffer? Utilitarianism :the right course of action is the one that maximizes the overall \"good\" consequences of the action. It is a form of ‘consequentialism’, meaning that the moral worth of an action is determined by its resulting outcome. What philosophies underpin animal welfare? Peter Singer: Utilitarian Equal consideration of similar interests What philosophies underpin animal welfare? https://thinkinc.org.au/ Tom Regan, Professor emeritus of philosophy at North Carolina State University: Animal rights Animals are \"subjects-of-a-life,\" who have moral rights for that reason, and that moral rights ought not to be ignored. Gary Francione, Professor of law and philosophy at Rutgers School of Law Animals have one moral right, and need one legal one: the right not to be regarded as property. All else will follow. What philosophies underpin animal welfare?Animal welfare and animal rights • Animal welfare – the concern for an animal’s wellbeing, associated with the concept that animals should be humanely treated and not unnecessarily suffer • Typically accepting of some animal utilisation by humans • Positions may vary on exactly what is acceptable • Animal rights – a philosophical position that animals have inherent moral rights • Animal utilisation by humans contravenes the rights of animals • If animals consent to live with us (by their actions) than that can be ok • Both positions can agree on the need to improve animal treatment, but tend to differ in their end goals Animal welfare and animal rights • Animal welfare – the concern for an animal’s wellbeing, associated with the concept that animals should be humanely treated and not unnecessarily suffer • Typically accepting of some animal utilisation by humans • Positions may vary on exactly what is acceptable • Animal rights – a philosophical position that animals have inherent moral rights • Animal utilisation by humans contravenes the rights of animals • If animals consent to live with us (by their actions) than that can be ok • Both positions can agree on the need to improve animal treatment, but tend to differ in their end goals Current concepts • Checklists • Animal welfare as a biological state • Animal feelings Checklists Five Freedoms (FAWC, 1993) Freedom from thirst, hunger and malnutrition Freedom from discomfort Freedom from pain, injury and disease Freedom to express normal behaviour Freedom from fear and distress Checklists Five Obligations (NZ Animal Welfare) Proper and sufficient food and water Adequate shelter The opportunity to display normal patterns of behaviour Appropriate physical handling Protection from, and rapid diagnosis of, injury and disease.
