Bovine ketosis • Pathophysiology • Intense demand of early lactation → negative energy balance • Peak energy demand 4-7 weeks post-calving • Peak feed intake 8-12 weeks post-calving But the cow had access to lush pasture… Bovine ketosis • Negative energy balance (dominance of glucagon) • Glycogen stores depleted • Protein breakdown for gluconeogenesis • FFAs released into circulation • Overwhelm TCA cycle • Oxaloacetate diverted to gluconeogenesis • Acetyl-CoA converted to ketone bodies by liver Bovine ketosis • Treatment • Provide glucose • Intravenous bolus/infusion • Short term but immediate improvement • Provide gluconeogenic substrate • Propylene glycol • Converted to pyruvate (propionate) • Address energy drain if possible • (Corticosteroids?)
