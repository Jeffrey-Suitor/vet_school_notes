Lecture 3: Intended learning outcomesCardiovascular System • The heart - the driving force propels blood around the body • Arterial system the distribution channels • The microcirculation the exchange vessels • The venous system the blood reservoirs, return blood to the heart Lectures 3&4: How does a heart ‘beat’? Lecture 3: - Action potentials in cardiac myocytes: how are they generated and coordinated? - Autorhymicity: how the heart ‘beats’ - Autonomic nervous system control of HR Lecture 4: - Mechanical activity of the heart - How the electrical activity links to mechanical activity - Cardiac muscle cell performance (contractility) Electrical Activity of the Heart: how does the heart ‘beat’? - Contraction is triggered by action potentials (AP) sweeping across the cell membrane - The heart beats rhythmically due to AP it generates itself – this property is called ‘autorhythmicity’ - Two specialised types of cells: 1. Contractile cardiac muscle cells: do the mechanical work of pumping . They do not normally initiate their own AP 2. Autorhythmic (‘pacemaker’) cells: specialised for initiating and conducting the AP that contract the contractile cardiac muscle cells. They do not contract. We will first look at action potentials in the contractile cardiac muscle cells Contractile Cardiomyocyte: resting potential Key idea: All cells have an electrical potential across their membranes, caused by separation of electrical charges across the membrane https://www.magonlinelibrary.com/doi/abs/10.12968/bjca.2015.10.3.140 In cardiac muscle cells: - Fixed proteins (negative charge) inside the cell - Cell membrane permeable to K+ ions - these move freely to balance change - Balance of K+ is controlled by opposing electrical and concentration gradients - This creates the membrane potential (Nernst equation): - 90 mV Resting membrane potential depends on differing K+ concentrations across the membrane Proteins(-ve) Proteins(-ve) Proteins(-ve) Cardiomyocyte: resting potential • Resting membrane potential dependent differing K+ concentrations across the membrane • Ion channels can be receptor or voltage-operated • Voltage operated: • Controlled by changes in membrane potential • Na+ channels involved in generation of AP • Once channel is open, ions enter passively down concentration gradient https://www.magonlinelibrary.com/doi/abs/10.12968/bjca.2015.10.3.140 Proteins(-ve) Proteins(-ve) Proteins(-ve) Voltage operated Na channel Berne and Levy Physiol Rev. 2005 Oct;85(4):1205-53 Refractory period: a special feature of cardiac myocytes • AP are long – one AP per contraction • Extended absolute refractory state • Voltage-operated Na+ channels inactivated at the end of Phase 0; → they cannot reactivate until membrane potential drops Why is this important? - Cardiac muscle cannot be restimulated until contraction is almost over - Sustained maximal contraction ‘tetanus’ cannot occur - Pumping blood requires alternate phases of contraction (emptying) and relaxation (filling) Refractory period: a special feature of cardiac myocytes Electrical Activity of the Heart: how does the heart ‘beat’? - Contraction is triggered by action potentials (AP) sweeping across the cell membrane - The heart beats rhythmically due to AP it generates itself – this property is called ‘autorhythmicity’ - Two specialised types of cells: 1. Contractile cardiac muscle cells: do the mechanical work of pumping . They do not normally initiate their own AP 2. Autorhythmic (‘pacemaker’) cells: specialised for initiating and conducting the AP that contract the contractile cardiac muscle cells. They do not contract. Cardiac autorhythmic cells display pacemaker activity - The heart contracts as a result of AP it generates itself - This ‘autothythmicity’ is a function of specialised pacemaker cells - They initiate AP that spread through the heart to trigger rhythmic beating (without nervous stimulation) Sherwood 2015 Cardiac autorhythmic cells display pacemaker activity Autorhythmic ‘pacemaker’ cells are located in: 1. Sinoatrial node (SA node): located in right atrial wall 2. Atrioventricular node (AV node): located at base of right atrium 3. Bundle of His: originates at the AV node, enters the IV septum, then divides into left and right bundle branches 4. Purkinje fibres: small terminal fibres that extend from bundle of His Sherwood 2015 Pacemaker cell action potentials - Pacemaker cells do not have a constant ‘resting potential’ - Their membrane potential slowly depolarises (drifts) between action potentials - Cyclically initiate Aps that are conducted through the heart to trigger rhythmic beating – with no nervous stimulation! Sherwood 2015 Pacemaker cell action potentials ‘Fast’ and ‘Slow’ action potentials Key differences: • Slow depolarisation • Shorter plateau • Unstable resting potential • No voltage-operated Na+ channels • Threshold for depolarisation is more positive (due to dependence on voltage operated Ca2+ channels) • Permeability to K+ does not remain constant between APs The sinoatrial node is the pacemaker of the heart - Autorhythmic tissues exhibit different rates of depolarisation SA node > AV Node > Bundle of His > Purkinje Fibres - Tissues with faster rate of depolarisation generate action potentials more frequently - Cells in the SA node have the fastest rate of AP initiation - AP are transmitted through the conduction system and via gap junctions (more about these soon!) to the rest of the myocardium - SA node is the pacemaker of the heart – the entire heart beats at the pace set by the SA node! Sherwood 2016 The rate set by the SA node is called the SINUS RHYTHM Sherwood 2016 Anatomy of the conducting system of the heart 1. Sinoatrial node (SA node): in the right atrial wall 2. Atrioventricular node (AV node): located at base of right atrium 3. Bundle of His: originates at the AV node, enters the IV septum, then divides into left and right bundle branches 4. Purkinje fibres: small terminal fibres that extend from bundle of His All are comprised of modified cardiac muscle cells Anatomy of the conducting system of the heart SA node • Lateral wall of RA • Near junction of CrVC • Mass of nodal myocytes • Microscopic AV node • Floor of RA , at junction of interatrial septum • Microscopic Bundle of His/ Atrioventricular (AV) Bundle: Runs from AV node to dorsal IV septum Immediately divides into R and L branches Right crus (also called R bundle branch): • Runs to the apex in the subendocardium of the IV septum • Branches to papillary muscles, outer wall of R ventricle Left crus (L bundle branch): • Subendocardial branches over surface of L ventricle • Runs to the apex, up the outer wall of L ventricle • Papillary muscles on outer wall Purkinje fibres: • Final extensions of R & L bundle branches • Network of subendocardial fibres • Fibre bundles enclosed in CT • Fibres pass into cardiac muscle cells Conducting System Histology Purkinje cells • Specialised cardiac myocytes, not nerve cells • Large diameter • Pale central area (glycogen) • Marginalisation of myofibrils around periphery • Chains of Purkinje cells make Purkinje fibres Cardiac muscle fibres are connected by intercalated disks • Cardiac muscle cells are connected to form branching fibres • Adjacent cells joined by intercalated discs Within an intercalated disc, there are two types of membrane junctions: - Desmosome – mechanically holds cells together - Gap junction- areas that allow action potentials to spread quickly between cells • Impulses generated in one part of the heart spread quickly across the heart • Conduction velocity varies across the different tissues – slower through AV node All the cells contract or none do – no ‘half-hearted’ contraction!! Sherwood 2016 Control of heart rate • SA node depolarises independently • Heart rate is influenced by neural and hormonal factors • Heart is innovated by both divisions of the autonomic nervous system - Sympathetic stimulation will ↑HR - Parasympathetic stimulation (vagus nerve) will ↓HR • Circulating adrenaline (hormonal factor) also increases HR Effect of sympathetic stimulation - Increased rate of depolarisation in SA node → ↓time to reach threshold - Increases inwards movement of Na+ and Ca2+ - Also increases contractile strength; so both HR and force of contraction increase - Sympathetic activity dominates during exercise or during emergency situations Sherwood 2016 Effect of parasympathetic stimulation • Parasympathetic stimulation ↑ permeability to K+ in the SA node – ↑ K+ leaving the cell – longer time to reach threshold • Mediated by ACh-regulated K+ channels • Parasympathetic action dominates at rest • HR determined by the balance of sympathetic & parasympathetic effects • At rest, parasympathetic is dominant • Activity of these two branches of the autonomic nervous system is controlled at the CV control centre in the brainstem • Note: adrenaline (hormone secreted by the adrenal gland) also increases heart rate – this reinforces the effect of the sympathetic nervous system on the heart Lecture 3: Intended learning outcomes At the end of this lecture you should be able to: − Describe how the resting membrane potential is created in cardiac myocytes. − Explain the ionic changes that occur during action potentials in contractile cardiac myocytes and pacemaker cells, including a description of the differences between these − Identify the refractory period of the cardiac cell electrical cycle, and explain the functional significance of this − Describe the structural organisation of the pacemaker and conducting tissues of the heart and the normal pathway of action potential conduction through the heart. − Describe how cardiac sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves alter heart rate and conduction of cardiac action potentials.","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
