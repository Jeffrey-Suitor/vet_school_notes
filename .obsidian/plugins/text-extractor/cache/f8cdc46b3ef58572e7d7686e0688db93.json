The guidelines set down below should assist with this. • Students are expected to prepare for each class beforehand by reviewing the relevant sections of recommended texts, revising relevant lecture notes, and watching any preparatory video tutorials. • For dissections (e.g. dog abdomen), the dissection tables in the laboratory are allocated to students in groups. Student groups will be posted in the room and on the LMS. Where otherwise notified, demonstration wetlabs may involve larger groups of up to 15 students rotating around various stations. • Dissections should be carried out carefully and thoroughly. These classes are intended to help you consolidate and expand on the information given in the lecture course - use this time wisely. These classes will also help you develop dexterity in dissection and instrument handling. • The dissection laboratory might on occasion be available outside scheduled class times for students that wish to revise material.1 Contact James Adamu to request extra dissection material; groups of 3-6 students should be assembled. It is required that during all dissection classes students DO the following: • Follow all temporal COVID Safe measures. • Wear laboratory coats with your name clearly displayed. • Wear shoes which cover the upper surface of the foot and that are made of leather or similar, or if canvas have shoelaces, to provide protection from falling sharps. Canvas slip-on shoes do not provide sufficient protection. • Wear gloves. Every endeavour is made to ensure that fresh specimens are free from disease, but this may not always be the case. Gloves are provided for your protection and must be worn. • Tablets such as iPads may be used in the dissection lab but must be covered with the clear plastic film provided before they can be used in class. This film must be discarded at the end of the class. • Take due care when using sharp instruments for dissection. • Scalpel blades will be provided. Dispose of used/broken sharps in the correct receptacles. • Dispose of unwanted tissues in the buckets under the tables or in bins as indicated during the classes. • Buckets containing discarded tissues should be emptied into bins at the end of each practical session. • Replace stools under tables after each class and clean the tables (sponges and paper towels are available at the sinks). • Report any personal injuries to a staff member in attendance. Unfortunately, there are some DONT’S: • Don’t eat or drink in the laboratory. • Photography or video or audio recording is not permitted in the dissection lab at any time. • Don’t bring library books into the laboratory, limited copies of texts are available in the laboratory. If you have to refer to library texts then these should be left in the Object Based Learning Area (OBLA) for use during the classes. • The textbooks that have been provided are for use within the dissection lab and are not to be taken out of the lab. Gloves must be removed and hands clean when using these textbooks. • Don’t remove animal tissues from the laboratory; tissues must be disposed of by staff for reasons of health and safety. • Care must be exercised at all times when in the dissection laboratory for your own and others safety. Inappropriate (unsafe) behaviour will not be tolerated. • Visitors are not permitted in the dissection laboratory or OBLA. • Compliance with the above would be appreciated; failure to do so may lead to a demand to leave the class. 1 Outside of scheduled class times, veterinary students might be able to access the WEBS Dissection lab upon request between the hours of 8.30am and 5.30pm. However, students must have permission to enter the preparatory areas adjacent to the lab. Permission is also required to enter the cold room and to open the formalin tanks.","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
