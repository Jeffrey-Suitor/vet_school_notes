Do not jump ahead. • This file gives you detailed instructions for completing each activity. Ask your tutor if you have any questions. • For some activities, you will be asked to record your answers to the questions by typing them into this file. You should save this PDF file each time you complete one of these questions, to make sure that your work does not get lost. Guidelines for effective Group work Your group will work at its best when everyone feels comfortable and “safe” to contribute to discussion. Here are a few suggestions that might help promote a safe and effective group work environment: • Ensure that you all know one another’s names- and that you use them during your conversations. • Effective listening is a key to effective group work. Respectful listening enhances a positive group dynamic, and creates a space where it is safe for all to contribute. • Taking time to discuss is really important- discussing involves questioning and responding, reviewing and reflecting, sharing understanding. This is where deep learning occurs. It can often be greatly enhanced by visualisation- by sharing of ideas, summaries and processes on your white board and by collective rephrasing and reframing of ideas. • Sharing of tasks and responsibilities is also important in group work. Perhaps make a roster and each week have a different group member take responsibility for the keyboard, and for completing your interactive pdf. 3 instructions Enter each group member’s name, Iand email address below.

GROUP NUMBER Name Email Address 4 triGGer You are helping out in reception in a mixed practice in West Gippsland, when you receive a phone call from Janette Green, a long-standing client of the practice. “I’m getting a bit worried about Misty, our old pony”, she says. “She always used to be so fat, that we had to lock her up for most of the year. Now there’s lots of grass around but she’s getting really skinny. I’m scared there’s something really wrong with her.” You speak to the consulting vet, Matt Stevens. He agrees to visit Mrs Green the following day during his farm rounds. He asks you to “get a few more details” from Mrs Green. DISCUSSION TOPICS What further information might you obtain from the clinic data-base or from Mrs Green before the planned visit? How would you describe Misty’s presenting problem? 5 QUESTION 1 • In the box below, list the key information about Misty. (Key information is all the information that may be relevant in assessing her current condition- including information about Misty’s signalment, her present condition and anything relevant that her owners have told you) • How would you describe Misty’s presenting problem or problems? • Think about possible causes for these problems. Which body systems might be involved? • What further information, that might be obtained from history questions, do you require to help you decide between your hypotheses? Make a list of these questions, explain your reasoning for asking questions for each identified cause. 6 history The next afternoon you visit the Green’s hobby farm with Matt. On the way there you inform Matt that Misty is 33 years old, and has been part of the Green family since she was 12 years old. Clinic records indicate that she is a registered Welsh Mountain pony, was previously a brood mare, and has had several foals. Over almost a decade between five and fifteen years ago, the clinic had attended Misty on several occasions for recurrent lameness due to laminitis (founder). This was medicated with PBZ granules (phenylbutazone oral). Misty has been wormed regularly with a broad spectrum anthelminthic paste. You also tell him that Mrs Green explained to you that for many years her four children used to take Misty to Pony Club, but that they are now all adults. Misty is now retired, except for the occasional leading ride offered to visiting grand children. As you drive in to the property, Misty is in a paddock beside the drive, and Mrs Greens’ grandson Scott is feeding her apricots from a nearby tree. You observe the pasture in Misty’s paddock. It is an improved perennial rye/ clover paddock with some trefoil and invasive weeds. Mrs Green meets you at your car and as you move to the yard, Misty follows you down the paddock. She is bright, alert and moves easily. DISCUSSION QUESTION What information can you obtain from your initial observation of Misty? 7 QUESTION 2 • Are there any terms that you do not understand? List these below and find explanations for them. • Summarise the additional information about Misty obtained from the history and your initial observations. • Copy your problem list from Question 1 and adapt it incorporating the new information. Are there any new problems you would like to add? Can you exclude any of your previous hypotheses? • Add to the list of possible causes for each identified problem. (At this stage these possible causes are just hypotheses - you will need more information in order to reach a definitive diagnosis). Where possible assign an organ system to each of these possible causes. 8 physical (objective) assessment In your discussion you may have come up with a range of possible hypotheses to explain Misty’s weight loss- you may have discussed these from a mechanistic point of view - e.g. insufficient intake of food, failure to absorb food, poor nutrient quality of food, or you may have considered causes in terms of possible causative agents (e.g. worm infestation, poisoning… too many apricots?, cancer somewhere). Further information obtained by a physical (objective) examination may help you to refine your hypotheses. Matt invites you to conduct a physical examination of Misty. You make the following observations. Cardiovascular system • Heart rate 42 bpm • Mucous membranes pink • Capillary refill time 1 second • Pulse regular and strong Digestive system • Normal gut sounds • Faeces normal colour and consistency • No evidence of diarrhoea (tail clean) • Teeth - evidence of significant wearing of incisors (refer to photos below) General body condition • Thin-ribs, spine of scapula and pelvic tuberosities visible • Well groomed Integument • Coat good • Hooves trimmed and in good condition Body temperature • 38°C 9 View the videoclip below of a young horse eating. Misty the Pony Horse eating grass QUESTION 3 • Go through the results of the physical examination and note any abnormal results. • How would the state of Misty’s teeth affect her capacity to eat? How would the length of grass in her paddock affect this capacity? • What role do the incisors of the horse play in prehension and mastication? • Which further examination(s) do you suggest? 10 further physical examination Given the state of Misty’s incisors, Matt decides that further investigation of Misty’s dentition is required. He asks you to restrain her and places a gag on her mouth. DISCUSSION QUESTIONS • Do you think the gag will cause her much discomfort? Why? Hint: Are there any physiological functions that she cannot perform whilst the gag is fitted and her mouth is open? • You are now able to examine her mouth in more detail. Watch the three video clips linked below, and discuss your observations of her mouth and teeth. • https://vimeo.com/297223166/4446cc24ee • https://vimeo.com/297223144/7766a997c2 • https://vimeo.com/297223126/399483ed40 11 • View the three photos (below) of defleshed skulls of three old horses (after watching the videoclips above). What characteristics of Misty’s dentition can you see in each of these horses? 12 QUESTION 4 • Describe Misty’s dentition. Use terms such as hooks, sharp edges, steps and waves, where appropriate and include the directional terms for teeth to describe the location. If you are unsure of any of these terms, list them and find explanations. • Explain in some detail how her dentition may affect her capacity to eat. How does this lead to weight loss? • Discuss with your group any further investigation that you believe are required to investigate Misty’s weight loss and how you would suggest managing Misty’s weight loss. Record your suggestions below. QUIZ 1 Click back to the LMS and attempt Quiz 1 before continuing. 13 manaGement Matt explains to Mrs Green that the very poor state and extreme wear of Misty’s teeth would be sufficient cause for Misty’s poor body condition and weight loss. He explains that it is also possible that Misty has some other disease of an internal organ and that a blood test might help to rule out chronic inflammatory disease or disease associated with her liver or kidneys. Mrs Green agrees to Matt obtaining a blood sample from Misty’s jugular vein. Matt advises Mrs Green that there is nothing that can be done to improve Misty’s problem teeth- but that changes to her diet will enable her to overcome some of the problems she is experiencing with prehension and mastication of food. This will mean that she should derive more nutrients from the food she ingests. Matt recommends that Misty be commenced on “hard feed” twice a day. He suggests that she be fed 1 dipper of lucerne chaff, 1 dipper of Gumnuts Mitavite™ and one third of a dipper of rice pollard (see photos below), mixed and moistened with a little water. As you leave he asks Mrs Green to ring the clinic after the weekend to hear the results of the blood tests. 14 Information about the protein, carbohydrate and calcium/phosphorous ratio of each of these foods is available at the following websites: • http://www.mitavite.com/gumnuts • https://app.lms.unimelb.edu.au/bbcswebdav/xid-51258368_4 You may like to review this information later in your private study. QUESTION 5 • Given your understanding of the problem’s that Misty has with her dentition, what do you think might be the benefits of the “hard feed” that Matt has recommended? As you walk to the car Mrs Green tells you that she used to have a horse dentist come and file Misty’s teeth. “Last time he came he pulled out a tooth that he said was loose- has that made things worse for her?” she asks. “No, I don’t believe so.” says Matt, “if it were loose enough for him to take out in a standing pony, I suspect it may have fallen out anyway.” QUIZ 2 Click back to the LMS and attempt Quiz 2 before continuing. 15 further examination (a) A few days later Mrs Green rings the clinic and again you take her call. “I’m ringing about the blood tests” she says, “but it’s not just that. She’s got a big lump now on the side of her face – I’ve no idea what it can be”. You arrange to revisit the next morning and retrieve the blood results in preparation for the visit. You have no experience reading pathology results, but Matt assures you that there is nothing in these results to suggest something other than poor dentition as the cause of Misty’s weight loss. When you arrive Misty is about to be fed. She has a large soft swelling over the maxilla below her right eye. She is bright, active and eager to be feed. QUESTION 6 • What structures and tissues are present in this region? • What possible causes of the swelling can you suggest? 16 further examination (b) Matt then examines Misty’s face and looks inside her mouth. He extracts several balls of grass (see photo below) from her right cheek pouch … and the ‘lump’ immediately disappears. “Oh, it’s only grass” says Mrs Green. “I really thought it was the end for her this time!” When you look around the paddock you find many similar balls of grass that have presumably been spat out by Misty (see photo below). Matt tells you that this process is sometimes referred to as quidding. You examine the grass balls, paying particular attention to the fibre length of the grass portions in these grass balls She then feeds Misty whilst you stand and chat. Watch the video of Misty eating. Misty the Pony Misty’s eating 17 QUESTION 7 • Record your observations of Misty’s ability to prehend and masticate food. • Would you expect horses to cut grass into shorter lengths than is the case in the grass extruded from Misty’s mouth? Discuss how the length of grass influences the energy uptake in horses. • Discuss the mechanism behind ‘quidding’ in Misty’s case taking the state of her dentition into account? Do you think this problem relates to her incisor function or her molar function, or both? 18 further examination Some months later (when you are back at uni) Matt is called again to see Misty, late on a Sunday evening. Mrs Green has been away for the weekend and had turned Misty out into the paddock as there is nobody available to give her supplementary hard feed. On her return, Misty is standing in the paddock and doesn’t move to the yard as her food is prepared. Her head is hanging down and copious amounts of clear liquid are dribbling from her mouth; there is a frothy white discharge streaming from both nostrils. Misty the Pony Horse symptoms DISCUSSION QUESTIONS • How urgent does this situation appear to be? If you had taken her call, would you have advised Mrs Green that: (a) you would arrange an appointment for the following morning (b) she should give Misty plenty of water and observe her overnight (c) she should call back if the condition does not resolve in the next 48 hours (d) you would arrange a vet to examine her immediately • What are the possible sources of the discharge from the mouth? • What are the possible sources of the frothy discharge from the nares? • What hypotheses can you suggest to explain her new presenting problem? • What advice would you have given to Mrs Green regarding management of Misty before the vet arrived? Matt performs a clinical examination. His observations are recorded below: Cardiovascular system • Heart rate 52 bpm • Mucous membranes pink • Capillary refill time < 2 seconds • Pulse regular and strong Respiratory system • Respiratory rate 15 per minute • Frothy grass stained fluid discharge from both nares Digestive system • Normal gut sounds • Faeces normal colour and consistency • No evidence of diarrhoea (tail clean) • Viscous fluid discharge from mouth resembling saliva Body temperature • 38°C Although there are no photos of Misty’s condition, Matt shows you a movie clip of a previous horse that presented with similar signs. 19 QUESTION 8 • Are there any terms that you do not understand? List these below and find explanations for them. • Summarise the additional information about Misty obtained from this consultation. Highlight all abnormal results of the physical exam. • Discuss the mechanism leading to foamy nasal discharge. How does it differ from serous and mucoid discharge? Can you think of a reason why it is foamy? • Add the current acute problem to Misty’s problem list. • On the basis of the information that you have obtained through the history, and this recent examination, can you suggest a new hypothesis to explain Misty’s current condition? • What steps could you take to confirm this hypothesis? • What risks to the horse might be associated with leaving this condition unattended? 20 TREATMENT These clinical findings suggest to Matt that Misty has ‘choke’, an obstruction in the oesophagus, somewhere between the pharynx and the cardiac sphincter. Matt sedates Misty, and after administering the spasmolytic Buscopan and attempts to pass a nasogastric tube. It passes easily through the pharynx but at a point that seems to correspond to the level of the diaphragm its passage is impeded. With gentle pressure and instillation of some warm water into the tube, the blockage is eased and he is able to advance the tube into the stomach.The discharge from her mouth and nose ceases almost at once. Before he leaves, Matt administers 2 litres of warmed fluids via the stomach tube. DISCUSSION QUESTIONS • Based on your knowledge of the structure and relationships of the oesophagus, where do you think an obstruction is most likely to occur? • Draw a schematic diagram of the pharynx on your whiteboard. If you are unsure, refer to your lecture notes or online sources for guidance. Use this diagram to discuss how oesophageal content and saliva came out of Misty’s nasal passage. • Does your drawing also help you to explain why the stomach tube is not passed down through the mouth? • In cows, rumen fluid can be collected by passing a tube through the nasal or oral cavity. Can you explain why this is possible based on anatomical differences between the two species? • What evidence could be used to establish that the tube is in the stomach? • One of the active ingredients of Buscopan is a drug called hyoscine, that binds to cholinergic receptors and blocks the action of acetyl choline. Can you predict how this drug will affect oesophageal function? • The sedative that Matt chooses to give Misty is also a muscle relaxant. What are the benefits of administering sedatives in this situation? QUIZ 3 Click back to the LMS and attempt Quiz 3 before continuing. 21 outcome Misty makes an uneventful recovery and by the next morning is eating normally again. Matt advises Mrs Green that the state of Misty’s dentition means that she cannot masticate effectively and that she is likely to choke again if she is allowed to eat significant amounts of grass. However, as the obstruction has been relieved without delay and obstructing material was not abrasive and should not have damaged the epithelium of the oesophagus, he reassures her that there should not be any scarring of her oesophagus amd that the likelihood of further episodes should not have been increased by this event. Six months later Misty has gained a small amount of weight and has suffered no further episodes of choke. QUESTION 9 Summarise the mechanism of choke in Misty’s case, using a simple flow diagram or list. 22 UPLOAD INSTRUCTIONS You have completed the case study.
