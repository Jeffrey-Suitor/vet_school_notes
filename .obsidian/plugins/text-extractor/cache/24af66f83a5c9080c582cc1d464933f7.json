Organs within the abdominal cavity are covered by reflections of the parietal peritoneum, termed the visceral peritoneum, and these organs are termed intraperitoneal. It is important to recognize that the term intraperitoneal does not imply within the perito- neal cavity, only that the organ is covered by visceral peritoneum. The space between the parietal and visceral peritoneal layers is the peritoneal cavity. Normally, there is nothing within the peritoneal cavity except a small amount of fluid to serve as a lubricant. Organs located near the wall of the abdominal cavity, such as a kidney, which are only partially covered by peritoneum are termed retroperitoneal. Radiographic visualization of abdominal organs re- quires the presence of normal surrounding fat to provide contrast. Fat provides enhanced visualization of the edge of abdominal organs, because of its lower physical den- sity and lower effective atomic number, making it slightly more radiolucent than soft tissue (Figure 7-2). The radio- graphically visible margin of abdominal organs created by the adjacent fat is termed the serosal margin. Normal fat deposits in the abdominal cavity include fat in the mesentery, omentum, retroperitoneal space, and in the falciform ligament. Fat in the mesentery and omentum is intraperitoneal while fat in the retroperitoneal space and falciform ligament is extraperitoneal. A misconcep- tion is that the falciform ligament is intraperitoneal. However, the falciform ligament is formed by the two layers of the ventral aspect of the mesogastrum, making it extraperitoneal. 2 The radiographic opacity of all fat within the abdomi- nal cavity should be similar. However, a difference between the opacity of intraperitoneal fat, as in the omentum or mesentery, and extraperitoneal fat, as in the retroperitoneal space or falciform ligament, can be a hint as to the existence of intraperitoneal versus extraperito- neal disease, such as fluid or inflammation. 3 A relative lack of fat in the abdominal cavity, as seen in emaciated animals, reduces the conspicuity of the serosal margin of abdominal organs because without interposed fat the adjacent tissues have the same or nearly the same radiographic opacity, leading to border efface- ment (Figure 7-3). In addition to serosal margin conspi- cuity being reduced by lack of fat, it is also reduced in very young patients (Figure 7-4). It has been theorized that intra-abdominal fat in young patients may be more hydrated than fat in adults, thus increasing its opacity and decreasing its ability to provide radiographic contrast. 4 Cats, particularly those in a state of positive caloric balance, can accumulate massive amounts of fat in the abdominal cavity, especially in the retroperitoneal space and in the falciform ligament (Figures 7-5 and 7-6). Fat in the falciform ligament can create a large mass effect in the cranioventral aspect of the abdominal cavity, and is sometimes misinterpreted as peritoneal effusion by Standard radiographic views of the abdomen include lateral and ventrodorsal (VD) views. Dorsoventral (DV) views of the abdomen are characterized by distortion of the caudal aspect of the abdominal cavity created by pressure from the position of the pelvic limbs and as a result are rarely made. In general, abdominal radiographs should be made without fasting or administering an enema. This way the image represents the natural status of the gastrointestinal tract, which can be important for making the diagnosis. All figures in this chapter are of patients for which no special preparation was undertaken prior to radiography. Gas is usually present in the some portion of the gastrointestinal tract, and the distribution of this gas is very important in formulating a correct interpretation. Obtaining both right lateral and left lateral radiographs in addition to the VD view is recommended for all abdominal radiographic examinations because the distri- bution of gas in opposing lateral views will be different and can provide important diagnostic information. In other words, gas is acting like an endogenous contrast medium.* Left versus right recumbency also influences the radiographic appearance of some other organs, notably the spleen and kidneys. The effect of left versus right lateral recumbency on the normal radiographic appear- ance of the abdomen will be illustrated for the stomach, spleen, and kidneys. Pulling the pelvic limbs caudally for lateral and VD views should be avoided. In the VD view, pulling the pelvic limbs caudally leads to skin folds, which create linear opacities that will interfere with assessment of the caudal aspect of the abdomen. It is preferable to flex the pelvic limbs for the VD radiograph so that the caudal aspect of the abdominal wall is not taut but is relaxed with greater lateral expansion and less crowding (Figure 7-1). In lateral view, the femurs should be approximately perpendicular to the lumbar spine. Pulling the femurs caudally causes crowding of the caudal abdomen and pushing them cranially leads to them being superim- posed on the abdomen. A brief review of abdominal anatomy is needed to understand the terminology used in this atlas. 1 The abdomen is the part of the trunk extending from the diaphragm to the pelvis, and it contains the abdominal cavity, which is contiguous with the pelvic cavity. The abdominal and pelvic cavities are lined by the parietal *A contrast medium is a substance that is used to enhance the contrast between structures in images. Most contrast media are exogenous, being administered parenterally or intravenously. Gas in the bowel can be considered an endogenous contrast medium, and its change in location as a function of body posi- tion will alter the contrast of different portions of the gastroin- testinal tract. This can be extremely helpful from a diagnostic standpoint. Chapter 7 n The Abdomen 243 Figure 7-1. Ventrodorsal radiographs from two dogs. In A, the pelvic limbs are flexed, allow- ing relaxation of the caudal abdominal muscles and greater expansion of the caudal aspect of the abdomen. In B, the pelvic limbs are pulled caudally, creating skin folds (solid white arrows) that interfere with interpretation, and the caudal aspect of the abdominal cavity is narrower and more crowded. Also in B, the edge of the positioning trough has created a linear opacity (solid black arrows) that will also interfere with interpretation. The edge of positioning devices should not be included in the primary x-ray beam. BA Figure 7-2.

BA 244 Atlas of Normal Radiographic Anatomy and Anatomic Variants in the Dog and Cat Figure 7-3. Lateral radiographs of a 16-year-old domestic cat (A) and a 2-year-old Basenji (B). The conspicuity of the serosal margin of abdominal organs in each patient is poor due to a thin body condition leading to a lack of intraperitoneal and extraperitoneal fat to provide contrast. Lack of abdominal fat compromises radiographic assessment of the abdomen. A B Figure 7-4. Lateral radiograph of an 11-week-old Golden Retriever. Conspicuity of serosal margins is diminished due to a relative lack of abdominal fat; this is a common finding in young animals. Margin visualization is, however, better than in patients that are in thin body condition (compare with Figure 7-3). Figure 7-5. Right lateral radiograph of an 8-year-old domestic cat. There is a large collection of fat in the cranioventral aspect of the abdomen (solid black arrowheads) that is causing dorsal displacement of the liver and caudal displacement of the small bowel. This fat, which is in the falciform ligament, is sometimes misinterpreted by inexperienced observers as peritoneal fluid. This cannot be fluid, however, due to its lower radiographic opacity than adjacent soft tissue organs. Fluid would cause border effacement of liver and bowel. This cat also has abun- dant fat in the retroperitoneal space surrounding the kidneys and in the inguinal region. Chapter 7 n The Abdomen 245 normal range of the gastric axis in lateral radiographs is only a guideline, and slight deviation in the position of the gastric axis outside of the accepted normal range can be encountered when there is no pathologic liver abnormality. Another commonly used criterion for liver size in lateral radiographs is extension of the liver beyond the costal arch, which is formed by the border of the last few costal cartilages. However, the costal arch is not a precise demarcation between a normal liver and an enlarged liver, and it cannot be used as a definitive landmark to assess liver size. It is important to recognize that a normal liver can extend beyond the costal arch (Figure 7-8). Unfortunately, the cutoff point between a normal liver and an enlarged liver based on extension beyond the costal arch is vague. Another situation in which a normal liver might extend beyond the costal arch is a distended stomach placing pressure on the liver and causing its ventral aspect to slide caudally beyond the costal arch (Figure 7-9). A change in shape to the margin of the portion of the liver that extends caudal to the costal arch from a gradual taper (see Figures 7-7, A, and 7-8, A) to a more rounded configuration is another finding often associated with liver enlargement. In a deep-chested dog (such as an Afghan Hound or Collie), the gastric axis is normally more perpendicular. In contrast, the gastric axis in a shallow-chested dog (such as a Pug or a Bulldog) is typically angled more caudally. The gastric axis is not used as a measure of liver size in the VD view. Rather, the position of the pyloric part of the stomach is an alternate landmark. With liver enlarge- ment, the pylorus is displaced caudally and medially in the VD view. In the lateral view, liver enlargement causes dorsal and caudal displacement of the pylorus. inexperienced interpreters. However, basic principles of radiographic opacity dictate this cannot be true or there would be border effacement of the liver margin and loss of serosal margin detail (see Figure 7-5). While fat enhances visualization of the periphery of abdominal organs, the opacity of the interior of abdominal organs relates to their constituency. Most abdominal organs are of soft tissue opacity, but the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract commonly contains material that is either more radiopaque than soft tissue, such as bone fragments, or less radiopaque than soft tissue, such as gas. LIVER The liver is located in the cranial aspect of the abdominal cavity, between the diaphragm and stomach. Most of the visible liver mass is to the right of midline (Figure 7-7). The liver should normally be of homogeneous soft tissue opacity. There is individual variation in the size of the normal liver in the dog and the cat, making the distinction between a mildly enlarged or mildly small liver from a normal liver highly subjective and relatively inaccurate. The position of the stomach is one parameter that is com- monly used as an indicator of liver size. It is generally accepted that if the liver is normal, a line connecting the gastric fundus with the gastric pylorus in a lateral radio- graph, termed the gastric axis, will range between being perpendicular to the spine or angled caudally such that it is parallel with the intercostal spaces (see Figure 7-7, A1). If the gastric axis extends outside of this range, crani- ally or caudally, then the possibility that the liver is decreased or increased in size, respectively, should be considered. It is important to note that the accepted Figure 7-6. Sagittal computed tomography (CT) image of a feline abdomen, acquired approximately 2.3 cm to the right of the midsagittal plane.

Extension of the liver beyond the costal arch cannot be taken as indisputable evidence of liver enlarge- ment. LI, Liver; SP, spleen. A SP LI A1 B 248 Atlas of Normal Radiographic Anatomy and Anatomic Variants in the Dog and Cat SPLEEN The spleen, a lymphatic organ, is located in the left hemi- abdomen. The spleen should be of homogeneous soft tissue opacity. The proximal aspect of the spleen, com- monly referred to as the head of the spleen, is located in close approximation to the gastric fundus. It is held loosely in this position by the gastrosplenic ligament and the short gastric arteries and veins that communicate with the splenic vessels.5 These short gastric arteries and veins can be less well-developed in the cat. 6 The distal extremity of the spleen, commonly called the tail of the spleen, is more mobile and variable in position than the proximal extremity. The size of a normal spleen is highly variable, espe- cially in the dog. In the dog, the spleen is usually of adequate size to be identified in both lateral and VD abdominal radiographs. In general, the spleen is smaller in the cat than in the dog. In the cat, a normal spleen usually can be identified in the VD but not the lateral radiograph. Occasionally, no portion of the normal feline The criteria for evaluating liver size in cats are the same as in dogs. However, it is important to recognize that the gastric pylorus in cats is normally located more medially than in dogs, residing nearly on the midline. Thus, a change in the position of the pylorus is rarely used to assess liver size in VD abdominal radiographs in cats (Figure 7-10). The gallbladder is situated between the quadrate lobe medially and the right medial lobe laterally, in the cranio- ventral aspect of the liver (Figure 7-11). In most patients, the normal gallbladder is not seen radiographically. Occasionally, especially in cats, a round opacity will be seen superimposed on the ventral aspect of the liver or extending slightly beyond the margin of the ventral aspect of the liver. This round opacity can be created by a normal, but modestly distended, gallbladder (Figure 7-12). This can be seen when there is no associated evidence of liver or gallbladder disease. However, visualization of this opacity may not always be normal and, if clinically indi- cated, the liver should be assessed using other methods, such as ultrasound examination. Figure 7-9. Lateral radiograph of a 9-year-old Rottweiler that ingested an excessive amount of dog food. The stomach is markedly distended with food. The liver extends beyond the costal arch in the cranioventral aspect of the abdomen, which likely is due to displacement caused by pressure from the enlarged stomach and not liver enlargement.

Ventrodorsal radiographs of a 12-year-old domestic cat without (A) and with (B) barium in the stomach, and of a 7-year-old Miniature Schnauzer with barium in the stomach (C). In the cat (A), note the midline location of the gastric pylorus (P). In A, the patient was slightly rotated when the radiograph was made, giving the pylorus a mildly exag- gerated midline position. The pylorus is easier to identify when there is barium in the stomach (B). The undulations in the pyloric antrum seen in A and B are due to normal peristalsis. In the dog (C), note the more rightward position of the gastric pylorus (P) versus the position in the cat. P C P A P B Figure 7-11. Dorsal plane CT image through the level of the gall- bladder in a cat. Note the right-sided location of the gallbladder (G) in the liver (Li). The hepatic vasculature is hyperattenuating as this patient received iodinated contrast medium prior to image acquisition. The overall attenuation of the liver is also increased due to the contrast medium in the sinusoids. There is no difference in the opacity of the gallbladder versus liver in radiographs. It is hypoattenuating to normal liver in CT images due to the inherent contrast resolution of CT compared to radiographs, and even more so in this patient due to the use of contrast medium. L, Left; R, right. LR G Li 250 Atlas of Normal Radiographic Anatomy and Anatomic Variants in the Dog and Cat spleen can be seen radiographically. If the spleen is seen in lateral and VD abdominal radiographs of a cat, the possibility of enlargement should be considered. As noted, the size of the normal spleen varies widely, according to its functional status and whether chemical restraint has been used for radiography. Determining the clinical significance of a spleen that appears radiographi- cally enlarged is not usually possible without other assessments, such as ultrasonography and/or cytologic sampling. When the spleen is visualized radiographically, it is important to realize that the entire spleen is not seen in any single radiographic view. When the x-ray beam is oriented along or parallel to (end-on projection) a length of the spleen, it typically has a triangular shape. If the body of the spleen is struck perpendicularly by the primary x-ray beam (side-on projection), there usually is insufficient absorption of the x-rays to see that portion of the spleen (Figure 7-13). The extent of the spleen that can be seen radiographically depends on the thickness of the spleen, its orientation to the primary x-ray beam, and the contrast resolution of the imaging system. In lateral abdominal radiographs of the dog, the distal extremity of the spleen is the portion seen most com- monly (Figure 7-14, A-B). In lateral recumbency, the distal extremity lying adjacent to the ventral abdominal Figure 7-12. Lateral radiograph of a 112-year-old Persian (A) and a 4-year-old domestic cat (B). In each radiograph, there is a round opacity extending beyond the ventral margin of the liver that is consistent with enlargement of the gallbladder (solid black arrows). This can be found without evidence of biliary disease and can be a normal variant in some subjects. BA Figure 7-13. Diagram of a spleen being struck by a primary x-ray beam oriented either side-on (perpendicular) or end-on (parallel). When the long axis of the spleen is struck side-on, there is inadequate absorption of x-rays for the spleen to be seen. When the long axis is struck end-on, the number of x-rays absorbed is increased, creating an opacity sufficient to be seen. What is seen radiographically when the spleen is struck end-on is only a fraction of the total spleen volume. X-ray beam: strikes spleen end-on, or parallel No discernible image of spleen Typical triangular appearance X-ray beam: strikes spleen side-on, or perpendicularly Chapter 7 n The Abdomen 251 A SP?

The distal extremity of the spleen has its typical triangular shape in the ventral aspect of the abdomen. The spleen is relatively large in this dog, likely due to the chemical restraint used to facilitate radiographic positioning. Conclusions regarding splenic disease cannot be made from a spleen with this appearance. As noted in the text, the triangular structure is only a fraction of the total splenic volume. In both the left and right lateral views, a portion of the spleen extending from the triangular region can be seen (solid white arrows in A1 and B1). Identifying this opacity as spleen is facilitated by it being contiguous with the familiar triangular splenic opacity; in isolation this opacity would likely not be diagnosed as spleen.

Occasionally, the portions of the spleen extending periph- erally from the distal extremity can also be seen (see Figure 7-14, A1 and B1, white arrows). With a moderately sized normal spleen, the proximal portion might be oriented in a way that creates an ill- defined mass effect in lateral radiographs in the region between the gastric fundus and the kidneys, without being visualized as a distinct triangular structure (see Figure 7-14, A1 and B1). Other imaging modalities would be needed to interpret this finding correctly, because a mass effect in this area in lateral radiographs could rep- resent an abnormal mass. In VD abdominal radiographs of the dog, it is the proximal extremity of the spleen that typically is seen (Figure 7-15). Again, this is due to the portion of the proximal extremity lying adjacent to the left abdominal wall being oriented end-on to the primary x-ray beam. Chapter 7 n The Abdomen 253 Figure 7-15.

The triangle lateral and caudal to the gastric fundus in (A) is the typical appearance of the proximal extremity of the spleen as seen in ventrodorsal views. In this dog, portions of the spleen extending from the region struck end-on by the primary x-ray beam can be seen (solid white arrows in A1, dotted lines in A2). These peripheral regions of the spleen cannot be seen in every dog. Their identification as spleen is facilitated by the fact that they are contiguous with the familiar triangular splenic opacity.

Occasionally, in cats with abundant abdominal fat, the proximal extremity of the spleen can be seen in lateral radiographs just caudal to the stomach (Figure 7-18). This appearance can be confused with an adrenal mass. If there is any question of the identity of a radiographic opacity caudal to the stomach in the cat, more specific imaging modalities of the region should be used. The great mobility of the spleen results in it having a different appearance in left versus right lateral radio- graphs of the abdomen, and, although the exact changes in splenic position that occur as a function of recumbency have not been completely characterized, the distal extrem- ity seems to be more conspicuous in right lateral radio- graphs (Figure 7-19). The effect of spleen conspicuity as a function of recumbency is most likely due to compres- sion of the dependent portion of the abdomen leading to a change in the location of the spleen. An accessory spleen, also called a splenunculus, is a focus of ectopic splenic tissue supplied by the splenic Similar to lateral views, portions of the spleen extending peripherally from the proximal extremity can sometimes be seen in VD radiographs (see Figure 7-15). In the dog, due to its mobility, the distal extremity of the spleen can be located in the cranioventral aspect of the abdomen and can create an oblong opacity that is often misdiagnosed as an enlarged liver lobe (Figure 7-16). The key to correctly distinguishing between spleen and liver in this circumstance relates to the location of the cranial aspect of the opacity in question. If the opacity is the distal extremity of the spleen, its cranial margin will not extend cranial to the gastric pylorus, and there will be a plane of fat opacity between it and the liver (see Figure 7-16), except in emaciated subjects. If the suspi- cious opacity is an enlarged liver lobe, the opacity can be traced cranial to the gastric pylorus, and there will not be a plane of fat opacity between it and the liver. As noted previously, the distal extremity of the feline spleen is rarely seen in lateral radiographs. Most com- monly, the normal feline spleen is seen in the VD view, lateral to the gastric fundus, with no aspect of the spleen Figure 7-16. Lateral radiograph of a 2-year-old Belgian Sheepdog (A) and corresponding labeled radiograph (A1). In A, there is an oval opacity in the cranioventral aspect of the abdomen representing the distal extremity of the spleen. Facts supporting this opacity being spleen and not liver are (1) the cranial limit of this opacity does not extend cranial to the gastric pylorus, and (2) there is a fat plane between the liver and the oval opacity.

If there is adequate fat surrounding the pancreas in this area, it can be identified in VD abdominal radiographs as a fusiform opacity medial to the midportion of the spleen (Figure 7-22). KIDNEYS The kidneys are paired retroperitoneal organs with one surface in contact with either hypaxial muscles or retroperitoneal fat, depending on the body habitus. The other renal surface is covered by peritoneum.9,10 The parenchyma of the kidney should have uniform soft tissue opacity, except in some subjects, especially cats, the presence of fat in the renal hilus will cause a focal decreased opacity in this region (Figures 7-23 and 7-24). artery (Figure 7-20). 7 Splenunculi can be located within the pancreas, whereas they will not be visible radiograph- ically, but they can also be separate and isolated from the spleen, being either of congenital or traumatic origin secondary to autoimplantation.8 If of adequate size and surrounded by adequate fat, isolated splenunduli can appear radiographically as a small mass adjacent to the spleen. It is important to be aware of the possible exis- tence of accessory splenic tissue so as not to immediately misdiagnose small masses adjacent to the spleen as abnormal. Other imaging modalities will be needed to confirm that the abnormal mass is typical of ectopic splenic tissue. PANCREAS The normal pancreas is not visible radiographically in the dog.

In the dog, normal kidneys typically measure between 2.5 and 3.5 times the length of the second lumbar vertebra, 11 whereas, in the cat, normal kidneys typically measure between 2.4 to 3 times the length of the second lumbar vertebra.12 Some excep- tions to these ratios have been identified in cats. For example, older cats without signs of renal disease can have smaller kidneys, 1.9 to 2.6 times the length of L2, but it is not known whether subclinical renal disease was present. 13 Also, intact cats may have larger kidneys (2.1 to 3.2 times the length of L2) than neutered cats (1.9 to 2.6 times the length of L2). 14 It is important to note that these ratios are only guidelines because the overall Figure 7-25.

The right kidney is never seen in its entirety; this is normal because the cranial pole is embedded in the renal fossa of the caudate lobe of the liver, and thus the kidney border is effaced in this region. In the right lateral view (B, B1), the amorphous opacity between the right kidney, gastric fundus, and gastric pylorus (asterisk in B1) is most likely due to the proximal extremity of the spleen. GF, Gastric fundus; GP, gastric pylorus; SP, spleen. number of subjects is small, and the normal status may not have been rigorously documented. Renal function must not be inferred based on the radiographic assess- ment of renal size. The left kidney is positioned slightly more caudal than the right kidney; this difference is more consistent in the dog. In the cat, the kidneys often lie at nearly the same craniocaudal level (see Figures 7-24 and 7-25). In the dog, the cranial pole of the right kidney is embedded in the renal fossa of the caudate lobe of the liver; thus either part of or the entire right kidney may not be visible radio- graphically (Figures 7-26 and 7-27).

Because the left kidney is relatively mobile, it is expected that the relative position of the kidneys will change in left versus right lateral abdominal radiographs. This is especially true in cats in which retroperitoneal fat has displaced the kidneys ventrally from the hypaxial muscles (Figure 7-30). The rationale behind discussing this concept is not to define a set pattern of kidney overlap in left versus right recumbency but rather to illustrate that the relative position of the kidneys can be quite different between left and right lateral views. the right side of the liver, the right kidney may become displaced caudally. In that instance, the cranial pole still cannot be seen as its border remains embedded in the caudate lobe fossa. When the right kidney is situated more caudally than normal as a result of a variant in anatomy rather than hepatomegaly, the cranial pole should be clearly seen, assuming there is adequate retro- peritoneal fat, because the kidney is no longer embedded in the caudate lobe of the liver (Figure 7-28). The left kidney is loosely attached and may be posi- tioned farther ventral in the abdomen than anticipated; this is typically more pronounced in cats than in dogs8 (Figure 7-29, B), but a ventrally located left kidney can also be seen in dogs (see Figure 7-27, B). Figure 7-28. Dorsal plane CT image of a dog where the right kidney is more caudally posi- tioned than normal. The cranial pole is not embedded in the renal fossa of the caudate lobe and is instead surrounded by fat, as is the left kidney. Both kidneys should be completely visualized in radiographs of this dog due to the fact that both are completely surrounded by fat. L, Left; S, spleen. L S Figure 7-29.

In A1, B1, and C1, the left kidney is outlined by a dashed line, and the visible portions of the right kidney are outlined by a solid line. In lateral abdominal radiographs of this cat, the left kidney is more caudal than the right (see Figures 7-20 and 7-21, where the kidneys are nearly superimposed in lateral radiographs). Despite abundant peritoneal fat and relatively little fecal material in the colon, the entire right kidney is difficult to identify. A larger amount of fecal material than present here reduces visualization of the kidneys in the ventrodorsal view even further. AC, Ascending colon; TC, transverse colon.

In the dog, note the greater overlap of the caudal pole of the right kidney and the cranial pole of the left kidney in the right lateral view.

A B C D Left Right RightLeft Chapter 7 n The Abdomen 265 URETERS Normal ureters are not visible radiographically. The deep circumflex iliac arteries and veins are branches of the abdominal aorta and caudal vena cava, respectively, which extend laterally from the aorta (Figure 7-31). If surrounded by adequate fat, these vessels create focal retroperitoneal opacities in lateral radiographs that may be misinterpreted as ureteral calculi (Figure 7-32). URINARY BLADDER The urinary bladder is positioned at the caudal aspect of the abdominal cavity and normally should be of homogeneous soft tissue opacity. Occasionally, gas will be present in a normal urinary bladder following cathe- terization or cystocentesis (Figure 7-33). Some urinary calculi are referred to as being radiolucent. However, the term radiolucent is relative, and, with reference to urinary calculi, the term radiolucent is used to describe calculi that Figure 7-31.

The deep circumflex iliac arteries and veins (solid white arrows) are branches of the abdominal aorta and caudal vena cava, respectively. B C A Figure 7-32. Lateral radiograph of a 4-year-old Welsh Corgi. The focal opacities in the caudal aspect of the retroperitoneal space (solid black arrow) are due to end-on projection of the deep circumflex iliac arteries and veins. These opacities should not be misinterpreted as ureteral calculi. Visualization of these vessels in lateral radiographs is more common in patients with abundant retroperitoneal fat. L7, Seventh lumbar vertebral body. L7 266 Atlas of Normal Radiographic Anatomy and Anatomic Variants in the Dog and Cat The size of the urinary bladder varies considerably, depending on the volume of urine it contains. House- broken animals can have a very large urinary bladder simply due to lack of urination (Figure 7-35). In cats, a distended urinary bladder becomes cranially displaced in the abdominal cavity, and, because of the large amount of abdominal fat commonly present, the urethra can usually be seen as a tubular structure extending caudally from the urinary bladder (see Figure 7-29, B). It should not be inferred that every distended urinary bladder is due to normal urine retention. Pathologic causes of are not visible in survey radiographs. This does not mean that the calculi are really radiolucent; it means they have the same radiographic opacity as soft tissue or urine. Thus, calculi thought of as being radiolucent will never appear as the air bubbles illustrated in Figure 7-33 because they are of soft tissue opacity and silhouette with sur- rounding urine. Indwelling urinary catheters can also create opacities in the urinary bladder, assuming they are not of soft tissue opacity. In general, urinary catheters are more opaque than soft tissue (Figure 7-34). Figure 7-33. A, Lateral radiograph of an 8-year-old domestic cat. The large oval radiolucency in the center of the urinary bladder is an air bubble introduced following voiding hydro- pulsion. B, Lateral radiograph of a 4-year-old domestic cat. There are multiple small focal radiolucencies in the center of the urinary bladder that represent small air bubbles introduced during cystocentesis. The streaky appearance in B is an artifact due to ultrasound gel contamination of the hair. A B Figure 7-34. A, Lateral radiograph of a 16-year-old domestic cat.

B, Lateral radiograph of a 4-year-old domestic cat. The linear opacity extending into the urinary bladder is typical for the appearance of a stiff plastic catheter. Multiple small air bubbles are also present in the urinary bladder in B. B A Chapter 7 n The Abdomen 267 Figure 7-35. A, Lateral radiograph of a 7-year-old Rottweiler. B, Lateral radiograph of a 14-year-old domestic cat. These animals have urinary bladder distension related to lack of urination. The Rottweiler is receiving intravenous fluids; an intravenous catheter is visible in the caudal aspect of the image. In the cat (B), note the cranial position of the distended urinary bladder. Cranial positioning of the bladder is a common finding in cats with urinary bladder distension. The urethra is the linear opacity extending caudally from the urinary bladder neck (solid black arrow). In B, the opacities superimposed on the dorsal aspect of the urinary bladder are the result of ultrasound gel staining the hair. A B urinary bladder distension should always be investigated if a grossly distended bladder is identified. PROSTATE GLAND A normal prostate gland is not visible radiographically in either the dog or cat; this is because of its small size and its position in the pelvic canal where it silhouettes with adjacent soft tissues. However, benign prostatic hypertro- phy is such a common development in middle-aged and old male dogs that many consider prostate gland enlarge- ment from that cause to be a normal variant. In benign prostatic hypertrophy, the prostate gland typically is mildly enlarged and is positioned just cranial to the ilio- pubic eminence of the pelvis. In this location, the pros- tate gland can usually be easily identified in a lateral radiograph. A triangle of fat is usually present between the caudoventral aspect of the urinary bladder, the cranio- ventral aspect of the prostate gland, and the subjacent portion of the abdominal wall. This triangle is a reliable 268 Atlas of Normal Radiographic Anatomy and Anatomic Variants in the Dog and Cat Figure 7-36. A, Lateral radiograph of an 8-year-old male Labrador Retriever. The prostate gland is enlarged and appears as a mass caudal to the bladder. The colon contains a large amount of fecal material. The triangle of fat between the cranioventral aspect of the prostate gland, the caudoventral aspect of the urinary bladder, and the ventral abdominal wall is very conspicuous. B, Same dog as in A with the triangle of fat indicated by arrows. C, Lateral radiograph of a 10-year-old neutered male Siberian Husky. The mildly enlarged prostate gland (black arrows) has more of a fusiform shape than in the dog illustrated in A and B. C A B radiographic sign of mild prostate gland enlargement, such as with benign prostatic hypertrophy (Figure 7-36). As for distension of the urinary bladder, it should not be inferred that every mildly enlarged prostate gland is due to benign prostatic hyperplasia. Pathologic causes of prostate gland enlargement should always be considered if the prostate gland is visible in survey abdominal radiographs. URETHRA The normal urethra is not visible radiographically in either the dog or the cat. If urethral calculi are suspected in a male dog, a lateral radiograph made with the pelvic limbs pulled cranially should be acquired. This allows for an unobstructed view of the entire urethra. In nor- mally positioned lateral abdominal radiographs, the pelvic limbs are usually superimposed on the urethra (Figure 7-37). When pulling the pelvic limbs cranially to assess the urethra in lateral radiographs, it is critical that the legs be pulled sufficiently forward so that no part of either pelvic limb remains superimposed on any portion of the urethra; otherwise, a superimposition artifact can lead to an incorrect assessment of a urethral calculus (Figure 7-38). Another normal variant that can be confused with a urethral calculus is an opacity created when the os penis has more than one ossification center. These small ossi- fication centers can be confused with a urethral calculus, an os penis fracture, or a foreign body (Figure 7-39). Chapter 7 n The Abdomen 269 Figure 7-37. Lateral radiograph (A) and corresponding illus- trated radiograph (B) of an 8-year-old Chow Chow suspected of having urinary calculi. The pelvic limbs have been pulled cranially to provide an unobstructed view of the urethra. The os penis is identified by the solid black arrow. The path of the normal urethra is shown by the dotted line in B. With this patient positioning, the dotted line represents the region that should be scrutinized carefully for radiopaque calculi. A B Figure 7-38. Lateral radiograph of the urethral region of a 10-year-old Standard Schnauzer made by pulling the pelvic limbs cranially, with the intent of achieving an unobstructed view of the urethral region to assess for urethral calculi. In this instance, the pelvic limbs were not pulled adequately cranially, and superimposition of one gastrocnemius fabella on the os penis creates an opacity (solid black arrow) that could be misin- terpreted as a urethral calculus. Figure 7-39. The os penis in this 7-year-old Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier has developed from two centers of ossification, a large one making up the majority of the structure and a small one located cranially. The small cranial ossification center could be confused with a foreign body, a fracture, or a urethral calcu- lus, although this is an unusual location for a calculus. Sometimes, a small secondary center of ossification is located caudal to the main body of the bone, rather than cranially as illustrated here. In that instance, the appearance could be con- fused with a urethral calculus. 270 Atlas of Normal Radiographic Anatomy and Anatomic Variants in the Dog and Cat The os penis is very conspicuous in dogs, surrounding the penile urethra. Little mention is made of the presence of an os penis in a cat, but a small linear opacity is occa- sionally detected in the perineal area of male cats.15 In a survey of 100 cats, an opacity consistent with a feline os penis was found in 19/50 (38%) cats imaged with com- puted radiography, and 8/50 (16%) cats imaged with an analog technology.15 That the linear opacity was due to penile bone, however, was confirmed in only one cat. Subjectively, the reported incidence of a feline os penis seems much higher than typically observed clinically. Special attention has to be paid to the feline perineum for detection of an os penis as it is much less conspicuous than in dogs (Figure 7-40). A superimposition artifact, wet hair, opaque urine sediment or urethral mineraliza- tion could all be confused with a feline os penis. Therefore, careful evaluation of cats with a penile opacity is needed to distinguish between an os penis and these other conditions. Figure 7-40. Lateral radiograph of the perineal area in an 8-year-old neutered male Domestic Shorthair cat. There is a faint linear opacity in the penis that is consistent with an os penis. This appearance could also be due to superficial debris or wet hair, or opaque urine sediment. This opacity was not proven to be an os penis, but this cat was urinating normally. STOMACH The stomach lies just caudal to the liver. The fundus is to the left of midline in the dorsal aspect of the abdo- men; the pylorus is on the right in the ventral aspect of the abdomen; and the body spans the midline from left dorsal to right ventral, connecting the fundus and the pylorus. As noted earlier, the pylorus in the cat is located in a more midline position than in the dog (see Figure 7-10). The stomach commonly contains both fluid and gas, and there is also often heterogeneous material in the stomach from a recent meal. Differentiating ingesta from foreign material is often not possible radiographically. The relative position of gas versus fluid in the stomach depends on the position of the patient during radiogra- phy (Figure 7-41). The redistribution of gas and fluid as a function of left versus right, and dorsal versus ventral, recumbency has a profound effect on the radiographic appearance of the stomach. Chapter 7 n The Abdomen 271 Figure 7-41. Transverse CT image of the cranial aspect of the abdomen of a dog. The stomach is outlined by a dotted line. The image has been rotated to illustrate the relative posi- tion of the gastric fundus (FU) and gastric pylorus (PY) in dorsoventral (DV), ventrodorsal (VD), right lateral (RL), and left lateral (LL) radiographs. The lumen of the stomach has been shaded to illustrate the effect of gravity on redistribution of fluid (white) and gas (black) as a function of body position. This redistribution has a profound effect on the radiographic appearance of the stomach. The principle of this illustration is valid only if there is both gas and fluid in the stomach. The radiographic appearance of a stomach containing only gas or only fluid (or only ingesta) is less affected by body position. L, Liver; S, spleen. RL LL PY S L DV FU VD 272 Atlas of Normal Radiographic Anatomy and Anatomic Variants in the Dog and Cat Figure 7-42. Ventrodorsal abdominal radiographs of a 6-month-old Labrador Retriever (A), a 4-year-old Yorkshire Terrier (B), and a 4-year-old Greyhound. Gas is present in the pylorus and body of the stomach in each of these dogs. In A, the fundus (F) is clearly seen and appears as a round opacity, being filled with homogeneous fluid. In B, the fundus has less fluid than in A; the fluid in the fundus is silhouetting with the gastric wall and creating a false impression of gastric wall thickening (hollow black arrowhead). The thickness of the gastrointestinal wall cannot be accurately assessed radiographically in most patients due to luminal contents causing border effacement of the wall. In C, the material in the fundus is more heterogeneous and the serosal margin of the fundus is less clearly seen, creating more of a mass effect. Knowledge of the position of the fundus and that it usually contains fluid or food in the ventrodorsal view should reduce the possibility of interpreting the fundus as a soft tissue mass. In C, the curving line superimposed on the body of the stomach (hollow black arrowhead) is a margin of the diaphragm; this appearance is typical in ventrodorsal radiographs for a deep-chested dog such as this Greyhound. F C F B F A In VD abdominal radiographs, fluid gravitates to the fundus and gas will be present in the pylorus and pos- sibly the body, depending on the volume of gas (see Figures 7-41 and 7-42). The appearance of the fundus in a VD radiograph depends on the amount of adjacent fat to provide contrast and the character of the contents within the fundus (see Figure 7-42). Even though dorsoventral (DV) abdominal radio- graphs are rarely made, it is important to understand the distribution of gas versus fluid in that position (Figure 7-41). In DV radiographs, fluid will gravitate to the pylorus and gas will rise to the fundus. The appearance of the body will depend on the relative amount of gas versus fluid and the absolute volume of both. When the patient is in left recumbency, fluid gravi- tates to the fundus, and gas will collect in the pylorus (see Figures 7-41 and 7-43, A-B). For a clearly demar- cated gas collection to be seen in the pylorus, the stomach must contain both gas and fluid. If the stomach is empty, or contains mostly food, the pylorus appears small and/or heterogeneous, respectively (see Figure 7-43, C). When the patient is in right recumbency, fluid gravi- tates to the pylorus, and gas will collect in the fundus (see Figures 7-41 and 7-44, A-B). The fluid-filled pylorus can appear quite round and conspicuous; this appearance is commonly misinterpreted as either an abdominal mass or a gastric foreign body (see Figures 7-44, A, and 7-45).

In B, the fundus contains an oblong gas collection and likely some fluid, and there is heterogeneous material in the body. In C, a clearly demarcated gas collection is not present in the pylorus (P) because the stomach mostly contains ingesta and not a combination of fluid and gas.

In A, fluid has filled the pylorus (P), which appears as a distinct round opacity adjacent to the liver. In B, there is less fluid in the stomach, and the pylorus (P) contains gas, even in a right lateral view. In B, the pylorus is more dorsally positioned than expected, but there is no mass accounting for this; thus it is a normal variant. In C, there is mostly food in the stomach and little fluid or gas; thus the gastric lumen is heterogeneous in each lateral view, and the gravitational change in appearance is not seen in this patient. Note the gastric rugal folds in the fundus in A and in the body of the stomach in B. P A P B C Chapter 7 n The Abdomen 275 Figure 7-45. Right lateral radiographs of an 11-year-old Whippet (A), a 4-year-old Greyhound (B), and a 2-year-old Pug (C). In each of these patients, fluid fills the pylorus (solid black arrow), creating a soft tissue mass effect that could easily be confused with an abdominal mass or a gastric foreign body. Note the gas in the fundus in each of these images, as expected in right recumbency. Also note the gastric rugal folds in the body of the stomach in B.

Note the conspicuous rugal folds in the body of the stomach. BA For a clearly demarcated gas collection to be seen in the fundus and for fluid to gravitate to the pylorus in a right lateral radiograph, the stomach must contain both gas and fluid. If the stomach does not contain fluid and gas, a mass-like, fluid-filled pylorus will not be seen. The mucosal surface of the stomach is characterized by folds, termed rugal folds or rugae. In survey radiographs, rugal folds can be seen only in portions of the stomach that contain gas (see Figures 7-44, A-B; 7-45, B; and 7-46). In general, rugal folds are more conspicuous in the fundus and/or body of the stomach than in the pylorus. In the cat, rugal folds are also present in the gastric mucosa, but they are not seen as commonly as in dogs. One unique aspect of the feline stomach is the presence of submucosal fat. 16,17 This submucosal fat is present to some degree in all cats, but the amount is variable 1 (Figure 7-47). Occasionally, the submucosal fat is visible radio- graphically in VD radiographs. When the stomach is empty and the x-ray beam strikes a section of the fundus head-on, the fat creates striated radiolucent regions in the stomach wall (Figure 7-48). The size and contents of the normal stomach can vary considerably. Occasionally, the amount of distension is alarming, but recent diagnostic interventional proce- dures, such as endoscopy or ingestion of large amounts of food, should be considered when interpreting the sig- nificance of a grossly distended stomach (see Figures 7-9 and 7-49). With physiologic or iatrogenic gastric disten- sion, repeat radiographs every few hours should be char- acterized by notable change. Chapter 7 n The Abdomen 277 Figure 7-48. Ventrodorsal radiographs of two different cats. In each, there are striated radio- lucencies in the wall of the stomach due to submucosal fat. Note that the stomach is empty in each cat; this is a requirement for visualization of the submucosal fat because the stomach must be contracted. Figure 7-47.

Ventrodorsal radiograph of a 7-year-old Miniature Schnauzer following admin- istration of barium sulfate (A) and corresponding labeled radiograph (A1). Barium is present in the stomach, duodenum, and jejunum. In A1, the course of the duodenum is indicated by the dotted line. AD, Ascending duodenum; CDF, caudal duodenal flexure; DB, duodenal bulb; DD, descending duodenum; PY, pylorus. AD CDF DD DB PY A1A SMALL INTESTINE The position of the duodenum is relatively constant in the abdomen. The very initial part of the duodenum, the duodenal bulb, travels either cranially or laterally from the pylorus, depending on individual variation, before turning caudally as the descending duodenum. The descending duodenum courses caudally along the right lateral abdominal wall. Cranial to the pelvic inlet, the descending duodenum turns to the left as the caudal duodenal flexure. In the left abdomen, the duodenum then turns cranially and courses to the left of the root of the mesentery to the cranial aspect of the abdomen, where it joins the jejunum1 (Figure 7-50). The diameter of the normal duodenum may be slightly larger than that of the normal jejunum, but this is rarely recognized radiographically. The antimesenteric surface of the descending duo- denum is characterized by mucosal depressions, called pseudoulcers, lying over submucosal lymphoid collections. In some dogs, pseudoulcers are large enough to be seen in upper gastrointestinal studies or when the duodenum contains gas 1,18 (Figures 7-51 and 7-52). The jejunum continues from the duodenum and occupies the midportion of the abdomen as a mass of overlapping and folded tubular segments. The canine jejunum is rarely completely empty; typically it contains gas and fluid, but the range of normal bowel contents in the dog is wide (Figure 7-53). The finding of radiopaque material in the canine jejunum is not common but does occur in patients with dietary indiscretion or food engorgement, as well as with some radiopaque medica- tions (see Figure 7-53, D). Regardless of content, it is important to have an appre- ciation for the size of the normal jejunum. Various subjec- tive rules have been proposed for assessing the diameter of normal jejunal segments. 19 (See Textbook of Veterinary Diagnostic Radiology19 for these guidelines and the original 280 Atlas of Normal Radiographic Anatomy and Anatomic Variants in the Dog and Cat Figure 7-52. Barium upper GI study in a 6-year-old Pomeranian. The crater-like depression from the descending duodenum that is filled with barium (black arrow) is a pseudoulcer. The irregular, fimbriated appearance of the jejunum and duodenum is also a normal variant, commonly seen in barium upper GI studies. Figure 7-51. Left lateral (A) and ventrodorsal (B) radiographs of a 6-month-old Labrador Retriever. The duodenum contains gas, and outpouchings of the lumen can be seen in both views (hollow black arrowheads); these are due to pseudoulcers. BA Chapter 7 n The Abdomen 281 Figure 7-53.

B, A 3-year-old Boxer. The jejunum is mainly gas-filled, but none of the segments are abnormally dilated. C, A 4-year-old Miniature Schnauzer. The jejunal segments contain either gas or fluid. The large gas-filled viscus (V) just dorsal to the fecal-containing descending colon is the normal cecum. D, A 13-year-old Border Collie. Occasionally, jejunal segments contain heterogeneous material rather than fluid or gas (hollow black arrowheads). This can result from ingestion of nondigestible particulate matter or from failure of complete gastric digestion that might occur with food engorgement. Although this appearance can be normal, it can also signify disease and must be interpreted in concert with clinical signs and history. Repeat radiographs are often useful in such patients to assess the disposition of the jejunal contents. A B V C D 282 Atlas of Normal Radiographic Anatomy and Anatomic Variants in the Dog and Cat Figure 7-54. One method to quantify jejunal size is to express the diameter of the jejunal segment in question as a ratio to the height of the narrowest portion of the body of the fifth lumbar vertebra. This lateral radiograph is of a patient with jejunal gas and some modestly distended segments. One might be concerned whether the diameter is excessive. In this patient, the ratio of the jejunal diameter/vertebral height is 1.5/1 = 1.5. This is within normal limits according to published standards.18 As noted in the text, no numeric standard is a perfect discriminator between normal and abnormal. L6 1 cm 1.5 cm sources.) Most guidelines for assessing jejunal diameter are relative, comparing the size of the jejunum visually with some other structure. Based on one quantitative assessment, the diameter of a normal jejunal segment in the dog should not be larger than 1.6 times the height of the narrowest portion of the fifth lumbar vertebral body 18,20 (Figure 7-54). However, the value of making such mea- surements with regard to the diagnostic accuracy of sus- pected small intestinal obstruction has been questioned.21 Therefore, caution must be used when employing radio- graphic measurement or comparison techniques to deter- mine normal size, because none has a perfect predictive power for discriminating between normal and abnormal, and qualitative evaluation of jejunal diameter may be just as suitable. Also, jejunal size must be considered along with the clinical signs and history and radiographic fea- tures of bowel obstruction other than diameter. Similar to the dog, the normal jejunal contents in the cat vary. However, the amount of bowel gas seen in survey abdominal radiographs may be less than commonly seen in the dog.22,23 Although this may be true, the normal jejunum in the cat can contain gas and the presence of jejunal gas cannot be used alone as a criterion of abnor- mal (Figure 7-55). A feline jejunum devoid of gas may appear bunched or centralized in the midabdomen. Centralization of bowel in the midabdomen has been mentioned as a sign of a linear foreign body.24 How- ever, a normal empty bowel centralized in the midabdo- men (see Figure 7-55, A) should not be confused with pathologic centralization due to plication, which is usu- ally accompanied by other signs of a linear foreign body obstruction. The finding of radiopaque material in the feline jejunum is less common than in the dog, but inges- tion of litter, foreign material, and some medications could result in the normal jejunum containing foreign material. It is usually impossible to assess the thickness of the stomach or jejunal wall from survey radiographs, because intraluminal fluid silhouettes with the wall and creates a layer of homogeneous soft tissue opacity composed of the wall and adjacent fluid (Figure 7-56). The jejunum terminates at the ileum in the right midabdomen. The jejunum and ileum are radiographi- cally indistinguishable from each other. LARGE INTESTINE The ileum joins the ascending colon in the midaspect of the right hemiabdomen, where there is a distinct ileocolic sphincter. The dog has a distinct cecum, which is a blind- ended, coiled outpouching from the proximal part of the ascending colon. This configuration creates distinct ileo- colic and cecocolic sphincters in the dog. The canine cecum is often gas-filled and appears as a coiled and/or compartmentalized gas-containing structure in the right midabdomen, usually visible in lateral and VD views (see Figures 7-53, C, and 7-57). There may not be an appre- ciable difference between the appearance of the cecum in Chapter 7 n The Abdomen 283 Figure 7-55. A range of normal feline jejunal radiographic appearances. A, A 1-year-old domestic cat. The jejunum contains no gas; a lack of jejunal gas is much more commonly encountered in the cat than in the dog. As a result of being empty, the jejunum in this cat appears centralized in the midabdomen. Centralized bowel has been associated with a linear foreign body as might occur as the bowel creeps along a linear foreign object. However, with a linear foreign body there will be abnormal gas bubbles in the bowel and not just centraliza- tion. Care must be taken not to misdiagnose a linear foreign body simply because the empty bowel appears centralized. Fecal material is present in the ascending colon in this cat. B, An 8-year-old domestic cat. Much of the jejunum contains gas. This is less common than in the dog, but as long as the jejunal diameter is normal, the finding of jejunal gas in a cat is not significant. Fecal material and gas are present in the descending colon in this cat. C, A 6-year- old domestic cat. The jejunum contains both gas and fluid. Some gas-filled portions of the jejunum are hypersegmented (hollow black arrowhead). This hypersegmented appearance is due to peristalsis and has been termed the string-of-pearls appearance. This hypersegmentation is rarely seen in survey radiographs but is commonly seen in upper gastrointestinal examina- tions in cats, especially in radiographs made soon after contrast medium administration. This hypersegmented appearance should not be confused with the plication that occurs with linear foreign body. Hypersegmentation does not result in an alteration in the path of the bowel, whereas with plication, the bowel is often arranged in folds. In this cat, the stomach contains food, and fecal material is present in all portions of the colon. A B C 284 Atlas of Normal Radiographic Anatomy and Anatomic Variants in the Dog and Cat Figure 7-56. A, Radiograph of a 4-year-old Basset Hound. Some jejunal segments appear to have a thick wall (hollow black arrowheads). Wall thickness can rarely be judged accurately from survey radiographs, because fluid in the lumen silhouettes with the wall, creating a layer of uniform opacity. This principle is illustrated in the drawing in B. A segment of intestine that contains fluid and gas is shown in the left side of the drawing; the gas will rise to the nondependent portion of the lumen. The solid diverging black lines in the left side of the drawing represent the trajectory of the oncoming x-ray beam that strikes the outer mucosal surface and the inner margin of the gas-fluid interface. The dotted black line represents the trajectory of the primary x-ray beam that strikes the mucosal-fluid interface. The wall of the jejunum and the fluid in the lumen will have the same radiographic opacity and will appear as one structure in the subsequent radiograph. The resulting radiograph is illustrated in the right side of the drawing. The wall of the bowel appears falsely thick due to the identical radiographic opacity of the bowel wall and the intraluminal fluid, which leads to border effacement between the two structures; that is, they silhouette with each other.

In each radiograph, the cecum is gas-filled and can be seen in the mid-aspect of the right abdomen (hollow black arrowheads). Fecal material is present in the cecum in E.

Right lateral (A) and ventrodorsal (B) radiographs of a 4-year-old Shetland Sheepdog, and corresponding labeled radiographs (A1, B1). In A1, a question mark (?) indi- cates a segment of large bowel that cannot be definitively identified due to superimposition; this may be ascending or descending colon. In B1, the course of the colon is outlined with a solid black line. It is not possible to trace the colon completely in every normal dog; visual- ization is a function of colon diameter and contents. In A and B, the cecum cannot be dis- cerned; this is common. In A1, solid black arrows indicate a jejunal segment that contains heterogeneous material; finding heterogeneous material in the small bowel is not common (see the section on the small intestine). This occurrence makes small bowel difficult to dif- ferentiate from the colon in some patients. The demarcation of the cranial aspect of the pelvic canal has been designated in A1 with a solid black line. Caudal to this point, the large bowel is termed the rectum.

The feline cecum (white arrow) is a blind pouch that connects directly to the ascending colon. left versus right lateral radiographs. The canine cecum rarely contains fecal material, but this can sometimes be seen (see Figure 7-49, E). As in the dog, the ileum in the cat joins the ascending colon in the right midabdomen, where there is a distinct ileocolic sphincter (Figure 7-58). The cecum in the cat is not as developed as in the dog. In the cat, the cecum is a comma-shaped diverticulum from the ascending colon without a distinct cecocolic sphincter (Figure 7-58). Because there is no sphincter between the cecum and the ascending colon in the cat, the feline cecum can some- times be identified in survey abdominal radiographs as the most proximal aspect of the colon at the ileocolic junction (see Figure 7-65). In the dog, the colon begins at the ileocolic junction and courses cranially as the ascending colon. Just caudal to the pylorus, the colon turns to the left at the right colic flexure and then courses transversely across the abdomen, cranial to the root of the mesentery, as the transverse colon. Just medial to the spleen, the colon turns caudally at the left colic flexure and continues as the descending colon. The descending colon continues through the pelvic canal as the rectum (Figures 7-59 and 7-60). In general, the canine colon usually contains a combination Chapter 7 n The Abdomen 287 A PY TC DC R ?

Ventrodorsal radiograph of a 7-year-old American Staffordshire Terrier. The urinary bladder is distended, and the descending colon (solid black arrows) is located in the right side of the abdomen; normally, the descending colon is on the left. A right-sided location of the descending colon is a commonly encountered normal variant when the bladder is distended. The horizontal line (solid white arrowheads) is due to the edge of the positioning trough being in the primary x-ray beam. of gas and heterogeneously appearing fecal material (see Figure 7-59). Occasionally, the descending colon lies to the right of midline; this seems to be more commonly observed when the urinary bladder is distended. Unless an abnormal mass that is displacing the colon to the right can be identified, this is usually a normal variant (Figure 7-61). In the dog, the colon is rarely completely filled with feces, but this is possible and can be normal, depending on the diameter. There are no quantitative guidelines for the normal size range of the colon in the dog, but the qualitative range of acceptable colon diameter is quite large. Normally, one does not encounter a fluid-filled colon in the dog. The normal canine colon can also be primarily empty, containing only gas. In these instances, peristalsis of the wall might be present and appear as multifocal regions of circumferential narrowing; this is a normal appearance and is not necessarily evidence for spasticity (Figure 7-62). Occasionally, the normal colon in the dog is elongated such that folding occurs (Figures 7-63 and 7-64). This redundancy of the colon has no clinical significance but can complicate radiographic interpretation of the abdomen due to the increased volume of gas- and fecal- containing intestinal segments visible. The colon in the cat is essentially the same as in the dog (Figure 7-65), except the ascending colon may be proportionally shorter. However, it is not unusual to find an ascending colon in the cat that is as comparably long as in the dog. The other difference in the feline large bowel, as noted previously, is the less developed cecum and the lack of a distinct cecocolic valve. The colon in the cat often contains fecal material and is rarely completely empty. As in the dog, finding a fluid-filled colon in the cat is not normal. Chapter 7 n The Abdomen 289 BA Figure 7-62. Right lateral (A) and ventrodorsal (B) radiographs of a 2-year-old Airedale Terrier. The colon mainly contains gas. Numerous regions of concentric narrowing of the colon are present. These are due to peristaltic contractions; their presence cannot be taken as evidence of hyperperistalsis or spasticity. A nonob- structive radiopaque foreign body is present in the colon near the right colic flexure. Any nonobstructive, nondigestible foreign body ultimately reaches the colon. A B Figure 7-63. Right lateral (A) and ventrodorsal (B) radiographs of an 11-year-old Labrador Retriever. The colon is longer than typically encoun- tered; this is a normal variant. This redundant colon leads to folds in the transverse colon that are gas-filled in this patient. The normal cecum is visible in its expected location. 290 Atlas of Normal Radiographic Anatomy and Anatomic Variants in the Dog and Cat Figure 7-64. Ventrodorsal radiograph of a 2-year-old mixed breed dog. The redundancy of the descending colon has resulted in a sigmoid configuration of its distal aspect. Figure 7-65. Right lateral (A) and ventrodorsal (B) radiographs of a 1-year-old domestic cat, and corresponding labeled radiographs (A1, B1). The approximate position of the cecum has been outlined with a dotted black line in A1 and noted with solid black arrows in B1. This cat has a proportionally shorter ascending colon than in most dogs; this is a normal finding for cats. However, a proportionally shorter ascending colon is not always found in cats, and some cats have a longer ascending colon than shown here. In B1, the course of the colon is outlined with a dotted black line. It is not possible to trace the colon completely in every normal cat; visualization is a function of colon diameter and contents. The demarcation of the cranial aspect of the pelvic canal is designated in A1 with a solid black line. Caudal to this point, the large bowel is termed the rectum.

Lateral radiograph of the caudodorsal aspect of the abdomen of an overweight cat. The small nodular opacity dorsal to the descending colon is the colic lymph node. The normal colic lymph node can occasionally be seen in very obese cats. Figure 7-67. Lateral (A) and ventrodorsal (B) radiographs of an 8-year-old domestic cat. Each adrenal gland is mineralized (solid black arrows). The left adrenal gland is not as con- spicuous in the ventrodorsal view due to superimposition with the spine. A B MISCELLANEOUS The following structures, which are not mentioned else- where in the chapter, are usually not identifiable in radio- graphs of normal dogs: uterus, adrenal glands, mesenteric lymph nodes, and retroperitoneal lymph nodes. In obese cats, the colic lymph node can sometimes be visible as an oval opacity located dorsal to the descending colon (Figure 7-66). Also in cats, the adrenal glands will some- times be mineralized and can be seen cranial to the kidneys (Figure 7-67). Although mineralization of the adrenal glands is an abnormality and not a normal variant, it typically has no clinical significance. Many types of hemoclips applied during abdominal surgery are radiopaque and can be seen in subsequent radiographs. The most commonly encountered hemo- clips are those used for ovariohysterectomy (Figure 7-68). Less commonly, hemoclips that were inserted during orchiectomy can sometimes be identified (Figure 7-69). Other types of metallic surgical implants can also be seen (Figure 7-70, D). Chapter 7 n The Abdomen 293 Figure 7-68. Lateral (A) and ventrodorsal (B) radiographs of a 10-year-old mixed breed dog. There are hemoclips near the caudal pole of each kidney and near the pelvic inlet that were placed by a surgeon during an ovariohysterectomy. In B, the hemoclip near the pelvic inlet is superimposed on the spine (solid black arrow). BA Figure 7-69. Lateral (A) and ventrodorsal (B) radiographs of an 8-year-old Basset Hound. There are two closely approximated surgical hemoclips in the left and right inguinal region that were placed around the spermatic cords during an orchiectomy procedure. The transected spermatic cords retracted through the inguinal canal, pulling the hemoclips to the level of the superficial inguinal ring.

Residual ultrasound gel created amorphous opacities superimposed on the abdomen (solid black arrows). The ultrasound-gel artifact identified by the more cranially located arrow is superim- posed on the spleen and could be confused with a splenic lesion. B, Lateral radiograph of a 7-year-old Domestic Longhair cat. The streaks in the inguinal area are due to residual ultra- sound gel. C, Lateral radiograph of a 10-year-old Golden Retriever. Residual ultrasound gel creates streaky opacities superimposed on fat in the ventral aspect of the abdomen that could easily be confused with a lesion, such as peritoneal fluid or steatitis. D, Same patient as in C. There are multiple small steel sutures in the ventral aspect of the abdominal wall that were placed at the time of ovariohysterectomy. A B C D Chapter 7 n The Abdomen 295 Figure 7-71. Ventrodorsal radiograph of a cat with pronounced retroperitoneal fat. The fat provides contrast for the margin of the paraspinal muscles (solid black arrowheads). Patients having abdominal ultrasonographic examina- tions prior to abdominal radiography are likely to have streaky radiopaque artifacts in the image from incom- pletely removed ultrasound gel or from wet hair follow- ing gel removal. Most patterns due to superimposed wet hair artifact are readily recognizable, but, occasionally, superimposition of the wet hair on the abdomen creates an unusual opacity that can be confused with a lesion (see Figures 7-33, B; 7-35, B; and 7-70). In cats with moderate retroperitoneal fat, the hypaxial muscles become very conspicuous in VD radiographs due to the contrast provided by the fat (Figure 7-71). This opacity should not be confused with an abdominal mass. REFERENCES 1. Evans HE, de Lahunta A: The digestive apparatus and abdomen.
