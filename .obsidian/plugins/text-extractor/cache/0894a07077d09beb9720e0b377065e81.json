Rumen 2. Reticulum 3. Omasum • Glandular 4. Abomasum Adult cow Adult calf Reticulum • Lies largely on the left side • Is the most cranial compartment • Extends from the cardia to the most cranial part of the diaphragm • Ventrally extends across the midline to lie above the xiphoid • Oesophagus empties into both reticulum and rumen at the cardia Reticulum – features and functions • Sieve for coarse material • Coarse material ➔ rumen • Fine material ➔ omasum • Forceful contractions • Folds form honeycomb structures • Wide ruminoreticular orifice • Medial wall forms reticular groove Dyce et al 2002 reticulum (images courtesy of Noah’s Arkive, University of Georgia) Traumatic Reticuloperitonitis (Hardware Disease) Rumen • Fills left half of the abdominal cavity • Extends across the midline especially caudally and ventrally • Dorsal sac may be palpated via the rectum • Dorsal sac is in direct contact with the upper part of the left flank • Auscultation, • palpation • and access Rumen - external features • Dorsal curvature • Ventral curvature • Two surfaces • Parietal or left surface • Visceral or right surface • Many grooves - demarcate it into several sacs Rumen - sacs • Dorsal sac • Ventral sac • Caudodorsal blind sac • Caudoventral blind sac • Cranial sac • Insula ruminis • (not a proper sac) Rumen - grooves • Ruminoreticular groove • Right and left longitudinal grooves • Right and left accessory grooves • Right and left dorsal coronary grooves • Right and left ventral coronary grooves • Caudal groove • Cranial groove Rumen-pillars • Ruminoreticular fold • Right and left ruminal pillars • Right and left accessory pillars • Right and left dorsal coronary pillars • Right and left ventral coronary pillars • Caudal pillar • Cranial pillar Rumen - papillae • Mucosal projections covering the rumen surface • Vary in height according to age, location, diet • Long/numerous - ventral + dorsal caudal blind sacs • Fewer and less prominent in ventral sac • Shorter or absent on the roof of dorsal sac Rumen - wallRumen - functions • Contractions mix ingesta • Fermentation chamber • Absorption of volatile fatty acids, sodium, water, etc. • Papillae increase surface area, assist mixing and act as heating rods • Rumination • Eructation Rumen gas • Rumen gas cap normal • Left paralumbar fossa, last few ribs • Gas removed by eructation • Ruminal tympany • gaseous distension Omasum • Lies mainly on the right of the midline • Left side faces the rumen and reticulum • Right side faces the liver and body wall • Smallest compartment in sheep /goat Omasum - functions • Absorption of fatty acids, water • Transfer of ingesta to abomasum • Sieve Omasum - external features • Spherical to ellipsoidal shape • Has greater and lesser curvatures • Lower pole has an extensive attachment to the fundic region of the abomasum • Much of the right surface is covered by the lesser omentum Omasum - internal features • Two openings • Omasal groove • Omasal laminae • Many parallel folds of four different sizes • Arise from greater curvature and sides and project towards the lesser curvature • Papillae Abomasum • Glandular stomach • Elongated and lies on the abdominal floor • Proximal part lies between the ventral sac of the rumen and the reticulum • Caudal end flexed around the lower pole of the omasum Abomasum position varies with: • Age • Pregnancy • Fullness of different compartments • Intrinsic abomasal activity • Contractions of the rumen and reticulum • Prone to dorso-lateral displacement UTERUS Abomasum - external features • Larger cranial pole • Pear shaped sac = fundus and body • Connected by muscle bundles to reticulum, ruminal atrium and ventral sac of rumen • Narrower caudal pole • Forms the pyloric region • Passes transversely to the right • Terminates at the pylorus Abomasum - internal features • Two openings • Omaso-abomasal orifice • Pylorus • Spiral folds • Torus spiral folds omaso-abomasal opening torus pyloricus Abomasum - wall • Mucosa - rich in glands (fundic, pyloric) • Thick muscularis mucosa • Submucosa • Muscularis externa (smooth muscle): • thick inner circular layer • thinner outer longitudinal layer • Serosa Gastric groove Function: • Muscular folds roll into a tube when the young animal drinks milk • Serves as a conduit for conveying milk from the oesophagus to the abomasum • May be induced in the adult Gastric groove • Reticular groove • Cardia to reticulo-omasal orifice • Bounded by 2 prominent muscular folds • Omasal groove • Reticulo-omasal orifice to omaso-abomasal orifice • Abomasal groove • Area without gastric folds Compound stomach - blood supply • Branches of the Celiac artery • Veins drain into the Portal vein Nerve supply • Branches from the dorsal and ventral trunks of the vagus nerve D V Comparative anatomy: Small ruminant • Reticulum - relatively larger • Ventral sac of rumen - relatively larger • Caudoventral blind sac extends more caudally than the dorsal • Omasum is the smallest compartment • Abomasum is relatively larger Clinical case • High yeilding dairy cow • Second month of lactation • Decreased appetite, milk production • Gas-filled visceral organ up against left body wall, under ribs 10-13 • Hear ‘pinging’ under stethoscope Abomasal displacement A) Normal topography of left abdominal viscera, cow. B) Left displacement of abomasum. Adapted from DeLahunta and Habel, Applied Veterinary Anatomy, W. B. Saunders, 1986. Abomasal displacement • Abomasal motility  • Gas build up • Gas-distended abomasum displaces dorsally • Treatment: – rolling – surgical or percutaneous sutures Summary • 4 compartments of the compound stomach: • Non-glandular • Rumen • Reticulum • Omasum • Glandular • Abomasum","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
