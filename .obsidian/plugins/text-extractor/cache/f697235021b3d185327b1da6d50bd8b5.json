Aging: The process of estimating the age of a horse by examining the appearance and development of the teeth. Agistment - A landholder allows another person's horse to be kept, or agisted, on his or her property for a fee. Anthelmintics: Name given to the various deworming medications used to control equine internal parasites. Appaloosa: Breed of horse exhibiting one of a number of distinct coloration patterns of spots on the body. Arabian: Ancient and graceful breed of horse, originating in the deserts of the Middle East and having a strong influence on many other breeds, including the Thoroughbred. Ascarids: Equine internal parasite, also known as roundworms. Primarily affect horses less than two years of age. Ascarids have the potential to cause liver damage, which is repairable, and lung damage, which is permanent. – B – Barrel Racing: A timed event in Western Riding where horse and rider complete a cloverleaf pattern around three barrels.

Bit: Mouthpiece, of made of metal but may be made of rubber or other man-made material and held in place by the bridle, by which the rider conveys instructions to the horse. Blaze: Elongated white marking down the front of the horse's face. (Also called a stripe) Bloodstock: Thoroughbred horses bred for racing. Boarding Stable: Equestrian facility where horse owners may keep their horse for a monthly fee. See also Livery Stable. Bots: Equine parasites. The larvae of the botfly is referred to as a bot. The botfly as an adult insect does not actually bite or cause direct pain to the horse, but lays eggs on the outer body of the horse. The eggs are small, round, and yellow-orange in color, and are attached to the hairs of the horse's body by the adult botfly. They are easily identifiable on the legs of a dark-colored horse. The horse then licks or bites the spot where the eggs are and subsequently ingests them. The larvae are transported to the horse's mouth, where they remain for about four weeks before migrating to the digestive system. The larvae stay specifically in the stomach, where they attach to the gastric lining with hooks in their mouthparts. These larvae then stay in the stomach for approximately eight to ten months until maturity, and then pass in the horse’s faeces. Usually only cause disease if there is a heavy burden. Breaking, or Breaking-In: The early education of the young horse, where it is taught the skills it will need for its future life as a riding or driving horse. Breed: An equine group bred selectively for consistent characteristics over a long period of time. Brood Mare: A mare used for breeding purposes.

Dressage: Competitive sport which, by a series of set tests, seeks to judge the horse's natural movement and level of training against an ideal – E – Endotoxemia: The presence of endotoxins in the blood, which, if derived from gram- negative rod-shaped bacteria, can cause systemic illness. Some types of gram-negative bacteria are naturally in the gut flora and don’t cause any harm unless the horse is sick for some other reason and these bacteria begin to excessively proliferate and then breach the intestinal wall, thus entering the bloodstream. When these bacteria die, their cell walls rupture, releasing a toxin into the bloodstream, causing endotoxemia. Common causes include damage to the mucous barrier in the intestines, inflammation of the small intestine, acute metritis (severe inflammation of the uterus due to infection, usually from a retained placenta), infection of the umbilicus in foals. Entire: Uncastrated male horse. (Also called stallion). Eventing: Equestrian competition held over one or three days and including the disciplines of dressage, cross country and show jumping.

Hotblood: Term describing horses of Arabian or Thoroughbred blood. – I – – J – – K – – L – Laminae: The insensitive laminae and the sensitive laminae intermesh together to hold the hoof wall to the coffin bone. Laminitis: Condition, caused by systemic upset, in which the laminae inside the hoof become inflammed and painful to the horse. Severe conditions can lead to founder.

Meconium: Firm, dark brown or black faecal matter passed by the foal shortly after birth. Metabolic Syndrome (also called equine metabolic syndrome or EMS): EMS is caused when fat cells or adipose tissue produce high levels of adipokines, a protein hormone that leads to an increase in cortisol. As a result of the abnormal hormone production, a horse’s normal response to the hormone insulin is disrupted, resulting in high insulin and glucose blood concentrations. The horse cannot properly metabolize carbohydrates, including starches and sugars. This mechanism can trigger the onset of laminitis. Equine Metabolic Syndrome is usually first recognized when chronic recurrent laminitis is seen in fat horses that lack other laminitis triggers.

Cartilage in joints with OCD doesn’t form normally; this causes the cartilage and bone underneath it to become irregular which can cause the development of cartilage and bone flaps that can either remain partially attached to the bone or break off and float around in the joint. Offside: The right-hand side of the horse. – P – Pacer: A horse which moves its legs in lateral pairs, rather than the conventional diagonal pairs. Palomino: Coat color in which the body can be varying shades of gold, with a silver or white mane and tail. Pastern: The sloping bone in the lower leg which connect the hoof to the fetlock. Pedal bone: (also known as the coffin bone, PIII or the distal phalanx). The most distal bone of the horse. Percheron: Breed of draft horse, originally bred in the Normandy region of France, but popular throughout the world. Piebald: English term for body colour of white with black patches. Pinworms: live in the lumen of the intestine. Female pinworms crawl out of the horse's rectum, deposit eggs and a sticky substance on the perianal region of the horse, and crawl back into the rectum. Main symptom is itchiness of tail head and around anus, causing the horse to rub its bottom against fences etc Points: (i) External features of the horse making up its conformation. (ii) in relations to coat colour, the points are the lower legs, mane and tail. For example, bay with black points is a bay with black lower legs as well as the customary black mane and tail.

Studbook: A book kept by a breed society or registry in which the pedigrees of horses eligable for registration are recorded. Syndication: process of selling shares in a racehorse such that ownership of the horse is split between two or more part-owners. – T – Tapeworms: Internal equine parasites. Anoplocephala perfoliata is the most common in Australia. Commonly live in clusters in the ileo-caecal junction, where they anchor themselves to the bowel lining using 4 suckers and then absorb nutrients from the bowel. The attachment of the worms to this area of the bowel lining causes thickening, inflammation and ulceration of the intestinal wall.

Thoroughbred: Breed of horse, originating in England, used as a race horse and also to add refinement to other breeds of horse. Thumps: (Synchronous diaphragmatic flutter). A horse with thumps will typically present with muscle twitching in their flanks, which are caused by abnormal contractions of the diaphragm. Caused by the phrenic nerve becoming hypersensitive, which is most commonly from dehydration, and electrolyte and mineral disturbances. The main culprit is normally low calcium, but can also occur with low magnesium, potassium, chloride and sodium. – U – – V – – W – Warmblood: In general terms, a half-bred, or part-bred horse, the result of an Arabian or Thoroughbred cross with other breeds. Also one of a number of specific breeds of horse which were developed by crossing hotblood and coldblood horses to produce a more refined, but athletically strong and capable horse, such as the Swedish Warmblood, the Dutch Warmblood Weanling: a foal after it has been weaned (usually around 6 months) before it becomes a yearling – X – – Y – Yearling: A horse which has had its first birthday but not reached its second birthday i.e. in its second year of life – Z –","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
