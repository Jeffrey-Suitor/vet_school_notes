Do not jump ahead. • This file gives you detailed instructions for completing each activity. Ask your tutor if you have any questions. • For some activities, you will be asked to record your answers to the questions by typing them into this file. You should save this PDF file each time you complete one of these questions, to make sure that your work does not get lost. Guidelines for effective Group work Your group will work at its best when everyone feels comfortable and “safe” to contribute to discussion. Here are a few suggestions that might help promote a safe and effective group work environment: • Ensure that you all know one another’s names- and that you use them during your conversations. • Effective listening is a key to effective group work. Respectful listening enhances a positive group dynamic, and creates a space where it is safe for all to contribute. • Taking time to discuss is really important- discussing involves questioning and responding, reviewing and reflecting, sharing understanding. This is where deep learning occurs. It can often be greatly enhanced by visualisation- by sharing of ideas, summaries and processes on your white board and by collective rephrasing and reframing of ideas. • Sharing of tasks and responsibilities is also important in group work. Perhaps make a roster and each week have a different group member take responsibility for the keyboard, and for completing your interactive pdf. 3 instructions Enter each group member’s name, Iand email address below. After you have completed working through this document, save a copy and follow the instructions at the end of the document to share it with your group via the LMS or email. GROUP NUMBER Name Email Address 4 triGGer You are “on call” at Strontium Veterinary Clinic close to Geelong and receive a phone call at 4.00 in the morning. You struggle to wake up and answer it, but hear a trainer on the other end of the line telling you that they are responsible for a 3 year old, Thoroughbred colt. They have found the colt rolling and distressed in its box and are concerned it has “colic”. QUESTION 1 • List the key information about the colt below. Key information is all the information that may be relevant in assessing his current condition. • Identify the colt’s main problem and make a list of how it may be caused using a systematic approach. We will call each item on this list a hypothesis. For each hypothesis discuss how it may be causing the identified problem. • What further information, which might be obtained from questioning the trainer, will help you decide between your hypotheses? Discuss your reasoning behind each question. • Is this an emergency requiring you to get out of bed? What is the trainer doing out of bed at 4.00 am? 5 history You hurriedly get out of bed and drive down to the Training Centre, where the trainer greets you and takes you to the colt’s box. The trainer reports that the colt was last checked at 10pm and everything appeared normal. The colt was left with a net of hay overnight and both the net and hay were missing this morning. Just before they called you, they discovered the colt rolling repeatedly in its box, sweating profusely and kicking at its flanks. There was some manure on the ground. The colt is in training and was due to do some trackwork this morning. QUESTION 2 • Summarize the additional information obtained from the history. • Based upon this information refine your hypotheses – decide whether they are more likely, less likely or can be excluded. Provide an explanation for each change. Give a mechanism for any new hypothesis. • What further information that you can obtain from a physical examination may help you refine your hypotheses? 6 physical examination While you are taking the history from the trainer, you observe the colt. He is continuously restless, getting up and down and at times he rolls quite vigorously. He has bruising around his left eye as a result of this. You also notice that he is sweating profusely. You proceed to perform a physical examination with the findings summarized below. Parameter Findings Normal Body weight kg 531 Temperature °C 40.2 36.9-38.3 Pulse 94 28-40 Respiration 24 8-16 Mucous membrane colour Dark pink with a cyanotic tinge Pink Capillary refill time s 4 ‹2 Thoracic examination NAD NAD (no abnormalities detected) Abdominal auscultation Gut sounds absent all 4 quadrants Regular gut sounds including one ileocaecal valve sound every minute Rectal examination Distended fluid filled loops of small intestine palpable Passage of stomach tube 6 litres of fetid, brown fluid refluxed spontaneously QUESTION 3 • Are there any terms that you do not understand? List these and discuss their meaning • List the additional information obtained from examination of the colt. • How would you summarise your observations of his gastrointestinal tract function? • How would you summarise your observations of his cardiovascular function? • How are the observed changes in his cardiovascular function related to gastrointestinal function? 7 QUIZ 1 Click back to the LMS and attempt Quiz 1 before continuing. QUESTION 4 • Based upon the information obtained from the physical examination refine your hypotheses regarding the cause of the colt’s colic – decide whether each of the possible causes you identified previously is more likely, less likely or can be excluded. • Construct a simplified anatomical diagram of a horse on your whiteboard to illustrate the normal cycle of gastro-intestinal secretions and (re-)absorption in the horse. • Construct a flow diagram on your white board to indicate how disturbances in these mechanisms could lead to the presenting signs and the findings on physical examination. • List the most likely hypotheses (diagnoses) for the cause of the colt’s colic. What further tests could be performed to differentiate between these diagnoses? 8 referr al Your assessment of the colt at this stage is that he is critically ill. You have identified that there is complete cessation of gut motility leading to distension of the small intestine with fluid and accumulation of fluid in the stomach. As horses cannot vomit, the fluid in the stomach has caused distension and increased pressure. You explain to the trainer and owner that without regular removal of this fluid by nasogastric tube, there is a risk of rupture of the stomach with catastrophic consequences. You decide at this point that referral to Dr. Sally Church at the University Equine Centre would be the best option for further diagnostics and treatment. You ring Dr. Church and find out that the cost of medical treatment will be approximately $3,000 for the first 24hr and $500/day for every day the colt remains in hospital, which could be several weeks. If the horse needed to go to surgery, the total hospital bill will likely be $8,000 to $14,000. The colt is uninsured and a 50% deposit of the initial cost of assessment and treatment is required on admission to the Equine Centre. At this stage the colt has a guarded prognosis and probably has only a 75% chance of survival even with intensive treatment. QUESTION 5 • Give three reasons that you will tell the trainer and owner why referral is the best course of action in this case, i.e.. what can a clinic offer that you, as an ambulatory vet, cannot? • What would you do if the owner declined referral? • Assuming the owner followed your advice, what type of medication would you give to the colt prior to referral? 9 a floppy r abbit By seven am you are back home, to be greeted by your house mate Brianna, who works at nearby Sheeoaks Veterinary clinic. “I’m on after hours” she says “and a new client has just rung- her rabbit, Officer Flops won’t eat this morning and is just sitting hunched in the corner of the hutch making a strange grinding noise they haven’t heard before. He usually comes running for his morning treats but today he isn’t interested”. “I’ve no idea what I’m going to do” she says… “I know nothing about rabbits!!” “Well actually we do know some things about rabbits, you reply with a wry smile- “I guess we need to decide first if this is an emergency”. Should we go in and look at it now or can it wait for an appointment later this afternoon? As you decide whether this may be an emergency for Officer Flops, brainstorm with your group some key pieces of information about rabbit biology and specifically rabbit digestive system biology that may help you to determine your next steps, and record these in the box below. If the owner wanted to wait until tomorrow what would you recommend? Are there any further questions to ask the owner immediately? 10 Over a quick cup of coffee you reassure one another that rabbits are just small mammals! They are hindgut fermenters and should graze relatively continuously with a slightly diurnal pattern. You also remember that they have continuously growing teeth. Brianna also reminds you that they are prey species and hide illness. Importantly this means that rabbits are often very sick by the time their owner notices. On the basis of this shared knowledge, together you agree that this indeed may be an emergency for Officer Flops and Brianna rings the owner back and arranges to meet you both at the clinic in 30 minutes. QUESTION 6 • What further information would you ask over the phone that might help as you take a history and examine the rabbit? 11 history Owner Tasha brings Officer Flops straight to the clinic and you get some more history from her. She has owned Officer Flops for 6 months and he is fed a good grain mix, lettuce, bread and grass. She remarks that he doesn’t like carrots. He is not vaccinated and has never been to the vet before. He lives outside by himself. Tasha had cleaned out the cage yesterday morning but noticed there were hardly any faecal pellets in the cage today. You ask about the straw in the bottom of the carrier “does Officer Flops get hay as well as this straw?” She looks at you blankly and says, “isn’t this hay?” In his carrier you can see a sample of his rabbit mix uneaten (A) and there is some dry straw in the bottom of the carrier. (B) A B QUESTION 7 • What new information have you obtained from the history? What are your initial observations? • What is the difference between hay and straw? Does it matter? 12 QUESTION 8 • Below is a list of common herbivore feeds you can purchase in a bale. What are the different purposes and nutritional benefits of each? Feed Purpose / Nutritional Benefit Lucerne Grass Hay Oaten Hay Timothy Hay Straw Gut stasis is a catch all phrase which refers to a rabbit when their gut has stopped moving normally for any reason. The reasons for a rabbit can be as simple as a change in diet, a fright, losing a bonded companion, pain (caused by dental disease or trauma). But rabbits can stop eating for other reasons too. Some common acute presentations for rabbits which you need to rule out for Officer Flops include; • Calicivirus • Myxomatosis • Liver Lobe torsion • Small intestinal obstruction (bloat) Officer Flops’ diet is not good – is now the time for an explanation of a fibrevore’s diet or should we assess him immediately? You decide assessing Officer Flops immediately is a good idea. Look up any terms or diseases you are unsure about. What are some of your differential diagnoses and how are you going to rule them out? 13 physical examination A physical examination will help you rule in or out many of the differential diagnoses you may have come up with. A physical examination in a rabbit is very similar to a dog or a cat BUT there are some areas where you need to pay attention. This is a link to a really good video that rabbit veterinarian Dr Lizzie Selby has made on clinical examination in the rabbit. You may not have time to look at it now, but it’s well worth a look when you have a moment! https://vimeo.com/339445919/5978c9c2c1 Here are some notes about clinical examination in the rabbit: • Always perform an oral examination – this includes palpating the upper and lower jaw lines for asymmetry or swelling, looking for excess salivation and looking inside the mouth at both the incisors and molar teeth. • Question: What is the normal anatomy of a rabbit’s mouth? • Always palpate the ear bases and look inside the ear canals with an otoscope checking for discharge, swelling and pruritis. • Palpate the abdomen for masses, pain and to check the size of the stomach. • Check the sex (many sex changes are performed in the blink of an eye in the consulting room and there are many female rabbits called Peter) while checking the perineum for soiling. ** This is also a rule out for Myxomatosis – pathognomonic signs are perauricular, periocular AND perineal swelling. • Always get an accurate weight for dosing and monitoring purposes • Absolutely you can take a basic TPR you might just need to get good at counting fast!!! Officer Flops doesn’t move or struggle as you take him out and Tasha is surprised – “we usually can’t handle him at all”, she says. 14 Below are some images of Officer Flops, taken during his clinical examination. Body condition score? Face and mouth - external view Views of incisors 15 Parameter Findings Normal Demeanour Flat and lethargic Cardiovascular/Respiratory system HR 200bpm 180-300bpm depending on size of rabbit RR 80 breaths per minute 30-60 breaths per minute Lung sounds normal Mucous membrane colour Pale pink Check during oral exam with otoscope or conjunctival mucosa Digestive system Gut sounds Absent Faeces Absent Abdominal exam Soiling of perineum Moderately painful mid to caudal abdomen on palpation; palpable firm but small stomach A rabbit may have a mucky bottom if it is unable to groom Oral cavity Incisor malocclusion (see pictures) Molars normal (as far as can be seen) Body condition Condition score 1/5 Covered in yellow dried urine, and matted hair around back end Normal 3/5 (Urine staining is normal in an entire male rabbit) Temperature 36.2 0C (38.5-40)* * from BSAVA Manual of Rabbit Medicine 2014 Ed Meredith and Lord 16 QUESTION 9 • List the additional information that you have obtained from examination of Officer Flops. • How might his diet have affected the condition of his teeth? • Do you think that the quality of diet would affect a rabbit’s teeth more significantly than a horse’s teeth? • How might his diet have contributed to his presentation today? • What is the role of incisor teeth in the rabbit? • How might his teeth have contributed to his presentation today 17 Your physical examination has confirmed that Officer Flops is unwell and likely to be in gut stasis. You are on your way to ruling out some of the serious presentations we have mentioned. A blood test is the next step in ruling in or out the other common causes of an emergency presentation in a rabbit. Most clinics are able to quickly run a Packed Cell Volume (PCV), Total Protein (TP) and blood glucose in house. These only need a small amount of blood and are quick and inexpensive. Why is it important to look at a PCV and TP together? Blood glucose is particularly interesting and useful in rabbits. Hyperglycaemia in rabbits is commonly seen in acute abdominal pain which occurs primarily in a small intestinal obstruction and very early in a liver lobe torsion. Hypoglycaemia is relatively common during later stages of a liver lobe torsion and for rabbits with calicivirus but this can be more variable. Officer Flops PCV/TP is 45%/80g/l (normal 30-40%/ 45-71 g/l)* and his blood glucose is 13 mmol/l (normal 4.2-8.2 mmol/l). * BSAVA “Rabbit Medicine”. Ed Meredith and Lord What does this tell you about his hydration status? What does it suggest about his pain levels? You may wonder how else we can assess pain in a rabbit. In order to quantify pain in individual animals and to assess pain in an individual animal over time, veterinarians have standardised a Grimace Score in Rabbits: • https://nc3rs.org.uk/rabbit-grimace-scale Here are two videos of Officer Flops at different times during his hospitalisation. Can you assess his grimace scale from these videos? Pain in the Gut Grimace score Pain in the Gut Grimace score 18 In the box below summarise your findings on Officer Flops condition, following your clinical examination and further testing. Based upon the information obtained from the physical examination refine your hypotheses regarding the cause of Officer Flops’ present condition. This will involve deciding whether each of the possible causes you identified previously is more likely, less likely or can be excluded. Construct a simple flow diagram to describe the mechanism by which his diet, dental disease, pain, low body condition score, hypothermia and dehydration might have contributed to his presentation. 19 manaGement Officer Flops’ presentation of being “flat” and collapsed, as well as bradycardic (low heart rate) and mildly hypothermic indicates early that he needs aggressive therapy. You explain to Tasha that Officer Flops has gut stasis and is very unwell. A combination of his diet and dental disease is likely to have caused this and he will need some treatment for his dental disease. “The first thing we need to do is provide emergency care and treat the gut stasis” you explain, “then we can deal with his dental disease, but we will need to trim his overgrown incisors today”. You also explain that gut stasis is very serious and can rapidly cause death in rabbits. I can’t believe it”. Says Tasha. ‘He seemed quite normal yesterday’. Tasha agrees to admit him for further treatment. Drawing on the knowledge that Officer Flops has gut stasis and is in pain, your priorities for his immediate treatment are to relieve his gut stasis and his pain. Officer Flops is placed on intravenous fluid therapy (through a catheter placed in an ear vein) and a fentanyl Constant Rate Infusion (CRI). Fentanyl is an opioid analgesic (similar to morphine). After he has received a bolus of fluids he is carefully warmed. What might happen to a small hypovolaemic animal if warmed quickly? What would happen to their blood pressure? You also trim his incisors so he can eat more easily as he recovers. Pain in the Gut Conscious incisor trim Pain in the Gut Post incisor trim happiness (NOTE – we never use clippers to cut a rabbit’s incisors. This can cause longitudinal fractures and cracks which allow bacteria to get into the tooth pulp and cause infection.) 20 After a few hours his Grimace pain score has improved, and he takes a feed of Critical Care by syringe. Why did we wait until now to feed him? When Tasha calls 30 minutes before close, Officer Flops is “thumping” at everyone who approaches his cage, and producing a few odd shaped faecal pellets. What does this “thumping” behaviour suggest about Flops? Tasha agrees to come in and pick him up. QUESTION 10 • What important information do you need to give her about his ongoing diet? Tasha is delighted to see that he is so much better, and also that you have trimmed his incisors. “Now that you have trimmed his teeth he should be ok now, right? She asks. How would you respond? QUIZ 2 Click back to the LMS and attempt Quiz 2 before continuing. QUESTION 11 • What are the causes of incisor malocclusion in a rabbit? • What further work up would you recommend for Officer Flops? 21 university equine centre Meanwhile, the trainer and his colt are on their way to the University Referral Hospital. Before leaving him you had explained that the colt is critically ill and that without treatment he is unlikely to survive more than a day or two. You tell him that his presenting signs and the findings on clinical examination suggest that there is an obstruction in the gastrointestinal tract, so that the colt is accumulating fluid in the small intestine and stomach. You explain that there are several reasons why referral to the University Hospital is his best option. Firstly, he can receive intensive nursing, with regular nasogastric suction to remove gastric fluid and prevent stomach rupture, pain management and fluid and electrolyte replacement. Secondly, furthermore sophisticated diagnostic procedures can be conducted to establish the cause of the intestinal stasis, and thirdly, should surgery be required this can be provided. At the University Equine Centre, Dr. Sally Church re-examines the colt with similar findings tothose you obtained previously. She performs the following further tests: Baseline blood work Parameter Result Reference Range PCV l/l 0.58 0.32-0.50 Total Protein g/l 85 60-80 Lactate mmol/l 1.2 ‹2.5 Na mmol/l 137 133-147 K mmol/l 4.1 2.8-4.7 Cl mmol/l 101 97-110 Abdominal ultrasound 22 Play the videoclip linked below and observe moving ultrasound trace. (Note the lack of change in duodenal diameter on this trace). Pain in the Gut Ultrasound Ultrasound report: The stomach is distended back to the 15th intercostal space, and the duodenum is dilated and fails to contract. There are numerous fluid filled non motile loops of small intestine. No evidence of obstructive lesion identified on ultrasound. 23 Peritoneal fluid sample analysis Parameter Result Reference Range Nucleated cell count x 10ˆ9/l 6.8 ‹10 Protein g/l 47 ‹25 Lactate mmol/l 1.2 ‹2.5 Cytology: Red blood cells are present but there is no erythrophagocytosis, which suggests haemorrhage is recent, possibly acquired at the time of collection. Nucleated cells > 90% neutrophils and ‹10% macrophages. Good cell morphology (no toxic changes). No bacteria seen. Passage of stomach tube A stomach tube is passed again and a further 10l of fluid is syphoned out: QUIZ 3 Click back to the LMS and attempt Quiz 3 before continuing. 24 treatment Dr. Church explains to you that she has a reasonable idea of the diagnosis and decides to manage the colt medically, rather than surgically. Whilst the duodenum is dilated and not moving, and there are distended fluid filled intestinal loops, she is reassured that the abdominocentesis shows no evidence of stomach or intestinal ischaemia or rupture (nucleated cell numbers (WBC) and lactate concentration in the peritoneal fluid sample are within the normal range). The elevated protein levels in this sample do though suggest the presence of a gastro-intestinal inflammatory process. However, she will keep an open mind and monitor the colt’s progress and response to treatment closely. treatment Given She initiates the following treatment for the colt. • Intravenous fluids A 20l intravenous fluid bolus given initially, followed by ongoing IV fluids in order to maintain hydration. • Placement and repeated suctioning of a naso-gastric tube Regular gastric decompression carried out by indwelling stomach tube. It is important to remember that fluid in the stomach will not spontaneously come out the stomach tube until the stomach is under pressure and thus regularly starting a syphon through the tube is important. In addition, water and feed are initially withheld and ongoing assessment and monitoring was undertaken to determine whether surgery is required. In this particular case surgery was not performed. Nil by mouth - water and feed were initially withheld The colt receives ongoing assessment and monitoring for the potential need for surgery, but as his condition improves it becomes clear that surgery will not be not needed. 25 proGress Watch the video below then answer the following questions. Pain in the Gut Progress QUESTION 12 • What treatment modalities are evident in the video clip? • You were told that the colt was three years old. Which incisor teeth are permanent and which incisor teeth are deciduous. Does the state of eruption of the teeth correlate with the stated age of this colt? 26 outcome By 4pm the heart rate and other cardinal signs have returned to normal. Gastric reflux is continued for 24 hours and intravenous fluids are maintained for 48 hours. Water and feed is gradually re-introduced once the reflux had resolved. The presumptive diagnosis in this case was anterior enteritis (duodenitis-proximal jejunitis). The aetiology of the condition is poorly understood but is characterized by severe inflammation of the proximal small intestine. Toxins produced by the bacteria Clostridium difficile have been implicated in this condition, as well as other types of bacterial or mycotoxins, although an underlying cause is rarely identified. Ileus is a consistent clinical finding, and this results in gastric distension and sometimes rupture in terminal cases. The condition is often managed medically, although surgical procedures to decompress the distended small intestine have been described (see references below). Gastric reflux (and/or a distended stomach / duodenum seen with ultrasound) strongly indicates a high intestinal obstruction, either a physical blockage or a functional blockage (ileus) and it can be very difficult to distinguish between the two without surgery. A physical blockage is more common and requires surgery. A functional blockage (ileus), as we suspect in this case, can be managed with intensive medical support. However, it can be difficult to rule out the possibility of a physical blockage that will require surgery. It helps to think about whether or not the owner would consent to or be able to afford surgery should it become necessary. This horse had no guts sounds and no SI motility visible on ultrasound. Continued GI motility is not reliant on continued feed intake, but it is vital for the continued movement and recycling of all the GI secretions. For the average 500kg horse secretions total around 100L per day (equivalent to its entire ECF volume). The horse does not drink 100L per day, the fluid in gastric secretions cycles out of and back into the ECF. In the horse (hind gut fermenters) the fluid resorption is more distal than other species. If the GI secretions do not reach the large colon to get reabsorbed the ECF volume (including the circulation) collapses. This colt was discharged two days after admission. The total cost of treatment was about $4500. His return to the racetrack took place 2 months later. 27 a visit to the r abbit clinic You explain to Tasha that whilst Flops has made a good recovery and his incisors have been trimmed, they will of course continue to grow, and it is important to understand why Flops has had such serious issues with tooth growth and incisor malocclusion at a young age. You refer Officer Flops to Dr Lizzie Selby, a vet with rabbit knowledge. Under sedation, Lizzie performs radiographs and obtains a 3D view of his skull to assess his teeth. See radiographs below, and also picture of a normal rabbit skull. 3D VR representation of normal rabbit skull Officer Flops Officer Flops Radiographs Compare the alignment of the incisors of the normal rabbit head with Flops’ incisors. Can you make any assessment of his molars? The images reveal that Flops has a primary incisor malocclusion but that his molars look normal at this stage, with minimal changes evident at the moment. Dr Lizzie recommends that it would be advisable to have him neutered and remove his 6 incisors. In addition, she recommends changes to his diet, with at least 70% of his diet contributed by good quality hay. She also suggests that he should be vaccinated against Rabbit Calicivirus. Tasha asks Lizzie if rabbits get lonely living by themselves. Lizzie explains that as prey animals it can be particularly stressful for rabbits to live alone, and that finding him a compatible companion would be good for him. 28 Despite his brush with death, life is now definitely looking up for Officer Flops! In our wrap up session, we will consider the following questions regarding rabbit dentition and its function- before this you may like to review this video of Buggy, a rabbit with a primary incisor malocclusion. He has difficulty biting pieces off the stalks of celery and instead has to throw it around until a piece falls off. Pain in the Gut Buggy QUESTION 13 • What job do the incisors perform? • Will Officer Flops be able to eat hay without them? • What might he find difficult without incisors and what ongoing care will he need? 29 references Arroyo, L.G. et al (2006) Potential role of Clostridium difficile as a cause of duodenitis- proximal jejunitis in horses.
