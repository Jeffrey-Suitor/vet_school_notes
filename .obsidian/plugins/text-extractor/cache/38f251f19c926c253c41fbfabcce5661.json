Where our pets come from and why we keep them 2. Regulation of pets in the community 3. Pets who need new homes – managing health in animal shelters Happy, healthy cats 1. Common cat breeds and their characteristics 2. Welfare needs of kittens and cats 3. Health needs of kittens and cats 4. Reproduction and breeding management of cats Happy, healthy dogs 1. Common dog breeds and their characteristics 2. Welfare needs of puppies and dogs 3. Health needs of puppies and dogs 4. Reproduction and breeding management of dogs Intended learning outcomes – Regulation of pets in the community Describe the systems which produce pet dogs and cats and the role of vets and regulation in maximising the welfare of animals within those systems (Section 1 – Where our pets come from and why we keep them) Describe problems that can arise with dogs and cats in the community and management of those problems which maximise the health and welfare of both animals and humans (Section 2 - Regulation of pets in the community) Describe the management of pets who need rehoming and how animal health and welfare is managed in shelters (Section 3 - Pets who need new homes – managing animal health in shelters) Animal health in shelters Animals come from 3 sources: • Stray • Surrender • Rescue • Many have unknown or poor health care histories 103,000 animals were received by the RSPCA nationally in 2020-21 Animal health in shelters To enable disease transmission: 1. A source of infection sufficient to cause disease (pathogen) 2. A susceptible host 3. A mode of transmission of the infection to another host for disease to continue i. Direct transmission ii. Indirect transmission (also known as fomite transmission) Iii. Droplet transmission iv. Airborne transmission v. Vector transmission (e.g., mosquito or rodent) Animal health in shelters 3 main aims of infectious disease control programs 1. Minimize host susceptibility - nutrition, pain control, avoid overcrowding, limit stress 2. Optimize every animal’s ability to resist disease - vaccinate and worm every animal on entry 3. Decrease likelihood of exposure to problem pathogens - facility design, animal and staff flow through shelter, properly communicated protocols (e.g. for cleaning and work flow) http://info.greenwaydrvet.com.au/Vet Services/tabid/25033/Default.aspx http://www.petspantry.com.au/products/drontal- allwormer-large-dog-35kg-70-tab-bottle Animal health in shelters Facility design – animal flow Cats and dogs are kept separate whenever possible in all areas of the shelter. Each area should have its own equipment and food preparation area. • Initial assessment area • Quarantine – healthy animals admitted must be quarantined for 8 days • Isolation - animals showing clinical signs consistent with infectious disease • Separate housing area for animals cleared from quarantine i.e. those awaiting adoption • Adoption area Animal health in shelters Facility design – animal flow Animal health in shelters Human and work flow aspects • Separate entry for those arriving with animals entering the facility and those entering looking to adopt • Clear protocols for work flow and standards of work required e.g. description of how cleaning must be done. • PPE for those working with isolated animals • Carers always examine healthy animals before those in quarantine and isolation • Excellent staff training Animal health in shelters Problem diseases in small animal shelters (not a full list) • Cats – feline respiratory disease (‘cat flu’). In some cases will carry the virus for the rest of their lives • Dogs - parvo, canine (kennel) cough Less common - canine coronavirus, Giardia • Zoonoses: • Ringworm – a fungal infection • Giardia – GI parasitic disease • cat scratch disease – bacterial disease caused by Bartonella henselae • intestinal worms e.g. roundworm, hookworm, tapeworm • bacterial diseases e.g. salmonella, campylobacter • toxoplasmosis - a particular problem for pregnant women http://care4catsibiza.org/education/ understanding-cat-flu-full/","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
