S T A T I O N 1 - H O R S E Label this diagram as you proceed through your examination of the equine digestive tract. STOMACH Small (5-15 litres) relative to size of horse but relatively large in unweaned foal – why? Located on the left side of abdomen within the ribcage. The margo plicatus marks the boundary between the non-glandular (continuous with oesophageal mucosa) and glandular (gastric and pyloric) regions of the gastric mucosa. There is a well developed cardiac sphincter and the oesophagus enters the stomach obliquely – significance? Note: shape, greater and lesser omenta, greater and lesser curvatures, saccus caecus, fundus, body, pylorus (pyloric antrum, pyloric canal, pyloric sphincter), margo plicatus, rugae. Q. Can the stomach be assessed during a clinical examination? SMALL INTESTINE 25 meters in length and unremarkable in appearance. Duodenum and ileum short, the latter having a thicker wall and being firm consistency. Most of the small intestine is located in the left dorsal abdomen DUODENUM Note: shape, flexures, major and minor duodenal papillae (openings of bile and pancreatic ducts), hepatoduodenal ligament and contained structures, JEJUNUM AND ILEUM The ileum empties into the left ventral aspect of the base of the caecum at the ileal papilla – externally marked by the ileocaecal fold. The ileal papilla comprises smooth muscle and contains a venous plexus. Note: vessels and mesenteries and the ileocaecal fold. LARGE INTESTINE CAECUM The caecum is 1 meter in length, comma shaped with a capacity of 30 litres. The base is located in the right dorsal abdomen partly against the flank and partly under the ribs. The body runs ventrally then cranially along the abdominal wall. The apex is near the xiphoid cartridge. 4 taenia (with haustra between) run most of the length of the caecum. Note: Position in the body, shape, base, body, apex taenia, haustra, termination of ileum (ileocaecal orifice), origin of colon (caecocolic orifice), lymph nodes, greater curvature, lesser curvature. COLON Large colon = ascending + transverse. Small colon = descending. Ascending colon: 4 parallel limbs and 3 flexures RVC (running adjacent to caecum) (4 taeniae) ➔ sternal flexure LVC (begins with small diameter but enlarges and remains wide until pelvic flexure) (4 taeniae) ➔ pelvic flexure (small diameter) LDC (taeniae increase from 1 to 3 along it’s length_ ➔ diaphragmatic flexure RDC (shortest and widest) (3 taeniae) Transverse colon: short and runs from right to left in front of the root of the mesentery. Descending colon: Long and of many loops. Located in dorsal, caudal and left part of the abdomen. Has 2 taeniae. Rectum – part of descending colon located within the pelvis. Note: arrangement of the various regions of the colon - The different parts and flexures - Taeniae and haustra (numbers on each) - Mesentery and lymph nodes Q: Which parts of the equine digestive tract could be examined via rectal palpation?

How do the relative sizes of the different forestomachs differ from the cow? S T A T I O N 3 – P I G The pig is a monogastric omnivore. The porcine gastrointestinal tract is similar in shape and position to that of the dog except for the caecum and ascending colon. The porcine caecum is larger; the ascending colon longer and in the form of a cone comprising two spirals. Identify the following organs of the porcine gastrointestinal tract and label the diagram below: Stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, caecum, ascending colon and descending colon. Also identify the pancreas, the portal vein and the major abdominal arteries if possible. Visualise the organs as if they were in the live animal – elevating the tract by grasping the root of the mesentery and lifting it slightly off the table may assist in this –also refer to the models, diagrams and foetal specimens provided. Identify the following features of the porcine gastrointestinal organs: STOMACH Shape, greater and lesser curvatures, greater and lesser omenta, diverticulum ventriculi (a small pouch protruding caudoventral from the dorsal region of the fundus), body, fundus and pylorus (including the pyloric sphincter and torus pyloricus (a mound of smooth muscle and adipose tissue protruding into the pyloric lumen). Note on the internal surface the non-glandular oesophageal region around the opening of the oesophagus and the cardiac, fundic and pyloric gland regions. Can you distinguish these different regions in this specimen? SMALL INTESTINES DUODENUM Initially passes caudally to the right of the root of the mesentery, length = 60cm. Identify, on the mucosal surface, the major duodenal papilla a few cm distal to the pylorus. The minor duodenal papilla is located a further 9 or 10 cm on but is not always obvious being but a small slit-like opening on the mucosal surface. Its approximate position can be estimated by reference to the pancreatic duct as it leaves the extremity of the right lobe of the pancreas to enter the duodenal wall. Which ducts open at the respective papillae in the pig? PANCREAS Note the colour of this organ and identify the right and left lobes and body with the annulus pancreaticus. Which major abdominal blood vessel passes through this opening? JEJUNUM Similar to that of the dog. Length = 14 – 19 cm. Observe the position of the mesenteric lymph nodes. How do they compare with those of the dog and sheep? ILEUM Short terminal section of small intestine. Is the demarcation between jejunum and ileum macroscopically distinct? If not, can you identify the boundary between the jejunum and the ileum by other means? Observe from the mucosal side the entry of the ileum into the large intestine at the caecocolic junction. Note the ileal papilla with the ileal orifice, ileal sphincter and frenula either side of the papilla. LARGE INTESTINES CAECUM Note the unremarkable transition from caecum to colon at this site. Observe the taeniae (thin muscular bands running longitudinally in the wall) and the haustra (rows of sacculations) between them. How many of each is present in this organ? COLON The ascending colon is formed into a cone; the base is anchored dorsally to the roof of the abdomen while the apex points ventrally and is freely movable within the abdominal cavity. The initial portion of the ascending colon spirals inwards from the base of the cone in a clockwise direction, this part has 2 taeniae and haustra. The distal portion, which has no taeniae and haustra, spirals outwards from the apex in an anti-clockwise direction and back up to the right caudal region of the base of the cone. From here it passes cranially to the right of the root of the mesentery to enter the transverse colon followed by the descending colon. Can you distinguish the 2 portions of the ascending colon within the spiral? The descending colon is similar to that of the dog in appearance and position. S T A T I O N 4 – F O W L The following describes the digestive tract (distal to the oropharynx) of the chicken. Note that there is some variation in the anatomy of the digestive tract between avian species, chiefly as a result of adaptation to different diets. These variations are mainly of the form, size or development of the crop, stomach or caeca. OESOPHAGUS The oesophagus is divided from the oropharynx by a row of papillae caudal to the laryngeal mound. It initially lies dorsal to the trachea but then runs down the neck on the right side of it. Cranial to the sternum the oesophagus expands to form the crop. Q. What is the function of the crop? The oesophagus continues into the body cavity where it passes dorsal to the tracheal bifurcation and heart to enter the stomach dorsal to the liver. STOMACH The stomach has two parts: The spindle shaped proventriculus is the glandular stomach that secretes HCl, mucus and pepsinogen. It opens into the gizzard via a constriction called the isthmus. The gizzard (ventriculus) has a thick muscular wall with a thick lining of a protein-carbohydrate complex called koilin. Note the presence of grit within the lumen. Q. What is the function of the gizzard? Note the gall bladder lying on the right side dorsal to the liver – this structure is absent in some avian species. Note also the spleen cranial to the gizzard and to the right of the proventriculus. INTESTINES The duodenum arises from the right side of the gizzard just distal to the isthmus. It makes a long u-shaped loop caudally and follows the caudal curvature of the gizzard. The pancreas lies between its descending and ascending limbs. The cystic duct from the gall bladder, the hepatic duct from the liver and the pancreatic ducts empty into the distal end of the ascending duodenum. The coiled jejunum begins distal to the duct openings. The ileum is considered to begin opposite the apices of the caeca and is connected to both caeca along its length by the ileocaecal folds. The paired caeca arise at the ileocolic junction and run cranially, parallel to the ileum. Q. What is the function of the caeca? The large intestine/colon and rectum is relatively short and functions to reabsorb water and electrolytes. The cloaca is a chamber that has three divisions separated by annular folds: 1) the coprodeum, into which the rectum opens 2) the urodeum, into which the oviduct/s (most avians retain only the left ovary and oviduct) or deferent ducts, as well as the ureters, open, and 3) the proctodeum, which opens to the exterior at the vent. The bursa of Fabricius, an important lymphoid organ, is located in the dorsal wall of the proctodeum. This is large in young birds but small or absent in adults. THE FOWL OROPHARYNX The orophaynx is the cavity that extends from the beak to the oesophagus. The roof of the oropharynx is formed by the palate. This has a long median cleft (the choana) that connects the oropharynx to the nasal cavity. This closes during swallowing. A shorter more caudal slit in the palate (the infundibular cleft) is the common opening of the auditory tubes. There are numerous caudally directed papillae on the walls of the oropharynx, along the caudal border of the tongue and demarcating the entrance to the oesophagus. The tongue lies on the floor of the cavity and is supported by a hyoid apparatus. Several sets of salivary glands discharge saliva through numerous openings in the walls. The laryngeal mound caudal to the base of the tongue has a median slit, the glottis, that is the entrance to the larynx. The glottis also closes during swallowing.
