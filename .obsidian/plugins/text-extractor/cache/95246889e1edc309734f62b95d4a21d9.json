What is their clinical significance? • What is a congenital portosystemic shunt? In which species are such shunts commonly diagnosed? Where is the likely location for a congenital shunt in a cat or a small breed of dog? Where is the likely location in a large breed of dog and why? • What conditions predispose to diffuse hepatic atrophy? • What conditions predispose to atrophy of a portion of the liver? • What are causes of hydropic degeneration of hepatocytes? • What is meant by the term steroid hepatopathy? In which domestic animal species is steroid hepatopathy observed and in what circumstances? • Briefly explain the pathogenesis of hepatic lipidosis. • What gross features would make you suspect that moderate to severe lipidosis of the liver is present? • Provide some examples of conditions in domestic animals that are typically associated with hepatic lipidosis. • What is amyloid? In what circumstances does hepatic amyloidosis develop in domestic animals? What is the prognosis for animals with hepatic amyloidosis? • What are the various pigments that can grossly discolour the liver? In what circumstances do these pigments accumulate? • What might cause caudal displacement of the liver? • What is a common cause of cranial displacement of the liver? • What can happen to a twisted liver lobe or a herniated lobe that is strangled by the hernia ring? • What are possible causes of rupture of the liver? What can liver rupture lead to? VETERINARY BIOSCIENCE: METABOLISM JAC 3.8.23","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
