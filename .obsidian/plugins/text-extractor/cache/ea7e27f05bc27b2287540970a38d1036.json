Check Creatine Kinase (CK) • Muscle specific enzyme • Useful to differentiate the source of AST elevation 2. Check for haemolysis • Haemolytic anaemia • Invitro haemolysis Enzyme changes after transient insult Veterinary Clinical Pathology Secrets, Rick Cowell Glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH) • Mitochondrial enzyme – requires greater cell damage to escape into serum • Half life horses 12-24hrs, cattle 14hrs • GLDH is a major marker of acute hepatocellular injury in all species – useful in large animals, as more specific than AST – rarely used in cats and dogs (ALT considered superior) – GLDH useful in birds and reptiles Sorbitol dehydrogenase (SDH) • Cytoplasmic enzyme • SDH is a useful marker of hepatocellular damage in horses and ruminants – more commonly used in the USA – however enzyme stability is an issue - decreases rapidly in stored samples • Half life 12-24hrs in horses www.thespruce.com Enzyme changes after transient insult Horses and ruminants Veterinary Clinical Pathology Secrets, Rick Cowell Noah’s Arkive Dog - Hepatic trauma Cow – liver necrosis, Fascioloides Cat – hepatocellular carcinoma Diseases causing liver enzyme elevations Cholestasis • Reduced outflow of bile - impairment anywhere between hepatocytes and bile duct entry to duodenum • Functional: • Defective or downregulated bile acid transporters e.g. endotoxins (sepsis), excess free FA (fasting) • Structural (obstructive): • Hepatic - constriction of canaliculi e.g. lipidosis, steroid hepatopathy, neoplasia, fibrosis, bile sludging • Post-hepatic – bile duct blockage e.g. cholelithiasis, pancreatitis, neoplasia, mucocoeles, inflammation “bile plugs or bile casts” = tissue evidence of cholestasis (stoppage or suppression of bile flow) Cytology Histopathology Cholestasis Markers Membrane enzymes • ALP • Corticosteroid ALP in dogs • GGT Induced by cholestasis, drugs and hormones Markers of Cholestasis • Hyperbilirubinemia – Bilirubin (normally excreted in bile) may spill over into blood (and urine) with severe cholestasis (hepatic or post-hepatic) – Also occurs with haemolysis (RBC lysis) • Hypercholesterolemia – Due to decreased clearance – Non-specific (increases with endocrine disease, pancreatitis, post prandially) https://www.cliniciansbrief.com/article/top-5-indications-emergency-corticosteroid-therapy Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) • Membrane bound enzyme • Serum ALP represents total ALP activity, which includes three major isoforms: 1. L-ALP: liver (hepatocytes and biliary epithelium) 2. B-ALP: bone (osteoblasts) 3. C-ALP: corticosteroid (hepatocytes) dog specific • Additional ALP isoforms include: • intestinal, leukocyte, renal, mammary and placental • short half lives and do not typically increase serum ALP • may see mild ALP elevations with mammary tumours, and late pregnant queens Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) Increased serum ALP: Cholestasis • Bile acid accumulation induces L-ALP synthesis • Dogs: high sensitivity for detecting cholestasis • increased ALP often precedes hyperbilirubinaemia • lacks specificity due to C-ALP isoform • Cats: lower sensitivity but specific for cholestasis • produce less ALP and very short half life • so any increase is considered significant • Large animals: poor sensitivity, wide ref interval (GGT preferred) Increased serum ALP: Increased osteoblastic activity • Induce B-ALP synthesis • young rapidly growing animals • osteosarcoma • fracture repair • active bone resorption • hyperparathyroidism • hyperthyroidism (also L-ALP) • Generally only mild increases in serum ALP (< 4 fold) Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) Increased serum ALP: Other causes • Corticosteroids (dogs only) – induce C-ALP from hepatocytes – source: • exogenous (therapeutic) • endogenous (chronic stress or hyperadrenocorticism) • Anticonvulsants – increased L-ALP production in cats and dogs • phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone (not shown to increase C-ALP) Alkaline phosphatase (ALP)Gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) Membrane bound enzyme • main source of GGT is the liver • especially biliary epithelium but also hepatocytes • also in pancreas, kidney, intestine, epididymis (lost into lumens) • colostrum also contains high levels of GGT • dogs, cats, sheep, cattle (but NOT horses) • in neonates, decreased GGT may indicate failure of passive transfer • measurement of IgG is gold standard https://kannada.oneindia.com Gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) GGT is a sensitive indicator of cholestasis and/or biliary hyperplasia in all domestic species – GGT more sensitive than ALP in ruminants and horses e.g. pyrrolizidine alkaloid toxicity in cattle e.g. cholelithiasis, cholangiohepatitis in horses – GGT increases usually precede increases in ALP in cats exception = some cases of hepatic lipidosis (↑ ALP:GGT ratio is highly suggestive) – GGT tends to parallel ALP in dogs Hepatic lipidosis Secondary to prolonged anorexia in a cat.Assessing enzyme abnormalities 1. Identify predominant pathologic process – hepatocellular injury vs cholestasis • increased enzyme activities cannot identify specific aetiology • most diseases are a mix of both processes 2. Identify magnitude of increased activity – may relate to the severity of damage (especially with cytoplasmic enzymes) – does not differentiate between reversible or irreversible damage or local vs diffuse damage 3. Identify rate of change – monitor changes over time to assess if process is active Serum enzyme interpretation • Enzyme activities have reference intervals - but are usually described as “fold increases” to interpret their significance/magnitude – allows comparison of values between different analysers e.g. ALT = 500 U/L (10-50)  there is a ‘10 fold’ increase in ALT • Rule of thumb: 2-3 fold increase above RI = mildly elevated 4-5 fold increase above RI = moderately elevated 10 fold increase above RI = markedly elevated Bilirubin • Yellow pigment – derived largely from breakdown of haemoglobin by macrophages (spleen, liver, BM) • Normally constantly produced and rapidly removed from plasma by the liver • Elevated bilirubin is used as a marker of liver disease but can indicate haemolysis • Types of bilirubin • Unconjugated (Bu) • Conjugated (Bc) Total Bilirubin (TBIL) • Delta bilirubin RBC Hgb Macrophage Bu transported in blood with albumin Liver Protein Fe Haemosiderin Bilirubin (unconjugated) Bilirubin uptake by hepatocytes (conjugated with glucuronic acid) Biliary system Bc in bileIntestine stercobilin urobilinogen Normal bilirubin metabolism Kidney urobilin Bilirubinuria Normal bilirubin metabolism • Unconjugated bilirubin (Bu) = indirect Bb/. Produced from degradation of heme from old red blood cells = ‘indirect’ bilirubin • Bound to albumin in blood and transported to liver • Uptake by hepatocytes and conjugated to glucuronic acid • Conjugated bilirubin (Bc) = direct Bb. Is water soluble and is excreted as a component of bile, into the intestine • Converted by intestinal bacteria to urobilinogen  stercobilin in faeces (brown colour to faeces)  urobilin in kidneys (yellow colour to urine) • In healthy dogs, a small amount of conjugated bilirubin spills into urine – may see (1+) on urine dipstick Mechanisms of Icterus Bile Bilirubin conjugation Haemoglobin Bilirubin Icterus can be: • Pre-hepatic (haemolysis) • Hepatic • Post-hepatic (bile duct obstruction) Bilirubinuria Jaundice = Icterus Clinical presentation of hyperbilirubinaemia Dog with prehepatic icterus due to IMHA Hyperbilirubinaemia clinically evident as jaundice/icterus when > 35 - 50 µmol/L Prehepatic hyperbilirubinaemia • Increased erythrocyte breakdown • Rate of Bu production exceeds rate of uptake or excretion by hepatocytes, resulting in elevated TBIL • Usually due to severe rapid haemolysis e.g. immune mediated haemolytic anaemia (IMHA) healthy liver can handle substantial haemolysis without an increase in bilirubin • Typically Bu > Bc, with no increase in liver enzymes however, hypoxic injury to hepatocytes or concurrent liver disease may complicate the pattern Blood smear: IMHA Anaemic - decreased red cell density Spherocytes - support extravascular haemolysis Ghost cells - support intravascular haemolysis Ghost cells Spherocytes Hepatic hyperbilirubinaemia • Elevated TBIL caused by abnormal uptake, conjugation or excretion of bilirubin by hepatocytes: – Decreased functional hepatic mass – e.g. chronic hepatitis, diffuse necrosis or neoplasia, end-stage liver disease – Anorexia/fasting in horses (cattle, cats) – mobilisation of fatty acids interfere with Bu uptake – Sepsis – inflammatory cytokines interfere with transporters • Typically mild elevations in bilirubin • Bu may predominate – but dependent on process Post hepatic hyperbilirubinaemia • Increased TBIL caused by obstruction of bile flow • Intrahepatic = compression of bile canaliculi • Extrahepatic = compression/obstruction of bile ducts • Typically Bc > Bu (except horses) • hyperbilirubinaemia can be marked • expect increased ALP/GGT and bilirubinuria Cholelith in a lion Noah’s Archive Hepatic coccidiosis in a rabbit Noah’s archive Bile peritonitis Cytology of abdominal effusion, showing inflammatory cells and yellow pigment (bile) Hyperbilirubinaemia – species variation • Dogs: Elevations in ALP/GGT more sensitive than elevations in bilirubin. Also have low renal threshold for bilirubin, so bilirubinuria precedes hyperbilirubinaemia. • Cats: May see hyperbilirubinaemia before increase in ALP/GGT Bilirubinuria is always significant. Can see slight increase with anorexia • Horses: Have increased bilirubin in health compared to other species (readily become icteric, especially with anorexia). Unconjugated bilirubin dominates, even in cholestatic conditions. Note they often have yellow serum in health (carotene). • Cattle: Icterus commonly due to haemolysis. Rarely due to liver disease or cholestasis in this species. Thank you!","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
