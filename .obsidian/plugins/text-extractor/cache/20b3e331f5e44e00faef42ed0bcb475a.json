Hypoplasia of the ovaries is a feature of masculinisation in heifer calves that share the uterus with male calves during twin pregnancies (freemartinism). Congenital unilateral renal hypoplasia in a goat kid Congenital unilateral renal hypoplasia in a dog Congenital unilateral renal hypoplasia in a dog Unilateral testicular hypoplasia in a deer Calf with cerebellar hypoplasia (brain on the left) due to in utero bovine viral diarrhoea (BVD) virus infection Cerebellar hypoplasia in a calf Cerebellar hypoplasia in a piglet (right) Cerebellar hypoplasia in a kitten (right) due to in utero infection with feline panleukopenia virus Congenital microphthalmia (ocular hypoplasia) in a piglet due to vitamin A deficiency in utero Congenital brachyghanthia inferior and superior (short mandible and maxilla) in a calf Congenital unilateral renal dysplasia Congenital chrondrodysplasia in calves – the disproportionate dwarfism is a consequence of disorganised development of the growth cartilage of bones Congenital chrondrodysplasia in a new-born calfSegmental aplasia of the small or large intestine can also be referred to as intestinal atresia. Atresia ani (imperforate anus) in a piglet Atresia ani in a piglet Atresia ani and coccygeal hypoplasia in a calf – note the short tail stump (arrow) Massive distension of the distal rectum and mucosal erosion/ulceration in a piglet with congenital atresia ani Massive abdominal distension in a piglet with congenital atresia ani Massive abdominal distension in a piglet with congenital intestinal atresia (segmental aplasia)Massive abdominal distension in a piglet with congenital large intestinal atresia (segmental aplasia) Acquired Disorders of Tissue Mass and Differentiation Cells can survive in a hostile environment by undergoing an adaptational change (e.g. atrophy, hypertrophy, hyperplasia or metaplasia). Atrophy Denervation (neurogenic) atrophy of skeletal muscle fibres (H&E stain) Residual bodies containing lipofuscin in atrophied hepatocytes (transmission electron micrograph) Golden-brown lipofuscin granules in sarcoplasm of atrophied cardiac myofibres (H&E stain) Sharp lobe border and wrinkled capsule of a liver of a dog with acquired portosystemic shunting and hence hepatocellular atrophy (H&E stain) Narrow cords of atrophied hepatocytes in a dog with portosystemic shunting (H&E stain) Histological appearance of a normal pancreas with endocrine islets of Langerhans (arrows) scattered throughout the exocrine parenchyma (H&E stain) Normal exocrine pancreatic acinar cells are large with apical eosinophilic (orange-pink-staining) zymogen granules (H&E stain) Nutritional atrophy of exocrine pancreatic acinar cells in a starving horse islets of Langerhans Severe nutritional atrophy of exocrine pancreatic acinar cells in a malnourished pig Exocrine pancreatic atrophy in a dog – note the small lobules and increased prominence of ducts, blood vessels and connective tissues (H&E stain) Juvenile exocrine pancreatic atrophy in a dogTemporal muscle atrophy in a dog Severe temporal muscle atrophy in a dog with masticatory myositis Skeletal muscle atrophy in a starving goat Brown atrophy of the myocardium in a cow – the gross colour change is due to accumulation of lipofuscin pigment Notwithstanding the severity of atrophy of these exocrine pancreatic cells in a starving pig, the atrophy is reversible (although it will take some time for these cells to return to their normal size and functional state) (H&E stain). Thymic atrophy in a calf – the thymus (arrow) normally undergoes physiological atrophy around the time of puberty. Astronauts undergo atrophy of skeletal muscle fibres and of bone (osteoporosis) due to the low gravity environment of space. Loss of medullary trabecular bone in osteoporosis Skeletal muscle atrophy in a calf due to patellar luxation and disuse of the right hindlimb Femoral nerve paralysis in a calf with neurogenic atrophy of the hindlimb muscles Unilateral (left) denervation atrophy of extrinsic skeletal muscles of the larynx in a “roarer” horse with laryngeal hemiplegia due to injury to the left recurrent laryngeal nerve Paravertebral skeletal muscle atrophy in a cow due to reduced activity resulting from a chronic degenerative change involving the lumbar vertebrae (spondylosis) Denervation atrophy of hindlimb muscles (especially of the right hindlimb) in a horse with stringhalt, a degenerative condition of long motor nerves Traumatic radial nerve paralysis in a dog Chronic denervation atrophy of skeletal muscle due to radial nerve paralysis in a dog (H&E stain) Atrophy of hepatocytes due to diversion of portal venous blood flow and hence deprivation of nutrients from the small intestine and trophic factors such as insulin and glucagon from the endocrine pancreas (H&E stain) Brain atrophy in a cat due to compression by a meningioma (a benign tumour arising from the meninges) – pressure atrophy often involves compromised blood flow in or out of the compressed tissues meningioma Atrophy of renal parenchyma in a sheep with hydronephrosis due to a lower urinary tract obstruction Atrophy of adrenal cortices in a dog due to long term corticosteroid therapy and decreased endogenous ACTH secretion from the pituitary gland Atrophy of the left liver lobe in a sheep with chronic liver fluke infestation of the bile ducts and hence decreased bile outflow atrophic left lobe liver fluke in bile ducts Atrophy of the exocrine pancreas in a dog due to obstruction of the pancreatic duct (H&E stain) Atrophy of skeletal muscle and fat in a starving calf Emaciation due to poorly controlled diabetes mellitus and hence malassimilation of ingested nutrients Serous atrophy of epicardial fat in a cow – this is an indicator of rapid mobilisation of fat stores Serous atrophy of bone marrow fat – this is the last depot of body fat to be mobilised and hence is always an indicator of chronic starvation or cachexia Osteoporosis and serous atrophy of marrow fat in a chronically malnourished sheep Small intestinal villous atrophy in a pigletProgressive atrophic rhinitis in a pigProgressive atrophic rhinitis in pigs – atrophy of nasal turbinatesCerebellar abiotrophy in an alpaca Ageing is a form of physiological multi-system atrophy. Ageing involves atrophy of reproductive organs, skeletal muscles, fat stores, bones, lymphoid tissue and the central nervous system. Osteoporosis with loss of medullary trabecular and cortical bone is a feature of old age. Human brain with advanced senile atrophy of the cerebral cortex and yellow discolouration due to lipofuscin pigment accumulation In general, the smaller the animal, the higher the metabolic rate and the shorter the lifespan due to “wear and tear” on cells. Cellular ageing involves a combination of progressively diminishing replicative capacity and accumulated cellular and molecular damage.Dolly, the first cloned animal, was recognised to be prematurely aged because her cells demonstrated telomere shortening.
