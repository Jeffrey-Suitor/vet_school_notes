Pulmonary. Axillary and femoral arteries and their branches Usually within the parenchyma of organs etc. As for arterioles Tunica intima Lined by a single layer of non-fenestrated endothelial cells supported by sub- endothelial c.t. Fenestrated internal elastic membrane (inconspicuous because of similar elastic lamina in the t. media) Lined by a single layer of non-fenestrated endothelial cells backed by varying amounts of c.t. (depending on vessel size) Fenestrated internal elastic membrane - conspicuous, wavy refractile line Lined by a single layer of non-fenestrated endothelial cells, supported by a few connective tissue cells Has a thin fenestrated internal elastic membrane but the smallest arterioles lack elastic elements altogether Lined by a single layer of non- fenestrated endothelial cells, supported by a few collagen fibres but no internal elastic membrane is present Tunica media Series of concentric fenestrated elastic lamellae, scattered smc lie between the lamellae. External elastic membrane is indistinguishable. Layer upon layer of circular or spiral smc with a relatively weak external elastic lamina. Only 1-2 layers of circular or spiral smc Proximal end of the metarteriole - intermittent single layer of circular or spiral smc, but towards the distal end - no smc therefore no t. media Tunica adventitia Elastic fibres reinforced by collagen fibres mingle with surrounding c.t. Collagen and some elastic fibres blend with the surrounding c.t. Sympathetic vasomotor fibres in the adventitia innervate smc in the t. media Composed of loose c.t. carrying unmyelinated axons that innervate the smc's. Composed of varying amounts of loose c.t. that blends with the surrounding c.t. c.t. = connective tissue smc = smooth muscle cells CLASSIFICATION OF VENOUS VESSELS: Classification Muscular venules Small to Medium Veins Large Veins Function Capacitance vessels Capacitance vessels Capacitance vessels Calibre 50 - 1000 m Varying size: Small 0.2-1mm Medium 1-10mm Greater than 10mm Examples Usually within the parenchyma of organs etc. Cranial and caudal vena cava tunica intima Lined by a thick layer of non-fenestrated endothelial cells supported by a few scattered collagen and elastic fibres Lined by a thick layer of non-fenestrated endothelial cells supported by a thin layer of collagen fibrils and in the medium size veins a few scant elastic fibres Same as small - medium veins tunica media Weakly developed with 1-2 layers of innervated smc (compared to several in accompanying arteriole) Very thin layer with a limited number of smc layers Similar to small-medium but may have several layers of innervated circular smc with some collagen and elastic fibres t. adventitia Relatively thick layer of collagenous c.t. with sympathetic vasomotor axons Often the thickest layer-consisting of many collagen fibres and a few elastic fibres and some smc Thickest layer - contains abundant longitudinally oriented smc along with collagen and elastic fibrils c.t. = connective tissue smc = smooth muscle cells","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
