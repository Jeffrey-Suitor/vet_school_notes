The Right Kidney • Place the transducer against the last rib laterally • Direct the beam cranially and lateral • The kidney is often angled in a dorsal ventral plane Descending Duodenum and the Pancreas • Between the right kidney and the ventral body wall • Usually is very superficial • The initial landmark in the cat is the gall bladder • The pancreas is caudal to the gall bladder Scan Down the Mid Abdomen • Identify small intestine and look for lymph nodes • Evaluation of the mesentery Questions and Comments","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
