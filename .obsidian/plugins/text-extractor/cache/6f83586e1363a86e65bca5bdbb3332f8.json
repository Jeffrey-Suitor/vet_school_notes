Owning multiple animals of the same or different species is common and not all inter-animal relationships are happy. Unfriendly or aggressive first meetings between cats have been associated with continued fighting (Levine et al.2005. Intercat aggression in households following the introduction of a new cat. Applanim, 90: 325-336) https://cattybox.com/blogs/cat-tips-facts/i-got-a-new-kitten-and-my- cat-hates-me Cat-to-cat introductions What aspects of cat behaviour and husbandry covered previously can be applied to this situation? Note your thoughts in the learning activity below https://catingtonpost.com/how-to-properly-introduce-two-cats/ Cat-to-cat introductions Step 1: Place new cat in a prepared room for several days to a week Step 2: Scent swapping using a blanket or similar from each cat; visiting the other cat’s area Step 3: Visual contact through a physical barrier Step 4: Supervised contact https://catingtonpost.com/how-to-properly-introduce-two-cats/ Dog-to-dog introductions Step 1: Meet on neutral territory Step 2: Reward good behaviour when around the other dog Step 3: Introduce at home through a baby gate, removing items that might cause tension Step 4: Supervised interactions with separate resource areas until confident they are getting along https://www.humanesociety.org/resources/introducing-new-dogs Introducing a new dog to a resident cat Step 1: Preparation of core safe area for cat; install baby gate and Feliway diffuser (both optional); prepare an area for the dog Step 2: Animals take turns to have access to the house while the other is confined in its safe place over a few days Step 3: Introduce at home through a baby gate when the dog is calm, making sure the cat has easy access to escape routes Step 4: Supervised interactions with escape areas until for the cat until confident they are getting along https://www.thesprucepets.com/introducing-dogs-and-cats-1117460 Introducing a new cat to a resident dog Step 1: ?

Describe strategies for introducing new animals into a household applying principles of dog and cat behaviour and communication 2. Explain options for management of undesired behaviours in order to improve welfare outcomes for humans, cats and dogs • Normal behaviour (especially for young animals) but annoying e.g. dog does not sit, cat scratching furniture • Non-pathologic behaviours which are significantly impact the owners e.g. dog barking excessively at strangers passing, cat urinating outside the litter box • Fear/anxiety problems e.g. fear-based aggression. These are much more complex due to emotional (i.e. unconscious) response • Three major strategies for management: • Behavioural modification (conditioning) • Environmental modification • Pharmacological modification (medication) Range of undesirable behaviours • Operant conditioning is about associating a voluntary behaviour and a consequence • Classical conditioning involves associating an involuntary response and a stimulus • The type of problem influences the appropriate type of conditioning to use. Behavioural modification - two major types of learning (conditioning) https://psychologenie.com/difference-between-operant-classical-conditioning Behavioural modification - operant conditioning - obedience training Image: Dr Dennis Wormald • A conscious decision to act (cerebral cortex and hippocampus) • Reward will increase the frequency of a behaviour and punishment will decrease it • Involves the amygdala (primitive part of brain strongly involved in emotional responses) • Unconscious learning through pairing of stimuli • The conditioned stimulus elicits an emotional state e.g. anxiety, fear, sexual behaviours • Responses elicited are mostly autonomic (adrenaline, pupil size, heart rate, salivation) • Responses are fast and cannot be delayed • These responses cannot be rewarded or punished Behavioural modification - classical conditioning – managing emotional responses • Principles of classical conditioning can be used to modify behaviours using desensitisation and counter- conditioning Image: Dr Dennis Wormald Desensitisation - classical ‘unconditioning’ Image: Dr Dennis Wormald • Very gradual exposure to the scary thing, starting at a very low level and building up very slowly. At every step on the way, dog needs to be happy and comfortable. • Going too fast may frighten the dog, resulting in sensitisation instead of desensitisation Desensitisation - classical ‘unconditioning’ Dog-training-excellence.com Classical counter-conditioning • Used to change the pet’s emotional response, feelings or attitude toward a stimulus. It pairs the presence of the negative stimulus (the scary thing) with a favourite reward to change the animal’s emotional state. • Desensitisation and counter-conditioning are often used in combination. • The video below is an example of using counter-conditioning: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3_lbNnGr7o • Advantages: • Often relatively easy • Usually reversible • Easy to identify changes in behaviour after changing the environment • Disadvantage: • Doesn’t address the behaviour • Dog example: modifying territorial aggression through blocking visual access • Cat examples: Separation from stressors e.g. baby gate, Changing litter management e.g. cleaning litter trays/changing litter type Environmental modification • Can reduce fear and anxiety • Reduces arousal – high levels of arousal (readiness to act in a given situation) inhibits memory formation and interfere with desensitisation and counter- conditioning • Good welfare for animal and humans Pharmacological modification - medication https://www.1800petmeds.com/Fluoxetine-prod10489.html • Normal behaviour (especially for young animals) but annoying e.g. dog does not sit. Relatively easy to manage with basic training using operant conditioning i.e. teaching the dog a new way to respond to an instruction. • Non-pathologic behaviours which are significantly impact the owners e.g. barking excessively at strangers passing. Require strategies such as environmental modification and conditioning but can usually be managed successfully. • Fear/anxiety problems e.g. fear-based aggression. These are much more complex due to emotional (i.e. unconscious) response • Modify behaviour using classical conditioning • Modify physical environment • Modify pharmacological environment Range of undesirable behaviours • Veterinary behaviourist consult • Significant cost - $400-$800 dollars but brings about some improvement in most cases • Will assess animals for underlying medical issues and dispense medication as needed • AVA has a special interest group (SIG) centred on behaviour, of which many specialists are members Seeking extra help – veterinary behaviourist • No registration or compulsory qualifications • Not able to dispense medication • Quality varies • Some trainers are excellent – follow best practice, refer to veterinary behaviourist as required (and behaviourist may refer to them in appropriate cases) • Most are good in operantly conditional training Seeking extra help – trainers Image:time.com • Rehoming can be a good solution in cases where environmental modification may change the outcome • Earlier stats on shelters demonstrate how often this is attempted • Careful vetting of potential owners to ensure they are aware of and willing to manage the issue • Euthanasia in behaviour cases needs to be an option where: • There is poor animal welfare for which the causes cannot be treated. This may be the best outcome for those animals • Where there is risk to human health When nothing helps –rehoming or euthanasia https://ethology.eu/can-two-training-methods-be-equally-good/Image: ontheprowlcatcartoons","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
