BL • Greater reliance on improved pastures and supplementary feeding https://www.agriculture.gov.au/sites/default/files/sitecollectiondocuments/animal-plant/animal-health/livestock-movement/sheep-movement-ead.pdfhttps://www.agriculture.gov.au/sites/default/files/sitecollectiondocuments/animal-plant/animal-health/livestock-movement/sheep-movement-ead.pdf Wool and lambAverage wool farm – not just wool http://data.daff.gov.au/brs/data/warehouse/pe_abarebrs99001233/aw06.1_wool.pdf Average meat goat farm • Highly variable – changes from relatively small Boer goat farm with a few hundred animals up to 10,000+ feral goats managed in pastoral country using goat fencing to keep goats in and harvest at regular intervals • Actual size of feral goat population not entirely certain – working on aerial survey data Average goat fibre farm • Average size of Mohair (Angora) farms relatively small ie. Hundreds of goats, frequently peri-urban, although some larger farms • Size of Cashmere also relatively small for higher quality Cashmere goats albeit cashmere also on feral goats so may be opportunistically collected Average dairy goat farm • 68 licensed dairy goat farms in Australia in 2018 • Average herd size 96 • Median number of goats per farm = 150 • Average production per goat = 2.5 litres per day • 60% sold as cheese, 18% as fresh milk and remaining as powder and other products • Likely total herd about 30,000 goats in 2018 but some larger operations commencing with 1000s of goats • These figures are significant increase on 2009 figures and don’t include small goat milking for personal use Sheep dairying • Most enterprises milk less than a few hundred ewes and produce specialty cheeses and other products • https://www.stockandland.com.au/story/6725926/ever-thought-of- milking-sheep/ • https://www.pecoradairy.com.au/about-us-1 • However larger scale enterprises can milk multiple thousand ewes per daymer","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
