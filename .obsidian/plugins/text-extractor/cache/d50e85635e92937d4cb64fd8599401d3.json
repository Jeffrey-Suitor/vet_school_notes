She also was the Animal Welfare Officer at Macquarie University for several years. Since coming to the Melbourne Veterinary School, Chris has taught first to third year veterinary students in a wide range of subjects, predominantly within the disciplines of veterinary anatomy and physiology. Email: cmmurray@unimelb.edu.au INTENDED LEARNING OUTCOMES At the end of this lecture, students should be able to: • describe the organisation of the mammalian urinary system and its anatomical relationships with surrounding tissues and organs • classify and distinguish the kidneys of the major domestic animal species • describe the structure of the nephron and the arrangement of the vascular components of the kidneys, and relate these to the gross appearance of the sectioned kidney • describe the structure of each of the components of the lower urinary system: ureters, bladder and urethra • explain how each component of the lower urinary system contributes to urine storage and expulsion.

These organs are responsible for the production and discharge of urine, and thus participate in stabilising body fluid composition and volume, as well as regulation of blood pressure and acid-base balance. Components of the urinary system are also involved in erythropoiesis (production of red blood cells) and activation of Vitamin D. The morphology of the components in the urinary system determines the functions of this system. This lecture describes the structure and anatomical relationships of the components of this system, and introduces their functions, in preparation for further lectures that explore the functions of this system in detail.
