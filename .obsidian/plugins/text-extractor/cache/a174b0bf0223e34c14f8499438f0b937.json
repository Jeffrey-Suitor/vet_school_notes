The Year Book Australia 1901-07 records:... during the years immediately succeeding the first settlement, the growth of the number of livestock was slow and notwithstanding importations from India and the Cape of Good Hope, the total of the herd amounted in 1800 to 1,044 cattle. During the next fifty years, however, the pastoral industry made rapid strides and at the end thereof (1850) the total reached 1,894,834.This growth was to continue for the next 50 years and by 1900 the beef cattle herd had climbed to 8.6 million head.\" from https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Previousproducts/1301.0Feature%20Articl e232005 Arrival of Bos indicus • Brahmans arrived in QLD in 1930s via CSIR • Better able to cope with heat and ticks • Brahman genetics in approximately 50% of national herd, mostly in northern half of the continent • More than 70% of bulls north of tropic of Capricorn are Brahman infused • Gilruth was responsible for original recommendation (Gilruth library at Werribee) • Importance of extension (graph) - Belmont Total Australian beef herd How many of each breed? • How do we work this out? • Stud versus commercial numbers? • Very small percentage of total Why so many breeds? • When we talk dairy cattle very limited breeds, but also in very defined area • Range of niche markets for beef and range of environments • Lower infrastructure costs for beef • Shifts in preferred beef breed type over time – significant change to black cattle • British breed registrations dominated by Angus, Hereford, Shorthorn, Murray Grey and Red Angus • Tropical breed registrations by Brahman, Droughmaster, Santa Gertrudis, Brangus • New breeds include Speckle Park that has increased rapidly • Very helpful to be able to identify breeds • Have a look at breed website (link on LMS following this) • Far more breeds than those listed here – have a look at https://breeds.okstate.edu/cattle/index.html % Bos indicus and Bos taurus and crossbreeds • Not all cattle are purebred • Crossbred has a number of potential benefits • Can crossbreed between Bos indicus and taurus (technically subspecies) • Can vary percentage of Bos indicus to environment e.g. common to have 3/8th or 5/8th Bos indicus (Brangus, Braford, Charbray etc), lower percentage further south • Crossbreeding utilises hybrid vigour • Simple two breed cross or can be far more complex with long term multiple breed program Crossbreed example • Use an Angus mated to a Hereford (or vice versa) to produce a “black baldy” – black cow with white face • Often on Angus herds may join young female first few times to Angus and then to terminal sire such as Charolais – all progeny from that mating to be sold ie none kept as replacements • Most commonly see 3 or maybe 4 breeds maximum in breed program","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
