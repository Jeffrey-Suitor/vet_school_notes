What activates the intrinsic and extrinsic cascades? • Which is considered to be more important in activation coagulation in vivo: the intrinsic or the extrinsic pathway? • Why can an animal be deficient in some intrinsic system coagulation factors and yet not be predisposed to haemorrhage? • What are the major regulatory mechanisms that oppose haemostasis? Are all of these mechanisms essential? • What is meant by the terms fibrinolysis, fibrin degradation products, plasmin and plasminogen activators?
