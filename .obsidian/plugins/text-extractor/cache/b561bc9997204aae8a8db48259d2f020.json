Do not jump ahead. • This file gives you detailed instructions for completing each activity. Ask your tutor if you have any questions. • For some activities, you will be asked to record your answers to the questions by typing them into this file. You should save this PDF file each time you complete one of these questions, to make sure that your work does not get lost. Guidelines for effective Group work Your group will work at its best when everyone feels comfortable and “safe” to contribute to discussion. Here are a few suggestions that might help promote a safe and effective group work environment: • Ensure that you all know one another’s names- and that you use them during your conversations. • Effective listening is a key to effective group work. Respectful listening enhances a positive group dynamic, and creates a space where it is safe for all to contribute. • Taking time to discuss is really important- discussing involves questioning and responding, reviewing and reflecting, sharing understanding. This is where deep learning occurs. It can often be greatly enhanced by visualisation- by sharing of ideas, summaries and processes on your white board and by collective rephrasing and reframing of ideas. • Sharing of tasks and responsibilities is also important in group work. Perhaps make a roster and each week have a different group member take responsibility for the keyboard, and for completing your interactive pdf. 3 instructions Enter each group member’s name, Iand email address below. After you have completed working through this document, save a copy and follow the instructions at the end of the document to share it with your group via the LMS or email. GROUP NUMBER Name Email Address 4 learninG objectives This clinical case scenario is designed to integrate and enhance your learning in Cells to Systems. It utilizes a real life case from veterinary practice to illustrate some of the concepts you have encountered in the course and the practical application of them. These cases are designed to stimulate thinking and discussion amongst yourselves and for this reason are delivered in a small group format. If there are words you do not understand, please note them down and research their meaning using a veterinary dictionary! scenario Mrs. Gillespie comes into your veterinary clinic one day with her 12 year old, female, neutered cat Bella. Normally Bella is a fairly quiet cat, but recently Mrs Gillespie reports she seems to have become obsessed with food, sitting by the refrigerator constantly meowing and demanding to be fed. When offered food she immediately gulps it down ravenously, but from time to time she vomits it back up. On the other hand, despite her healthy appetite, Mrs. Gillespie has noticed that Bella seems to be losing weight… 5 QUESTION 1 • Identify and make a list of Bella’s main problems and for each problem make a subsidiary list of how it may be caused using a systematic approach. One approach might be to decide which body systems are potentially involved in each identified problem. Another approach might be to think about different disease processes e.g. infection, cancer. Combinations of approaches are also possible. We will call each item on these subsidiary lists a differential diagnosis. For each differential diagnosis discuss and summarize how it may be causing the identified problem. 6 An example of a differential diagnosis list using the VINDICATE mnemonic, which describes underlying pathological (disease causing) mechanisms. Coughing in a dog - a reflex initiated by irritation of the airways. • Vascular causes: left sided congestive heart failure (secondary pulmonary oedema) • Infectious causes: “kennel cough” (infectious tracheobronchitis), pneumonia (primary bacterial, secondary e.g. aspiration) • Neoplasia: lung cancer (compression and inflammation of the airways) • Drugs: • Idiopathic (unknown causes): • Congenital: hypoplastic trachea (physical obstruction) • Autoimmune or Anatomical: bronchitis (inflammation of the lower airways), collapsing trachea (physical obstruction and inflammation) • Trauma or Toxins: tracheal foreign body (inflammation of the trachea), warfarin (pulmonary haemorrhage) • Endocrine: ? QUESTION 2 What further information, which might be obtained from questioning Mrs. Gillespie, will help you decide between your differential diagnoses? Discuss your reasons for asking these particular questions. 7 history Mrs. Gillespie reports that she acquired Bella as a kitten at the age of 3 months. She had her course of kitten vaccinations at that time, but has not received regular re- vaccination since then. She was neutered at 6 months of age and has not had any health problems up until recently; in fact she hasn’t been to a vet since she was neutered! She is on a monthly flea control preparation (fipronil) but hasn’t been dewormed for years. She is normally fed on a mixture of canned and dry Whiskas® food. She is primarily an indoor cat but does go outside occasionally for brief periods of time. Mrs. Gillespie first noticed problems with Bella about two months ago. Whenever she spotted her opening the fridge (where the canned food is kept once opened) she would rush up and curl herself around her legs meowing intensely. When she then gave her food she would eat ravenously. In the last week she has vomited up largely undigested food on three separate occasions within an hour of eating. There has been no signs of any diarrhoea, although the amount of stool she is producing has increased. Mrs. Gillespie has also noticed that Bella seems to be more active than normal and paces around the house meowing for no obvious reason. She has noticed her coat has become spiky and unkempt in appearance. 8 QUESTION 3 • Summarize the additional information obtained from the history. • Based upon this information look back at your previous list of problems. Add any new problem you have identified together with a subsidiary differential diagnosis list, which includes your postulated underlying mechanism. • Look at the differential diagnoses lists you made previously – decide whether the differential diagnoses are more likely, less likely or can be excluded from your list. Provide an explanation for any changes. • What further information that you might obtain from a physical examination of Bella could help you refine your differential diagnoses? 9 physical examination Parameter Finding Normal value Weight kg 4.2 4.8 Body condition score 3/9 0 = emaciated, 5 = “normal”, 9 = obese Mucous membranes Pink with capillary refill time of 1s Pink with capillary refill time <2s Temperature °C 38.2 38.0 - 39.0 Pulse/minute 240 120-180 Respiratory rate/minute 24 10-30 Chest auscultation Left sided, grade 3/6, systolic heart murmur with regular heart rhythm.

You send the blood sample off for a “Geriatric Profile”. This is a series of tests looking for evidence of the existence of some of the more common diseases seen in older cats.

A reference interval describes the variation of a measurement or value in healthy individuals. 95% of a healthy (“normal”) population will have values within the reference interval and 5% will have values outside this range, yet still be “normal”. ALT is usually elevated as a result of leakage of the enzyme from the cytosol of damaged liver (hepatic) cells. Thyroxine (T4) is secreted by the thyroid gland. The thyroid is located in the region of the abnormal mass which was palpated in the ventral cervical region. QUIZ 2 Click back to the LMS and attempt Quiz 2 before continuing. QUESTION 5 • Summarize what you have found as a result of the tests above. • Looking back at your problem lists and your subsidiary differential diagnoses lists, are you able to connect the historical information, presenting signs, physical examination findings and results of the above tests to reach a diagnosis and an explanation for Bella’s problems? What will you tell Mrs. Gillespie? 13 the thyroid and thyroid hormone The results of the clinical pathology, together with the historical information, presenting signs and physical examination findings indicate that Bella is suffering from hyperthyroidism associated with overproduction of thyroid hormones by the thyroid gland in the neck. The thyroid gland is composed of two lobes joined together just beneath the thyroid cartilage (“Adam’s apple”). The normal function of the thyroid is illustrated and explained below. The basic functional unit of the thyroid gland is the thyroid follicle. The wall of the follicle is a single layer of thyroid cells, which synthesise thyroglobulin. The follicular lumen contains colloid. This is where the thyroglobulin secreted by the thyroid cells is stored. Thyroglobulin is the precursor of all thyroid hormones. Adequate ingestion of iodine is required for normal synthesis of thyroid hormones by the thyroid. Ingested iodine becomes iodide in the gastrointestinal tract, then travels in the circulation to the thyroid where it iodinates tyrosine residues within the thyroglobulin molecule to form mono-iodotyrosine (MIT) and di-iodotyrosine (DIT). MIT and DIT combine to form thyroxine (T4) or tri-iodothyronine (T3). These are stored in the thyroid gland until their release. T4 and a small amount of T3, is liberated from thyroglobulin by proteolysis and released from the thyroid into the circulation. Less than 1% of T4 circulates unbound in the plasma as free T4 (fT4). Greater than 99% of T4 circulates in the plasma bound to proteins and serves as a reservoir to maintain fT4 concentrations. fT4 enters the cells of the body where the biological effects of thyroid hormone are expressed. fT4 is de-iodinated to T3 which interacts with receptors on the cell membrane, mitochondria or nucleus of the cell to stimulate the physiologic actions of thyroid hormone. T3 can bind to cytoplasmic binding proteins which act as an intracellular storage pool for T3. • 14 functions of thyroid hormones Thyroid hormones are needed for the normal cellular metabolic functions of the body and are the primary determinants of basal metabolic rate. Increased amounts of thyroid hormones result in an increase in metabolic rate and a generalized catabolic state. Thyroid hormones affect many metabolic processes through a variety of actions: • influence the concentration and activity of numerous enzymes. • influence the metabolism of substrates, vitamins and minerals • influence the secretion and degradation rates of most other hormones and the response of their target tissues to them • critically important in foetal and neonatal development particularly of the nervous and skeletal systems • stimulate calorigenesis • stimulate protein and enzyme synthesis • stimulate carbohydrate and lipid metabolism including synthesis, mobilisation and degradation • marked positive chronotropic and inotropic effects on the heart potentially resulting in an increase in blood pressure • necessary for normal hypoxic and hypercapnoeic drive to the respiratory centres • stimulate erythropoiesis • stimulate bone turnover, increasing both the formation and resorption of bone QUIZ 3 Click back to the LMS and attempt Quiz 3 before continuing. QUESTION 6 • Look back at the problem list you made and the differential diagnoses you created for each problem on the list. Using your knowledge of thyroid hormone function are you now able to correlate your problem list with the metabolic effects of increased amounts of circulating thyroid hormones? 15 reGulation of thyroid hormone production Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) is the major regulator of thyroid hormone synthesis and secretion. TSH is secreted by the anterior pituitary gland situated at the base of the brain and stimulates production and release of T4 and T3 thyroid hormones from the thyroid gland. Excessive stimulation by TSH may result in hypertrophy of the thyroid gland. TSH production is modulated by the free thyroid hormones as a result of negative feedback. Release of TSH is stimulated by the production of TSH-releasing hormone (TRH) from the hypothalamus situated within the brain. Hypothalamic production and release of TRH are controlled by poorly understood neural pathways from higher brain centres. There appears to be little effect of thyroid hormones on TRH secretion from the hypothalamus. QUESTION 7 • Draw a schematic diagram of the regulation of secretion of thyroid hormone. 16 Detection of an enlarged thyroid gland in a cat Lamb with an enlarged thyroid gland (goitre) QUESTION 8 • The above pictures of Bella the cat and a lamb demonstrate enlargement of the thyroid gland. Using your knowledge of thyroid hormone production and regulation of thyroid production, devise different mechanisms by which thyroid enlargement may develop in these animals. 17 disorders of thyroid hormone production Hyperthyroidism in cats Hyperthyroidism is the most common endocrine disease of older cats. The majority of cases are the result of benign nodular hyperplasia of the thyroid gland, although occasionally thyroid carcinoma (malignant neoplasia) is encountered. The autonomous secretion of thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) by the hyperplastic tissue produces a negative feedback effect on the pituitary gland, suppressing the release of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and results in the atrophy of normal thyroid tissue. Unregulated synthesis and secretion of thyroid hormones in cats typically results in weight loss (despite a normal to increased appetite), behavioural changes such as hyperactivity and aggression, vomiting, diarrhoea and an increase in stool volume. The cardiovascular effects of increased thyroid hormones may be manifested as tachycardia, hypertension and the development of heart “murmurs” (abnormal heart sounds detected on auscultation). Congenital goitre in lambs Congenital goitre (swelling of the thyroid gland) is seen in new born lambs when the ewe has had an inadequate intake of iodine during pregnancy. Poor iodine intake may be a result of low pasture levels of iodine or the presence of “goitrogens” in the plants that the ewe is eating. Goitrogens act in different ways, some (the cyanogenetic goitrogens) act to block the uptake of iodine by the thyroid, others (the thiouracil-type goitrogens) prevent the incorporation of iodine into the thyroid hormones. In response to the low production of and hence low concentrations of thyroid hormones in the blood stream, the anterior pituitary releases more TSH, which has the effect of stimulating hypertrophy of the thyroid gland without a corresponding increase in thyroid hormone production. The thyroid gland enlarges but thyroid hormone concentrations remain low. In sheep iodine deficiency causes early foetal death, impaired brain function in lambs and stillbirth. Lambs that do survive birth are less likely to bond with their mother and have retarded growth. During cold weather they are unable to mobilize fat to produce heat and this results in high mortality. Many of the changes in the foetus resulting from iodine deficiency are irreversible after birth. While iodine supplements can reduce the size of the thyroid and increase thyroid hormone production, the developmental changes, such as impaired brain function and a reduction in wool follicles are permanent. Prevention of iodine deficiency is a much better management strategy to treatment and consists of supplementing the diet with iodine where there is a history of iodine deficiency or in livestock grazing white clover or brassica plants, which may contain goitrogens. QUIZ 4 Click back to the LMS and attempt Quiz 4 before continuing. 18 QUESTION 9 • Devise strategies for the treatment of the hyperthyroidism we have diagnosed in Bella. • Outline the rationale for your treatment options. Hint: think about ways you could reduce synthesis of thyroid hormones or remove the abnormal tissue. 19 treatment of feline hyperthyroidism There are several options for the treatment of hyperthyroidism in cats, each with its own advantages and disadvantages: 1.Surgical removal of the affected thyroid gland under a general anaesthetic. This results in a permanent cure provided all the affected thyroid tissue is removed. However, post operative complications such as hypocalcaemia (low blood calcium) can occur as a result of damage to the parathyroid glands (adjacent to the thyroid glands) at the time of surgery. In addition thyroid tissue can occur at other locations in the neck and this tissue may also be active or develop nodular hyperplasia at a later date resulting in a recurrence of the clinical signs after surgery. 2.Administration of drugs that reversibly inhibit production of thyroid hormones. Drugs such as carbimazole block the production of thyroid hormones and are comparatively inexpensive as a short term treatment. However, lifelong administration is required, together with follow up blood tests to monitor the effectiveness of treatment, which potentially results in a greater lifetime cost compared with other treatment modalities. Adverse reactions to the drug occasionally occur, but the greatest problem with drug therapy is owner and cat compliance! 3.Administration of radioactive iodine. The thyroid gland is unable to distinguish between stable and radioactive iodine. Following administration, radioactive iodine is concentrated by functioning thyroid cells, which it then irradiates and destroys. 131-I is the radioisotope most commonly used. It has a half-life of 8 days and emits both beta-particles and gamma- radiation. The beta-particles, which cause 80% of the tissue damage, travel a maximum of 2 mm. They are locally destructive but spare adjacent atrophied thyroid tissue and other cervical structures. After administration the cat must be housed in a restricted area and the urine and faeces collected and disposed of as radioactive waste for about a week until radiation levels have subsided to a safe limit. Administration of 131-I is a safe and effective treatment for hyperthyroidism (although see notes re renal function below), although it has a higher initial cost compared with other treatments. 4.Feeding a very low iodine diet. A diet very low in iodine (Hills y/d diet) can result in a return to euthyroidism (normal thyroid levels). 5.No treatment! Sometimes owners are unable to afford the cost of treatment and opt to leave their cat untreated. Without treatment, cats with hyperthyroidism usually die of concurrent renal disease, heart disease, liver disease, or hypertension within months to years. However, cats treated for hyperthyroidism, which have underlying kidney failure may also experience a deterioration in renal function as a result of a reduction in circulating thyroid hormones. Where underlying kidney dysfunction is suspected, trial treatment with drugs may be initiated and kidney function monitored for deterioration, before a decision regarding ongoing treatment is made. You discuss the various treatment options with Mrs Gillespie. She explains that it is very hard to give Bella any medication in tablet form and this is one of the reasons she has not been able to worm her in the past (as she revealed to you in the history). She opts for treatment with radioactive iodine, although she is concerned that he will be isolated on his own for a week after treatment. You state that you are happy with Bella’s kidney function after reviewing the results of his previous blood and urine tests and will refer her to the University of Melbourne Veterinary Hospital for treatment. 20 QUESTION 10 • Looking back at the blood and urine tests performed previously, which tests have you taken into consideration when assessing Bella’s kidney function as being satisfactory? 21 bella in hospital At the University Veterinary Hospital Bella is admitted for treatment. She is lightly sedated and given a capsule of 138 MBq (megabecquerel) of 131-I by mouth. She is placed in isolation in the Radiation Ward, where she is monitored over the following week. A week after treatment Bella’s radiation levels have reached an acceptable “safe” level of 12.1 microSv/hr. She is allowed home on the proviso that Mrs Gillespie limits close contact with her over the next week to less than 30 minutes a day. 22 bella back home You recheck Bella four weeks after discharge from the University Veterinary Hospital. Mrs Gillespie reports that she has been doing very well at home. She has retained a good appetite but is no longer obsessed with food and doesn’t harass her nearly as much when she goes near the refrigerator. When you examine Bella you find her body condition score has now increased to 5/9 (from 3/9), her weight has increased to 4.7kg (from 4.2kg) and her hair coat looks much better groomed. Her heart rate has reduced to 160 beats per minute (from 240), her heart murmur is now barely audible (grade 1/6 from 3/6) and her blood pressure has reduced to 150 mm Hg (from 180). You take a blood sample to check her total T4 (thyroxine) concentration and her biochemistry values. You receive the result back later on in the day. The T4 is now 17 nmol/l (reference interval = 15 - 45, pretreatment concentration = 127) and the ALT (alanine aminotransferase) value is now 74 IU/l (reference interval 5 - 80, pretreatment value 143). QUESTION 11 • If Bella’s post treatment total T4 was less than the reference interval is this likely to be a problem? What signs would Mrs Gillespie need to watch out for, which might suggest she required treatment? How would you treat her? 23 learninG objectives At the end of this exercise you should be able to: 1. Describe and be able to demonstrate the general approach to clinical problem solving. 2. Use the regulation and control of thyroid hormone secretion as an example to illustrate the body’s homeostatic mechanisms and mechanisms of communication. 3. Predict the effects of normal and abnormal thyroid function. 4. Relate abnormal thyroid function back to the clinical signs observed in a patient. 5. List the ways of treating thyroid abnormalities in the cat. further readinG Gunn-Moore D.
