Oesophagus pressed dorsally by mediastinal mass (lymph node). Abdominal oesophagus • Very short • Ventral surface indents the dorsal border of the liver • Joins the stomach dorsally at the cardia • Well developed cardiac sphincter in the horse – vomiting very rare Oesophagus - structure • Four main layers – Mucosa – Submucosa – Muscularis externa – Adventitia or serosa Mucosa Submucosa Muscularis externa Serosa Epithelium Muscularis mucosa Lamina propria Lumen Textbook of Veterinary Anatomy; Dyce, Sack and Wensing Oesophagus - Muscularis externa • Species variation – Pig, horse, cat • Cranially striated muscle, caudally smooth muscle – Dog, ruminant • Entirely striated muscle • Functional cranial and caudal sphincters Oesophagus • Blood Supply – Branches of the - • Common carotid a. • Bronchoesophageal a. • Left gastric aa. • Nerve Supply – Branches of the vagus and sympathetic nerves Birds • Oesophagus on right side of neck in cervical region. • crop - saccular diverticulum of oesophagus cranial to thoracic inlet.
