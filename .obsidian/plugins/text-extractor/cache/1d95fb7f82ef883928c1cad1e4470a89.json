The pre- and post-laboratory quizzes are part of the course assessment. 3 Werribee Campus Map (https://maps.unimelb.edu.au/werribee/building) 6 Figure 1 Parts of a microscope (7) To centre the field iris diaphragm, rotate the diaphragm ring counter clockwise to stop down the iris diaphragm to the minimum. (8) Rotate the condenser height adjustment knob in either direction until the image of the field diaphragm is sharply in the field of view. Bring the image of the field diaphragm into the centre of the field by use of the two screws used to centre the attachment lens located at the base of the condenser. Open the diaphragm until only a small ring of the diaphragm is visible in the field. If the polygonal ring is not concentric with the field of view, repeat the procedure. (9) The opening of the aperture iris diaphragm built in the condenser can be adjusted to match with the numerical aperture of the objective in use, in order to achieve optimum objective performance as depth of focus, image contrast and resolution. Turning the diaphragm lever counter clockwise reduces the diaphragm opening. Remove an eyepiece, and looking through the empty eyepiece tube, adjust the opening of the diaphragm. It is preferable to stop down the aperture diaphragm to 70-80% of the objective. If the specimen is pale further reduce the diaphragm opening to increase the contrast for better image observation. (10) This microscope is bifocal, which means once one objective is in focus; the other objectives can be swung around and clicked into place with only minor adjustment in focusing required. A note on the Oil Immersion Lens (not utilized in these classes) The oil immersion lens is a permanent part of the binocular microscope but should not be used without immersion oil. Please do not use this lens to view slides in these classes. 7 The aperture diaphragm is attached to the condenser lens and used to control resolving power, contrast and depth of focus. Aperture diaphragm Resolving power Contrast Depth of focus Brightness 100 % open High Low Shallow Bright 0 % open Low High Deep Dark At the beginning of each class, gently wipe the surface of each objective lens with lens tissue. Wipe clean each slide between examinations. Breathing on the slide may be necessary to clean it properly. At the end of each practical session cover the microscope with the cover provided and ensure that no slide remains on the stage. The instructions for this practical and links to view the slides will be given through a cloud-based learning platform called Lt, where you will be able to interact, analyse and take notes. You will receive an email to join the ‘Lt platform’. All you need to do is to click on the link and generate a password. Then you will be directed to the Lt instance, you can log in and see the content of the practical. 9 We recommend this program to support your learning in anatomy and it is also recommended by the diagnostic imaging team for your studies in future years. 10 Materials: On Canvas: • Images comparing the carpus and tarsus of the domestic species • Radiographs of the limbs of the dog and horse • Skeleton images from a variety of species In the Dissection Lab: • Bone boxes of the canine forelimb and hindlimb • Bone boxes of the canine lumbar vertebrae and pelvis • Articulated skeletons of the dog • Disarticulated manus and pes of the dog (normally located in the OBLA) • Articulated skeletons of the limbs of the horse, ox, pig (normally located in the OBLA) • Bone racks with individual bones from horse, ox, sheep, pig • Loose bones from forelimb and hindlimb of horse and ox In the OBLA: • Articulated skeletons of the pony, cow, sheep, pig, cat, chicken • Skeletal elements from non-domestic species. The answers to the questions in this practical class may be found in the lecture notes, these notes, the computer slides, the references, or may be deduced from careful observation. Not all questions will have a single “correct” answer. These questions are to encourage you to practice answering questions using logic, observation, deduction, and your own knowledge as this is a critical skill in veterinary practice. 11 PART 1. THE APPENDICULAR SKELETON The appendicular skeleton consists of the bones of the forelimbs and hindlimbs. For the activities in part 1, use the boxes of loose canine bones. For each major bone, establish their correct anatomical relationships and the side from which they came. Check the correctness of your conclusions about a particular bone by comparing it with the mounted skeletons and articulated limb. Forelimb The Pectoral Girdle A ‘girdle’ refers to the set of bones which attach a limb to the axial skeleton. The pectoral girdle, which connects the forelimb to the axial skeleton, comprises the scapula, coracoid, and clavicle in the ‘universal’ tetrapod body plan. These bones meet at the shoulder joint. In the domestic species, the scapula is the only fully developed bone of the pectoral girdle. The scapula in quadrupeds is a flat bone that lies laterally against the rib cage and extends caudally and dorsally from the shoulder joint. This shape provides a large surface area for muscle attachment while minimizing bone mass. In the dog, the clavicle is present as a small piece of cartilage and tendon (the clavicular intersection). In cats, this intersection often contains a small vestigial clavicle bone. The coracoid is reduced to a small protuberance, the coracoid process of the scapula. When the number of bones is reduced through evolution, the reduced bones may remain as a separate centre of ossification attached to adjacent bones. A centre of ossification is the site within a bone where bone formation begins in the foetus. Cartilage fills the gaps between the centres of ossifications. Bone continues to expand from this centre of ossification in young animals until the cartilage is completely replaced by bone at which point the bone is fully formed. This becomes important information when examining radiographs. In young growing animals, the cartilage between the centres of ossification (which are black on radiographs compared to the white colour of bone) need to be distinguished from fracture lines (also black) to ensure a correct diagnosis is reached. Names such as “coracoid process of the scapula” give a clue to expect an extra centre of ossification. Why? .……………………………………………………………………….. .………………………………………… Examine the orientation and relationships of bones in the canine forelimb using the articulated dog skeletons and the loose bones from the boxes. Using the language of anatomy and the diagrams provided, identify these features on the dog bones. They will be used in the comparative exercise later. Scapula: glenoid cavity, spine, acromion. Humerus: head, neck, greater and lesser tubercles, intertubercular groove, deltoid tuberosity, medial and lateral epicondyles. Radius Ulna: olecranon, anconeal process, lateral and medial coronoid processes. 12 Hindlimb The Pelvic Girdle The pelvic girdle consists of the os coxae, which is comprised of the left and right hip bones. Each hip bone is composed of four fused bones in the dog – the ilium, ischium, pubis, and acetabular bone. In an anatomically precise way, the term ‘pelvis’ refers to the pelvic region – both the os coxae and the sacrum together as well as the pelvic canal – and the ‘bony pelvis’ refers to the sacrum and ox coxae together. However, ‘pelvis’ in common usage refers to the os coxae. Examine the orientation and relationships of bones in the canine hindlimb using the articulated dog skeletons and the loose bones from the boxes. Locate the following boney features to practice applying the language of anatomy and to prepare for the later comparative exercise: Pelvis: pelvic canal, pelvic inlet, pelvic outlet, acetabulum, wing of ilium, iliac crest, ischiatic tuberosity, pubic symphysis. Femur: head, neck, greater and lesser trochanters, lateral and medial condyles, intercondylar fossa, extensor fossa. Patella (one of the sesamoid bones of the stifle joint) Tibia: tibial tuberosity. Fibula Manus and Pes Familiarise yourself with the arrangement of the bones of the manus (forefoot) and pes (hindfoot) of the dog by examining the mounted specimens, including the exploded manus and pes, and by consulting references. Carpals and tarsals: Note how many rows there are and how many bones are in each row. Observe their appearance on the radiographs - can you distinguish individual bones on the radiographs? Metacarpals, metatarsals, and phalanges: Note how many metacarpals and metatarsals are present compared to the number of digits. How many phalanges are in each digit? Sesamoids: Note which joints they are associated with. Identify them on a radiograph of these regions. Sesamoids are easily lost during the preparation of a mounted skeleton so there may be less bones on the mounted skeletons than observed in radiographs. It is important to be aware of the normal position, size, and number of sesamoids so they are not mistaken for fractures or abnormal bone fragments. As sesamoids occur in specific locations, it should be possible to recognise them as sesamoids with careful examination, even in an animal you have not encountered before. As with centres of ossification described above, a radiograph of the contralateral limb can help determine what is normal for that animal. You may find it helpful to label the images on the following pages. Remember to include the aspect and whether it is the left or right limb. 13 14 15 16 Limb function Fit a humerus, radius, and ulna together. Manipulate the bones to explore how particular movements are facilitated or limited by the articular surfaces and neighbouring features of bone structure. Consider how they may be involved in movements of the limbs. Think about how the forces of body support and locomotion may be distributed through these bones and identify potential areas of weakness. Where might you expect the humerus to break? What sort of force might make it crack? ……………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………. Where might you expect the bones that form the elbow joint to break? ……………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………. PART 2. THE AXIAL SKELETON The axial skeleton consists of the bones running along the long axis of the body. It consists of the fused bones of the skull, the mandibles, hyoid apparatus, vertebral column, ribs, and sternum. The skull The skull is examined Practical 1 in the Digestive System subject. Skeleton of the vertebral column The skeleton of the vertebral column – also known as the back or spine – has 5 regions: cervical (neck), thoracic (chest), lumbar (abdomen), sacral (pelvic), and caudal (tail). Label each region on the diagram. Identify the following vertebral features and label the vertebra diagram below (from: de Lahunta & Evans. Miller’s Anatomy of the Dog). • Body • Vertebral arch • Vertebral foramen • Spinous process • Transverse process • Articular process • Costal fovea – see skeleton of the thorax section below for more information about costal fovea. 17 You should be able to identify the region from which any vertebra comes, using the vertebrae features characteristic to each region. For example, the average size of spinous, transverse, and articular processes in each region are different sizes. You should also be able to recognise the atlas, axis, anticlinal vertebra, and sacrum by name. Using either the bone racks or one of the mounted specimens, examine a representative vertebra (usually a mid-region vertebra) from the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar regions. Which region has the longest spinous processes? ……………..……………………………………………. Which region has the longest transverse processes? …………………………..……………………………. The sacrum is the bone formed by the fusion of the sacral vertebrae. The dog has 3 sacral vertebrae in its sacrum. Using your knowledge of vertebrae features such as spinous processes, intervertebral discs, and vertebral foramina, determine the correct orientation of the sacrum and position it within the ox coxae. Each vertebra articulates with the vertebrae on either side of it. Caudal to C2, this articulation involves a fibrocartilagenous intervertebral disc between the vertebral bodies and synovial joints between the articular processes on the left and right of each vertebra. The synovial joints fit together so that each successive vertebra supports the one cranial to it, including C1 supporting the skull. Observe how the orientation of these articular surfaces changes as you move caudally through the vertebral column. Skeleton of the thorax The skeleton of the thorax comprises the thoracic vertebrae, the ribs, and the sternum. The ribs connect the vertebral column and the sternum, forming a protective yet movable cage that facilitates the breathing movements of the chest while safeguarding the lungs and heart within the thoracic cavity. Identify the bones of the thorax in the following drawing. Which non-thorax bones are present? Name some features that would help you to identify a particular area of the thorax on a radiograph. How might you find these in a live dog? ……………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………. ……………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………. 18 The thoracic vertebrae are the vertebrae that articulate with the ribs. What features help to distinguish thoracic vertebrae from lumbar or cervical vertebrae? ……………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………. …………………………………………………………………………………………………………….……………… How many thoracic vertebrae are there in the dog? …………………………………………………………………………………………………………….…………… When the soft tissues are present to connect the bones normally, what movements do you think the rib can make?...………………………………………………………………………………………………….……………… …………………………………………………………………………………………………………….……………… Can you feel the movements of your ribs against your spine? You may need assistance from a friend to feel this. When you get the chance, try to feel these movements in a quadruped e.g. a dog, cat, or horse. Which way do the ribs move in relation to the spine when breathing in?......................................................... And when breathing out?......................................................... The rib movements change the volume of the thoracic cavity. When the thoracic cavity is intact and sealed, pressures different to the atmospheric pressure can be maintained inside the thoracic cavity, air can be drawn into or pushed out of the lungs. Each rib articulates with two thoracic vertebrae in multiple places. The more cranial vertebra has a crater called the caudal costal fovea, as it is on the caudal edge of the vertebral body, and the caudal vertebra has a crater called the cranial costal fovea on the cranial edge of its vertebral body. Together these two foveae form the cup that holds the head of the rib. Travelling distally, the rib narrows to a neck then enlarges again to form the bulge of the tubercle of the rib. The tubercle articulates with a fovea on the transverse process of the vertebra. Using your knowledge of anatomical language, find the angle, the body, the costochondral junction, and the costal cartilage on a rib bone. The costal arch forms the caudal edge of the rib cage. It is the arch formed by the last rib and the successive costal cartilages that connect to the sternum. Feel your costal arch and compare its shape to the domestic species. If you palpate carefully, you should be able to feel the sequence of costal cartilages that connect to each other to form the costal arch. The sternum consists of a chain of bones called sternebrae. The first (most cranial) is the manubrium and the last (most caudal) has a xiphoid process that supports the flat plate of the xiphoid cartilage. Label these bones and cartilage on the drawing of the thorax above. 19 PART 3. COMPARATIVE ANATOMY Domestic species In the articulated limbs or the loose bones from the domestic species, observe the differing sizes and shapes of the limb bones as well as the features that you identified above. Scapula: glenoid cavity, spine, acromion. Humerus: head, greater and lesser tubercles, deltoid tuberosity, medial and lateral epicondyles. Radius Ulna: olecranon, anconeal process, lateral and medial coronoid processes. Examine the size of the ulna and radius relative to each other and to the humerus, the degree of fusion between the ulna and radius in the various domestic species. Pelvis: acetabulum, wing of ilium, iliac crest, ischiatic tuberosity, pubic symphysis. Femur: head, greater and lesser trochanters, lateral and medial condyles. Pay particular attention to the differing height of the greater trochanter between species. Tibia: tibial tuberosity Fibula Examine the size of the tibia and fibula relative to each other and to the femur, the degree of fusion between the tibia and fibula in the various domestic species. Metacarpus / tarsus: in each species: - which bones are present? - which bones are fused? - through careful observation, can you differentiate between the metacarpal and metatarsal bones in the ox and the horse? And left from right? Phalanges: in each species: - how many digits present? - which digits are weight bearing? - number of phalanges per digit? - shape of the distal phalanx (P3)? - number and location of proximal and distal sesamoid bones (particularly in the horse)? Examine the radiographs of the equine distal limb. Identify the 3 phalanges and associated sesamoids. 19 These images are from which species? Label the aspects shown. Non-domestic species Observe the pectoral and pelvic limb bones of the non-domestic species in the OBLA and in the document on Canvas e.g. elephant, giraffe, marsupial. In the different species, compare the key bones and features that you are now familiar with. Some of the features are either enormously enlarged or absent. What differences you can observe? Many differences occur in the pectoral girdle, which can be related to the many and varied uses of the forelimb in different species e.g. flying, digging, running. The scapula is present in all species. In what animals does the scapula appear more tubular than flattened?........................................................... When the clavicle is present, it extends medially and ventrally towards the ventral midline and may articulate with the manubrium of the sternum. When the coracoid is present, it extends medially, caudally, and ventrally towards the midline and may articulate with sternum. The coracoid and clavicle are only fully developed in reptiles, flying birds and monotremes. Which of the 3 pectoral girdle bones do humans have?....………………………………………………………… Also observe the different shapes and amounts of fusion in the ribs and sternum on mounted specimens. Can you relate any of the observed differences to the lifestyle or habitat of the animal? Do these features provide any advantages for locomotion or other functions? ………...……………………………………………………………………………………………………………. …...…...……………………………………………………………………………………………………………. …………...…………………………………………………………………………………………………………. …………...…………………………………………………………………………………………………………. 21 Definitions: Whole blood: Direct from the patient, uncoagulated. Contains cells, water, proteins and other solutes (e.g. glucose, salts etc) Plasma: The liquid portion of blood obtained by spinning down uncoagulated blood. Contains water, proteins, salts, hormones… everything except the cells Serum: The liquid portion of blood obtained by spinning down coagulated or clotted blood. The same as plasma except without proteins involved in clotting (clotting factors and fibrinogen) - these are ‘tied up’ in the clotting process. Ib. Sites of Collection In sheep, goats, cattle and horse the external jugular vein is the most commonly used. In dogs and cats the cephalic vein is the normal site of venepuncture (also the jugular vein), and the cephalic vein can also be used in the sheep. Pigs have so much subcutaneous fat that suitable superficial veins are hard to find. The cranial vena cava or one of the ear veins is used instead. Ic. Skin Disinfection To reduce the risk of infection, the skin overlying the vein must be cleaned. The area is swabbed with 4% chlorhexidine scrub, alternating with 80% alcohol three times. Id. Technique i. An assistant restrains the sheep. There are two acceptable methods: (a) the assistant straddles the sheep and lifts its head and neck upwards and to one side by placing one hand under its lower jaw. Backing the animal against something solid, e.g. a wall, will help, or (b) the sheep is sat up on its haunches, its back between your legs, and its head and neck held up with one hand. ii. The wool and skin are wet with 80% alcohol* and the wool overlying the jugular groove is clipped. *(The solution of 80% alcohol helps remove the grease from the wool and also facilitates clipping). iii. The skin is swabbed with 4% chlorhexidine scrub, alternating with 80% alcohol three times. iv. The thumb of your left hand (if right-handed) is placed into the jugular groove and pressed firmly to occlude blood flow through the jugular vein, thus raising the vessel so that it becomes distended and clearly visible. v. Tapping the distended vein with the middle finger of your right hand can identify the site of the vein under the skin. This produces a distinct pulsation. vi. If the grip of your thumb on the lower part of the jugular groove is released the fluctuation and swelling produced by engorgement of the released vein disappear. vii. The vein is raised again by pressure with the thumb of the left hand in the jugular groove. Entry into the vein will be helped by backward and downward pressure with the thumb of the left hand. This stretches the skin over the vein at the same time as you apply pressure to the vessel to distend it. Q (1) Why does the vein need to be occluded to be visible? 22 ………………………………………………………………………………………………………… ………………………………………………………………………………………………………… ……………………. viii. The syringe is held between thumb and the tips of your fingers. The bevel of the needle should face towards you as should the calibration marks of the syringe. The needle should be held at an angle of 30-45o to the skin surface, and the needle directed along the axis of the vein, towards the head. ix. The needle should then be pressed firmly, but gently, through the skin and into the vein. Sometimes a popping sensation or sudden give is felt when the needle enters the vein. When the needle is in the vein, the vein is kept distended with the thumb, while the blood is collected. Never withdraw blood excessively quickly. Q (2) Would you expect a pulse to be visible normally? ………………………………………………………………………………………………………… ………………………………………………………………………………………………………… ……………………. x. When the required volume of blood is collected the left thumb is removed, allowing the vein to collapse then the syringe and needle are withdrawn swiftly and evenly from the vein. Pressure is applied to the puncture site with a swab and hold for 30 – 60 seconds to halt the bleeding. xi. The hypodermic needle is removed from the syringe before gently expelling the blood into a tube. Q (3) Why should you remove the needle from the syringe when expelling the blood sample into the tube? ………………………………………………………………………………………………………… ………………………………………………………………………………………………………… ……………………. Ie. Processing of Blood If whole blood or plasma is required, then some form of anticoagulant must be added to the fresh blood to prevent the sample from forming an insoluble clot. There are four anticoagulants in common use: oxalates, sodium citrate, a potassium or sodium salt of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and heparin. The first three act by forming a complex with calcium, a necessary component of clotting. Heparin acts by preventing the action of thrombin on fibrinogen. The oxalates are toxic and should not be used in collecting blood for transfusion. In addition, oxalate precludes the use of blood for determination of non-protein nitrogen or urea nitrogen, due to the presence of the ammonium ion. Sodium citrate is used for anticoagulation at the rate of one part of 3.8% aqueous solution to 9 parts of blood. A mixture of citrates, (\"ACD\"), is used in blood transfusions. It consists of 1.37g sodium citrate dihydrate, 0.44g anhydrous citric acid and 1.447g hydrous 23 dextrose in distilled water, made to 100ml. ACD is used at a rate of one part to four parts of blood. If a citrate sample is used for routine haematology then the results need to be corrected for dilution of the blood sample. Heparin, a natural anticoagulant occurring in various tissues, is found abundantly in the liver. Heparin does not alter erythrocyte volume but can interfere with staining of leukocytes. Ten international units (1 int. unit = 0.0077mg of Na salt) per ml of blood will prevent clotting. EDTA is the preferred anti-coagulant for blood morphology studies, and the one you will use most commonly in practice. It is commonly used at 1.0 to 2.0mg/ml of blood. Excess EDTA will cause shrinkage of erythrocytes. The EDTA is a powder in the tube and thus there is no dilution effect on resultsleu. Blood Film Thin, well-stained blood films are essential for the examination and evaluation of erythrocytes and leukocytes. A good smear can be a very useful tool for a quick diagnosis – either in the laboratory or in a Veterinary practice. Blood smears can be prepared on slides or coverslips. The slide technique, i.e. a drop of blood on a slide that is smeared across that slide with another glass slide, is suitable for routine work. A coverslip technique is sometimes used for birds and reptiles. Task 1 Review the Clinical Skills Guide on Making a Blood smear and watch the video on Canvas LMS. The distribution of leukocytes is not uniform since the large white cells accumulate at the edges of the blood film, or the ‘feathered edge’. This is not a problem, so long as you know where to look for them! Task 2 Watch the video on how to examine a blood smear. This gives a clear procedure for identifying the regions of the smear, how to perform an initial survey, and how to do a differential cell count. APPROACH TO BLOOD SMEAR EXAMINATION 1. Low power scan (4-10x dry) - overall impression of the quality of the smear and stain 2. Feathered edge scan (4-10x dry) - large cells or organisms tend to be pushed towards the edge of the smear, however morphology of normal cells tend to be disrupted in this area. Check the feathered edge for the presence of: • large, abnormal cells in circulation (e.g. mast cells, leukaemia cells) • large blood parasites (e.g. microfilaria) • platelet clumping (common in cats) Note: if platelet clumps are found it is likely the automated platelet count and/or estimated smear count will be inaccurate. 24 3. Find the monolayer – also called the “counting area” (40x dry, 100x oil)  the monolayer is found between the streaky feathered edge zone and the thicker body of the smear (where cells are too close together and often overlap each other), typically one field of view from the feathered edge with the 10x lens  cells in the monolayer are separated or barely touching, and morphology is therefore able to be evaluated more easily  identification of abnormal morphology in areas outside the monolayer may be artefactual, e.g. red blood cells may appear to be spherocytes or echinocytes in the thicker body of the smear  detailed examination of the three cell lines (RBC, WBC, platelets) occurs in the monolayer. Leukocytes When creating a blood smear, different white blood cells will end up in relatively different areas of the monolayer according to their size and weight. So when evaluating the smear ensure you are in the monolayer, and that you cover a representative area of the monolayer (typically in a “battlement” pattern as shown in the image above “differential track”) to ensure your estimate will be as accurate as possible. Evaluation of WBC’s in the blood smear should include manual estimates of total white blood cell count and a differential, especially if you want to validate an automated analysis or you do not have access to an automated analyser, and evaluation of cell morphology e.g. check for toxic change, left shift, atypical cells, parasites etc. Estimated total white cell count (WCC) from the smear: - Count number of leukocytes in 10 high power fields (40x) - Calculate average number of leukocytes per high power field (i.e. divide total by 10) - Multiply by 2 to get an estimated WCC in units 109/L to compare to reference intervals Feathered edge Monolayer Differential track Patient Blood Smear 25 The estimated WCC can be used to confirm the haematology analyser WCC result. Differential white cell count from the smear: - Following the battlement pattern count 100 consecutive white blood cells using high power (40x or 100x) and categorise them into whether they are neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils or basophils - Note any unusual or atypical cells or morphology, such as bands, metamyelocytes, mast cells, reactive lymphocytes, toxic change, and atypical leukocytes. - The percentage value must then be used to create an absolute value, as the significance of the proportion will depend on the total white cell count: e.g. if the estimated WCC = 10.4 x 109/L and differential shows neutrophils at 70% then the actual (or absolute) neutrophil proportion is 0.70 x 10.4 = 7.28 x 10 9/L Erythrocytes You will learn more about evaluating erythrocytes in Veterinary Bioscience: Respiratory System in semester two. When evaluating erythrocytes you should evaluate density, size, shape, colour, formation and check for presence of inclusions. Erythrocyte size and shape varies amongst species. Platelets Examination of platelets should include evaluation of the number of platelets present and checking the smear for clumps, particularly in the feathered edge. Morphology of platelets is often variable particularly in cats (including large platelets) and they are prone to clumping which leads to falsely low analyser platelet counts and smear estimates. You will learn more about evaluating platelets in Veterinary Bioscience: Respiratory System in semester two. Identification of leukocytes in domestic species There are 5 main types of leukocytes that can be identified in common domestic species using Wright’s Giemsa or Diff Quik stain: • Neutrophils – generally have a segmented or multi-lobed nucleus and neutral staining cytoplasm (hence the name neutrophil). These are the most common leukocytes in the blood of most domestic species other than ruminants. Mature neutrophils have multiple lobes or segments, while immature neutrophils (band neutrophils) have simpler, less-segmented nuclei. • Lymphocytes – these are round cells with a nucleus that takes up most of the cell and that often has a slight indentation. The cytoplasm stains pale blue. These are the next most common blood leukocyte type in domestic species, and the most common type in ruminant blood. • Monocytes – larger cells with a nucleus that can range from oval to varying degrees of indentation from single kidney bean shape to multiple indentations and lobular shapes. The cytoplasm is blue-grey and can contain vacuoles. Monocytes usually are less than 10% of the blood leukocytes. • Eosinophils – these have a segmented or multi-lobed nucleus, that is less defined than a neutrophil nucleus. Eosinophils are rare in normal blood of most species. The cytoplasm stains pale blue but is generally obscured by granules that stain reddish to orange (eosin-loving). The shape and colour of the granules differ between species. 26 o Dog granules are round and variable in number o Cat granules are rod shaped and fill the cytoplasm o Horse granules are large, round or oblong and fill the cytoplasm, often hiding the nucleus o Ruminant granules are small, round and fill the cytoplasm • Basophils – similar in size to neutrophils but very rare in the blood of most species. They have a segmented nucleus and a light purple cytoplasm (basic staining). The granules may or may not be visible, depending on the stain used and the species. o Dog granules have low numbers of small purple granules o Cat granules are small, oval and lavender o Horse and ruminant granules are small, numerous and purple and may obscure the nucleus Task 3 Examine smears from common domestic species and draw diagrams of the main cell types you can find. You can take screen shots as well but drawing the cells will help you to remember the main features. Describe the general appearance of each cell type and note both the similarities and differences between species. This will provide you with your own resource of images that you can build on as you progress through the course. The images are reached in the Slice database by the following hyperlinks: Normal sheep http://www.best.edu.au/s/5zq4sg5d Normal cow http://www.best.edu.au/s/ra9v5tar Normal dog http://www.best.edu.au/s/d8ducpzu Healthy cat http://www.best.edu.au/s/ekj7kjgz (has a mild eosinophilia) Normal horse http://www.best.edu.au/s/nwgjlzga Resources to help identify leukocytes: 1) Canvas LMS prac folder contains images of each leukocyte type for these species “Comparative leukocyte morphology” 2) The College of Veterinary Medicine at Cornell University has an excellent online resource of images for identifying and contrasting leukocyte morphology, and is available at: https://eclinpath.com/atlas/hematology/different-species/ 3) The MSD Veterinary Manual also has a library of images and is available at: https://www.msdvetmanual.com/circulatory-system/hematopoietic-system- introduction/white-blood-cells-in-animals Task 4 Perform differential leukocyte counts on the five digitised blood smears: 1) Choose a magnification that allows you to both scan across the image quickly and identify cells. You may have to zoom in if the cell is hard to identify. 2) Begin the count by moving back and forth across the smear in a battlement pattern that avoids covering the same territory (and that keeps you in the optimal viewing area as much as possible). This can be done by moving sideways across the slide in one direction, then down to the next field and moving back across the slide in the other direction. Identify each leukocyte that is encountered until 100 cells have been 27 counted and sorted by type, giving you a percentage of each cell type or a relative differential leukocyte count. 3) Calculate the absolute count for each cell type (% x Total WBC count). e.g. If % lymphocytes is 20% and the animals total WBC count is 10 x 109/L the absolute count for lymphocytes is 20% x10 = 2x109/L Record your results in the tables below.

She has a fever and a tense caudal abdomen. You run haematology on your clinic analyser and prepare a blood smear. The analyser has provided you with a differential count, however there are instrument flags suggesting it is inaccurate due to the presence of suspected band neutrophils (immature neutrophils with a U-shaped nucleus) and toxic change (blue tinting of the cytoplasm due to increased RNA associated with immaturity). Evaluate the haematology results below and the scanned blood smear and perform a manual differential count then calculate the absolute counts using the total WBC count from the analyser. Find some band and metamyelocyte neutrophils in the smear (examples shown below). Note that the monocyte is the larger and bluer than the neutrophils and bands. http://www.best.edu.au/s/pmsvrjvd Lymphocyte Monocyte Band neutrophils with toxic change Neutrophils 30 Haematology Manual differential % Manual absolute count Analyser Results Reference Values Red cell count x 10 12/L 4.5 5.5 – 8.5 Haemoglobin g/L 100 120 – 180 Haematocrit L/L 0.28 0.37 – 0.55 Platelets x 10 9/L 500 200 – 500 White cell count x 10 9/L 135.0 6.0 – 17.0 Metamyelocytes x 10 9/L 0 Bands x 10 9/L 0 – 0.3 Neutrophils x 10 9/L 108.4# 3.0 – 11.5 Lymphocytes x 10 9/L 8.1# 1.0 – 4.8 Monocytes x 10 9/L 17.5# 0.2 – 1.4 Eosinophils x 10 9/L 0 0.1 – 1.3 Basophils x 10 9/L 0 < 0.1 Total protein (ref.) g/L 102 60 - 80 # Potential differential error due to suspect bands/toxic change What process do the blood smear findings and haematology results suggest is going on in this bitch?

Elsevier Mosby, St Louis, USA (2017), pp. 286-321. 62 In today’s computer-aided learning session we will investigate the pharmacological manipulation of electrically-evoked muscle responses at the neuromuscular junction. The Preparation The experimental procedure involves a commonly used preparation in studies investigating the ‘neuromuscular junction’ (a term we use to describe the synapse between a motor neurone and skeletal muscle), the rat phrenic nerve-hemidiaphragm. The diaphragm is composed of skeletal muscle and the phrenic nerve is a conventional motor neurone. The preparation is maintained in an appropriate buffer/nutrient solution (Krebs solution) and is arranged so that the phrenic nerve can be electrically stimulated and that contraction of the skeletal muscle can be measured via a tension transducer (Figure 2). The stimulator can also be switched so that it directly stimulates the skeletal muscle, causing muscle contraction without phrenic nerve activity. This can be a useful tool for investigating the site of action of a particular drug (i.e. is the drug affecting muscle or nerve function?). Drugs of known concentrations can be added directly to the organ bath and, as the organ bath volume is known, the final drug concentration can be calculated. Today we will investigate the effects of FIVE different drugs on the hemidiaphragm’s contractile response to phrenic nerve stimulation. These are: • Tubocurarine o a nicotinic cholinoceptor antagonist (a component of a South American Indian arrow poison) used as a skeletal muscle relaxant o competitively prevents activation of the nicotinic ACh receptor • Atropine o a muscarinic cholinoceptor antagonist • Neostigmine o an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor o increases the effectiveness of ACh released from the nerve • Tetrodotoxin o a voltage-operated Na+-channel blocker derived from a marine bacterium • Suxamethonium o an agonist at nicotinic cholinoceptors but acts as a skeletal muscle relaxant… ??

The Rat Phrenic Nerve-Hemidiaphragm Preparation 63 Experimental Protocols The software package “Virtual Twitch” (developed by The University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, Scotland) will be made available in the Practical class session via MyUniApps. If the link above doesn’t work, copy and paste the following into a web browser https://students.unimelb.edu.au/campus-life/campuses-and-facilities/elearning-and-it/myuniapps When starting the myUniApps for the first time, you will be asked to install Citrix Receiver if not already present on your computer. Just follow the instructions on screen. Visit the myUniApps FAQ for more detailed setup instructions. To install Virtual Twitch: Log in with your University account and choose either Citrix Receiver (this option needs Citrix Receiver installed, which is also available - see above) OR Light version (stream within the browser). Once open, click on ‘APPS’ next to home button at top of page and then Locate 'Twitch V22' (see screen grabs below). This might take a couple of minutes to load as it is streaming down Virtual Twitch to the endpoint. Alternatively, the software (Virtual Twitch) can be downloaded onto your own PC (or cross-platform Mac) from the originators site at Uni Strathclyde: http://spider.science.strath.ac.uk/sipbs/page.php?show=software_sims 64 Getting Started • Select the Twitch folder and open the programme Twitch. • You will be prompted to enter your name/group – you do not have to do this. • The file menu is used to start a new preparation in the case of the tissue showing signs of loss of activity due to prolonged stimulation or the addition of a drug with a mechanism of action that is slow to diminish even after washing. • The drugs menu contains a list of 6 pharmacological agents - we will study 4-5 of these but you are welcome to explore the activities of the other agents if you have time today (or in your own time). Some information on what these drugs do can be found in the help menu and a more detailed description can be found in any good Pharmacology textbook (e.g. Rang & Dale’s Pharmacology., 9th edition). • We will not explore the ions menu today - again this can be done in your own time if desired. • There are 2 options in the wash menu - today we will use Normal Krebs washes only. • The options menu controls the trace and background colours. • The help menu has information on the drugs used in the experiments as well as information on the preparation etc. • At the bottom right hand corner of the box you will see the stimulator controls- ensure that the stimulator is set on Nerve (indirect). The stimulator will electrically excite the phrenic nerve at a set frequency and impulse strength - this cannot be varied in the experiment. • Click on start - immediately you will see diaphragm contractions (twitches) of around 60 g tension occurring. You can move the mouse cursor around to measure the magnitude of the muscle-twitch responses (tension values and time (seconds) are shown at the bottom left hand side of the screen). • In real life experiments of this kind, obtaining a twitch response to phrenic nerve stimulation is an important event that confirms that the sometimes tricky dissection has been a success. You are now ready to start experimentation! 65 Experiment 1 The effect of tubocurarine on neurally-evoked skeletal muscle contraction. After starting stimulation of the phrenic nerve, watch the level of skeletal muscle contraction to ensure it is relatively consistent. Sometimes tissues take some time to equilibrate to their new in vitro conditions. Take an average measurement of the basal muscle contractions you observe (enter the values obtained in the table below). You are going to construct a concentration-inhibition curve, where the concentration of tubocurarine will be altered and its effects on muscle contraction induced by nerve stimulation measured. • From the drugs menu select tubocurarine. Then select the concentration of 1x10-7 M (NB: if any concentration is not immediately available it can be directly typed into the concentration window) and select “inject drug”. Monitor the contractions you observe and when they have reached a consistent level take a few readings (using the cursor), enter them into the table on the next page and then average the contractions. • Select Normal Wash from the wash menu and wash the tissue 5 times - you can do this one after the other. You will notice that the response returns to the basal readings. • From the drug menu select tubocurarine and select 3x10-7 M. Allow the effect of the drug to reach a plateau, take a contraction reading and repeat the washing steps. • Repeat this process for tubocurarine concentrations of 5x10-7M, 1x10-6M, 3x10-6 M and 5x10-6 M (NB: do not wash out after the last concentration has reached is maximum effect). • After the last concentration has produced is maximum effect, switch the stimulator to muscle (direct) setting.  What do you observe? • NB: Once complete, return the stimulator to nerve (indirect) and wash the preparation 4 times with normal Krebs. 66 Tubocurarine (M) Tension (g) (take a few readings when the response has plateaued) Average Tension (g) (take an average of the readings in the previous column) Inhibition (%) 0 (basal readings) 1x10 -7 3x10 -7 5x10 -7 1x10 -6 3x10 -6 5x10 -6 Direct Muscle Stimulation Often we express inhibition data as the % inhibition achieved. This can be calculated directly as: ((Basal Tension –Tension in presence of drug)/Basal tension) x 100 For example: Basal tension = 60 g Tension in presence of tubocurarine = 40 g % inhibition = ((60-40)/60) x 100 = 33 %  Sketch a log concentration - inhibition (%) curve for tubocurarine. (NB: You sketch does not need to be highly accurate- but take care if you decide to use Excel.. are the spacings on the X-axis appropriate?) This video might be helpful for you to consider. On the demonstration using semi-log graph paper, note the position of the 3 x 10X concentrations.. they are in the middle between the 1 x 10x concentrations. Use this to make your sketch easier. From this curve we can calculate a value called the inhibitory concentration 50%, otherwise known as the IC50. This corresponds to the concentration of drug required to reduce the tissue response by 50% of the maximum. Using the same methodology that you have used to estimate EC50 values, estimate the IC50 value of tubocurarine from the graph. Validate your answer by examining your raw data.  Estimated IC50 value tubocurarine = Questions 1. What happened to the response after the tubocurarine was washed out of the organ bath? What might this suggest about the type of antagonism that tubocurarine is demonstrating? 67 2. In another experiment we add varying concentrations of the neurotransmitter ACh directly to the muscle preparation without stimulating the nerve. The contractions are measured, and a concentration-response curve generated for ACh. i) What shape of curve might arise from conducting this experiment if the concentrations of Ach are expressed in log10 form? Sketch it on the exes below- make sure you label the axes appropriately. (look at the earlier video to help with this) The ACh is washed from the organ bath, and tubocurarine (10-6 M) is then added to the muscle preparation. The concentration-response curve to ACh is then repeated but this time in the presence of tubocurarine (10-6 M). ii) What effect would you expect tubocurarine to have on the ACh log concentration-response curve generated above? Draw this on the axes below and consider if/why the two curves are different. 3. Despite the continued presence of tubocurarine and the almost complete blockade of neurally- mediated skeletal muscle contraction, the diaphragm was still able to contract maximally when the tissue was stimulated directly. Why is this? Explain this mechanistically using your understanding of the skeletal muscle contraction. 68 Experiment 2 The effect of atropine on neurally-induced skeletal muscle contraction • Look at the basal contraction of the diaphragm to nerve stimulation - it should be around 60 g of tension. • Using the same protocol as described above obtain a concentration-response relationship to the drug atropine. This time select the concentrations 1x10-7, 1x10-6, 1x10-5, 1x10-4, 1x10-3 M. Use the table on the next page to compile your data. • NB: as you do this, consider the concentration of atropine you are using and how fast you might expect to see an effect of the drug- i.e. if you have a hypothesis, skip ahead in the concentration-response to test this. Questions 1. Are you able to determine an IC50 value for atropine? Are you able to determine if atropine is an agonist or an antagonist from this experiment? 2. Both tubocurarine and atropine are antagonists of ACh receptors. Why is only tubocurarine effective in the present experiment? Atropine (M) Tension (g) Average Tension (g) Inhibition (%) 0 1x10 -7 1x10 -6 1x10 -5 1x10 -4 1x10 -3 Direct Muscle Stimulation 69 3. Would you expect atropine to be able to inhibit carbachol-induced contraction of gastrointestinal smooth muscle? Why is this? Experiment 3 The effect of neostigmine on neurally-induced skeletal muscle contraction Neostigmine is an acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor. It is able to bind to AChE and thereby inhibits the enzymes ability to hydrolyse ACh.  From your knowledge of the cholinergic system what do you predict will be the effect of neostigmine on the diaphragm contractile response to phrenic nerve stimulation? • Add neostigmine (2x10-7 M) to the organ bath and monitor the response. Does the effect match your prediction?  What do you notice after washing out the neostigmine from the organ bath? What does this suggest about the effects of the drug on AChE? 70 Questions • A commonly used class of insecticides are the organophosphates which can cause toxic effects in humans and animals. These toxins covalently modify and inactivate AChE. How are the effects of the organophosphates likely to compare to neostigmine in the present experimental model? Experiment 4 Reversal of tubocurarine-induced blockade by neostigmine For this experiment it is best to select a new rat from the file menu. • Again, start nerve stimulation and after a suitable equilibration period add tubocurarine (1x10-6 M). • Allow the inhibition to take maximal effect - do not wash away the drug. • Whilst still in the presence of tubocurarine add neostigmine (2x10-7 M). What do you observe? Questions 1. Describe the mechanism that underlies neostigmine’s ability to reverse tubocurarine blockade of the neuromuscular junction. 71 2. The autoimmune disease myasthenia gravis, which can produce skeletal muscle weakness and paralysis, results from a loss of nicotinic ACh receptors. Do you think that AChE-inhibitors may have a role in therapy of this disease? Describe why you think this is the case? Experiment 5 Effect of neostigmine on suxamethonium-induced neuromuscular blockade For this experiment it is best to select a new rat from the file menu. • Again start nerve stimulation and, after a suitable equilibration period, find a concentration of suxamethonium that produces approximately the same amount of muscle blockade as produced by 1x106 M tubocurarine. NB: This might take a bit of trial and error to achieve… • Allow the inhibition with the selected concentration of suxamethonium to take maximal effect - do not wash away the drug. • Whilst still in the presence of suxamethonium add neostigmine (2x10-7 M).  What do you observe? How does this compare to the effect of neostigmine on tubocurarine- induced blockade?  How does a nicotinic receptor agonist (suxamethonium) produce skeletal muscle relaxation? (you will most likely have to consult a pharmacology textbook, or other trusted online sources, to work this out). 72  Describe why neostigmine has different effects on the muscle relaxation induced by tubocurarine and suxamethonium. (you will most likely have to consult a pharmacology textbook, or other trusted online sources, to work this out). Experiment 6 Identification of ambiguously labelled compounds You have been provided with TWO tubes that have been poorly labelled. One tube contains the potentially deadly tetrodotoxin, which is a Na+ channel blocker. The toxin is produced by a marine bacterium that accumulates in certain tissues of the puffer fish. Besides being VERY dangerous (minimal lethal dose in the mouse 8 µg/kg) this reagent is hard to isolate and is expensive and hence discarding both tubes is not an option. The other tube contains the muscle relaxant drug tubocurarine. YOU DO NOT KNOW THE CONCENTRATIONS OF THESE SUBSTANCES. Using the rat phrenic nerve–hemidiaphragm preparation, what experiments could you conduct in order to identify which tube contains which agent? Use the space below to work out your strategy and then conduct the experiment to see if your strategy is sound. 73 Use this page for your notes and sketches","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
