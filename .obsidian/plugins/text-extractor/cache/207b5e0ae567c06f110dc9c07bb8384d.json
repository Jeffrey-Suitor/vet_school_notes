This in part reflects the fact that ingested toxins are delivered directly to it from the gastrointestinal tract via the portal vein. Some toxins may also be selectively extracted by and concentrated within hepatocytes and/or the biliary system. However, a major reason for the liver’s vulnerability to toxic injury is because of the role that hepatocytes play in biotransformation of endogenous substances and xenobiotics. Hepatic biotransformation is largely performed within the smooth endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes by the mixed function oxidase enzyme system (cytochrome P450 system). The process is largely designed to convert fat-soluble compounds into water-soluble compounds that can be readily excreted from the body via the bile or urine. Hepatic biotransformation reactions may generate intermediate molecules that may be more toxic than the parent compound, thereby injuring or killing hepatocytes. Biotransformation also generates reactive oxygen species (free radicals) that may damage cell and organelle membranes. The most common lesion observed in the liver following acute toxic injury is periacinar (zone 3 or centrilobular) necrosis. The zonal distribution reflects the fact that the highest activity of mixed function oxidase enzymes is found in the zone 3 hepatocytes. Several broad toxicological concepts will be introduced in the first of these lectures. We will define predictable and idiosyncratic toxins, discuss the circumstances that predispose to toxicity, and explain the multiple factors (other than the dose of toxin) that influence the consequences of exposure. Drawing on your knowledge of hepatic diseases, we will also compare and contrast the clinical signs, gross necropsy lesions and hepatic histological lesions that can be anticipated in acute and chronic hepatotoxicity in domestic animals. You will be introduced to a variety of hepatotoxins that commonly cause acute and/or chronic hepatic injury in domestic animals: e.g. blue-green algae, poisonous mushrooms, toxic plants such as lantana, cycads and poison peach, paracetamol, aflatoxins, phomopsins, pyrrolizidine alkaloids, and copper. In the second lecture, you will be provided with an overview of hyperplastic and neoplastic conditions of the liver and biliary tree. Many older dogs develop multifocal nodular hyperplasia of their hepatocytes (idiopathic nodular hyperplasia). Although the nodules grossly and histologically resemble the regenerative nodules seen in chronic hepatopathies and cirrhosis, they are never as numerous and the liver is otherwise essentially normal. Such nodules are commonly aspirated or biopsied to allow distinction from genuine neoplasms. Malignant tumours arising elsewhere in the body commonly metastasise (spread) to the liver. Primary tumours arising in the liver are usually of hepatocellular, cholangiocellular (biliary epithelial) or vascular endothelial origin. We will review the typical gross appearance of these tumour types, their nomenclature, and their expected behaviour in domestic animals. FURTHER READING DL Brown, AJ Van Wettere and JM Cullen.
