Cat – right lateral aspect – thoracic and abdominal wall removed, diaphragm reflected cranially. Position of tract structures Ventral aspect of abdomen female pig – gastrointestinal tract removed and bladder reflected caudally. (Note: in pigs the kidneys are usually described as having no contact with the liver, however in this animal the right kidney is in contact with the liver and has formed a renal impression with the caudate process) Retroperitoneal location Cat abdomen – ventral aspect, the gastrointestinal tract has been removed and the peritoneum incised (black arrows) and reflected from the capsule on the ventral aspect of the r. kidney. Note the ureters are also retroperitoneal as they traverse the dorsal abdominal wall. The kidneys are located outside the peritoneal cavity: Position of tract structures Ventral aspect – caudal abdomen and pelvis in female pig - the pelvic symphysis has been separated to expose the caudal ureter and vestibule urethra vagina ductus deferens prostate gl. penile intrapelvic Structures shared with reproductive tract Images: HMS Davies Annotated: C Murray (Singh) hilum a= renal artery, v =renal vein, u =ureter Male cat - ventral aspect of structures of dorsal cranial abdomen, gastrointestinal tract removed The kidney Sheep kidney – longitudinal midline section (dorsal plane) Cat - L. kidney, capsule incised Cat kidney -the capsule is continuous with the connective tissue on the exterior of the renal pelvis The kidney The ureter expands within the sinus to catch the urine formed by the kidney: • Pelvis – a single funnel shaped expansion of the ureter • Calyx – a cup like expansion - usually at the end of a branch (Plural=calyces) Ureter – pelvis and calyces Pelvis Ureter branches with a calyx at the end of each branch Pelvis with calyces directly on the pelvis or at the end of short branches The renal lobe comprises a cap of cortical tissue & medullary pyramid Renal papilla (P) = apex of the medullary pyramid A renal papilla projects into a renal pelvis or calyx Rodent kidney sections https://reni.item.fraunhofer.de/reni/trimming/manus.php?mno=010 Renal lobe • Blood filtered within cortex • Filtrate modified in cortex and medulla • Filtrate concentrated within medulla • Urine drains from renal papilla into pelvis/calyx Pelvis = single funnel shaped dilation of proximal ureter Calyx = expansion of a branch of the ureter or a branch of the pelvis • The primitive kidney as depicted above has no fusion between adjacent lobes • Most mammalian kidneys are multilobed with varying degrees of fusion between lobes. Renal lobe Classification of domestic mammalian kidneys Unilobar Multilobar - fused cortex Multilobar - Lobation apparent on the surface Multilobar - fused cortex & medulla • Rodent • Rabbit • Ox • Pig • Dog, sheep • Horse, cat Unilobar kidneys – rodents, rabbit Unipyramidal medulla Cortex (c) Medulla/medullary pyramid (m) Renal papilla (pa) C m Pelvis (p) Ureter (u) p u pa p Multilobar – lobes distinct ox Ox – left kidney. The perirenal fat and renal capsule have been removed (Budras) Multilobar – lobes distinct ox The kidneys in situ in the ox – note that the gastrointestinal tract has been removed – the left kidney would normally be pushed to the right of midline by the rumen A=ureter, b =calyx, c=principal/1° branch, d= terminal/2° branch (Sisson) Multilobar – lobes distinct ox Ox – preserved right kidney: tissue removed at one end to expose the renal sinus and branches of ureter. A blue latex cast has been made of the branches of the ureter and calyces. Multilobar cortical fusion only - pig The pig kidney is an elongated bean shape with a smooth surface due to a fused cortex. Internally the medullary pyramids are distinct Cast of pelvis and calyces Multilobar – cortical and medullary fusion (crest type) Sheep kidney – sectioned in midline longitudinally. The black arrows indicate the renal crest Multilobar – crest type: dog and sheep Dog abdomen – left lateral aspect Sheep kidney Capsule and perirenal fat removed Dog and sheep kidney similar appearance and structure. Differences: • Colour • Quality (and quantity) of perirenal fat • Sheep: both kidneys located on RHS of abdominal cavity • Stellate vv may be more visible in dog Multilobar – crest type: dog and sheep Kidneys sectioned in the longitudinal (dorsal) and transverse planes – the top two kidneys are thawed kidneys from a dog. The lower 3 sections are preserved specimens from a sheep Cast of sheep renal pelvis – lateral aspect Cast of dog renal pelvis – dorsal aspect Multilobar – crest type: cat 2. Kidneys from two different cats, the left is the kidney in image 1. sectioned along the longitudinal midline, blue arrow=renal crest 1. Cat left kidney capsule opened The cat kidney is a rounder bean shape than the dog kidney and a yellowish red colour. It is distinguished by the prominent capsular veins on it surface that drain directly to the renal vein. Multilobar – crest type: horse Right and left kidneys of horse – dorsal aspect (Sisson) Multilobar – crest type: horse Horse, right kidney, sectioned in longitudinal midline (dorsal plane) Black arrows= renal crest Latex cast – horse renal pelvis.

The horse renal pelvis and proximal ureter has mucous glands in the submucosa – compare the inner surface to that of the renal pelvis in the sheep kidney. Horse urine has a mucoid appearance and with agitation becomes frothy. Note the yellow fat filling the renal sinus. Sheep kidney Ureter Pig – female, bladder reflected caudally. In the female the ureter passes through the broad ligament of the uterus as it descends towards the dorsal aspect of the caudal bladder. It then passes between the serosal layers of the lateral ligament before entering the bladder • Thick walled muscular tube that propels urine via peristalsis • Three smooth muscle layers are distinct • Transitional epithelium • Usually embedded in fat • Retroperitoneal until it descends towards the bladder via ligaments Ureter Oblique entry through dorsal bladder wall Pig: bladder and proximal urethra opened via ventral wall. Probe inserted into ureteric orifice to show the mucosal flap valve formed by the oblique entry through the bladder wall (Singh) Bladder • Transitional epithelium • Tunica muscularis= ‘detrusor muscle’ - Smooth muscle: 3 layers not distinct • Serosa (visceral peritoneum) - on surface of apex and most of body Interior of dorsal wall of bladder. The base of the Trigone (blue dotted line) is the line between the two ureteric orifices the apex is where the mucosal folds meet at the urethral crest (Konig) (Evans) Bladder Cat bladder (reflected caudally)- empty Wall is thick, opaque and has folds Pig bladder - filling Wall is smooth, thinner and more transparent Bladder - ligaments Cat – median ligament • from bladder wall to linea alba as far cranially as umbilicus. • a vestige of the urachus may be observed on the apex of the bladder and along the cranial margin of the median ligament Pig – lateral ligaments Urethra • Transitional epithelium becomes stratified squamous epithelium at terminal end • Lamina propria/submucosa: Cavernous tissue - blood filled channels = Corpus spongiosum surrounds urethra - significantly expanded in penis • Tunica muscularis: smooth muscle through length of urethra with skeletal muscle – the urethralis muscle surrounding the smooth muscle of the intrapelvic urethra urethra vagina ductus deferens prostate gl. penile intrapelvic A muscular tube extending from the bladder neck to the external urethral orifice. Shared portions of the urinary and reproductive systems: Images: HMS Davies (Aughey) Urethra - female Pig – ventral aspect Pig – urinary and genital tracts. Dorsal wall of vestibule and vagina opened to show external urethral orifice in the cranial vestibule, just caudal to the vagina (Singh) Urethra – suburethral diverticulum Suburethral diverticulum In the cow and sow, the urethra opens into the roof of a small diverticulum (pouch) in the floor of the vestibule (Singh) Urethra - male Pelvic part: Ductus deferens and ducts of accessory glands (e.g. prostate) open here. Intrapenile part: Corpus spongiosum that surrounds urethra significantly expanded – is part of the cavernous tissues that contribute to erectile function The os penis is a bone in the penis of the cat and dog. In the dog partly encloses the urethra within the urethral groove. (Evans) (Aughey)","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
