For each of the following structural hormone groups 1. Peptides (eg insulin), 2. Catecholamine (eg adrenalin) 3. Thyroid hormones (eg thyroxine) 4. Eicosanoids (eg prostaglandin) and 5. Steroids eg cortisol • Describe: • How and where the hormone is produced • The hormone’s main biological function(s) • How the hormone’s secretion is regulated 2. Describe using specific hormone examples, how negative and positive feedback process work. 3. Explain using examples, how certain diseases can interfere with the production or effect of a hormone Slide 2Slide 3 Chemical classes of hormones • 1) Peptides: chains of specific amino acids • Hypothalamus, pituitary, pancreas, parathyroid gland, kidneys, liver, heart, & GI tract. • Insulin, vasopressin, TSH, calcitonin etc • 2) Amines: Tyrosine derivatives • a) Catecholamines (Adrenal Medulla) • Adrenalin & noradrenalin • b) Thyroid hormones • Thyroxine & triiodothyronine • 3) Steroids: Cholesterol derivatives • Adrenal cortex, gonads & placental hormones • Cortisol, aldosterone, oestrogen, testosterone etc • 4) Eicosanoids: Arachidonic acid derivatives. Usually act as autocrine or paracrine signalling molecules, but can act distally • There are four families of eicosanoids—the prostaglandins, prostacyclins, the thromboxanes and the leukotrienes Hormone Receptor Signal transduction Cascade Response Slide 4 Protein or peptide hormones 1. Hormone formation • Preprohormones (rough endoplasmic reticulum) – ––––> prohormones ––––> active hormones • Golgi complex concentrates the finished hormones and they are stored in secretory vesicles. • Appropriate stimulus usually Ca2+ results in exocytosis. 1. Peptides (hydrophilic) are transported as free hormone dissolved in the plasma. 2. Bind to specific cell surface receptor on target cell • Activates second messenger ---> cascade effect Prohormone cleavage – insulin Proinsulin is cleaved to form the connecting peptide (C peptide) and insulin ( and  chains) Packaged in secretory granules Guyton & Hall, 2011 Slide 5 Peptide Hormones Solubility: Hydrophilic (polar) Synthesis: Rough ER, Packaged in Golgi complex Storage: Secretory granules Secretion: Exocytosis Transport: Free hormone: soluble Receptor site: Surface of target cell Action: Ion channel changes or Second messenger system Slide 6 Insulin • Anabolic hormone produced in the pancreatic  cells in times of excess nutrient availability • Allows the body to use carbohydrates as energy sources and store nutrients • Targets • Liver, muscle, adipose tissue • Functions • Lowers blood glucose levels • Increases facilitated diffusion of glucose into cells • Increases conversion of glucose into glycogen (glycogenesis) • Increases uptake of amino acids and protein synthesis • Increases synthesis of fatty acids (lipogenesis) • Slows glycogenolysis • Slows gluconeogenesis • Insulin receptor • Example of enzyme-linked receptor (tyrosine kinase) • Tyrosine phosphorylation triggers multiple pathways Guyton & Hall, 2011 Insulin receptor Slide 7 Regulation of insulin secretion • Glucose is most important regulator of insulin secretion • Factors controlling insulin secretion • - cells monitor levels of circulating metabolites • Glucose • Leucine & alanine • Amino acids have little effect in absence of glucose increase, but they double insulin release in combination with glucose • Neuronal & hormonal • Parasympathetic stimulation • CCK (cholecystokinin) • Gastric hormones stimulate an ‘Anticipatory’ release of insulin • Other hormones, eg glucagon, growth hormone, cortisol Source : Marieb, 2012 Slide 8 Regulation of catecholamines • Stress is the major stimulation of adrenalin or epinephrine release • Threat, noise, excitement, high temperature • The catecholamines are synthesised in sequence from tyrosine • No negative feedback loop. Action is stopped mainly by degradation as hormones have a short ½ life Berne and Levy Principles of physiology 1996 Slide 9 Amine Hormones: Catecholamines (dopamine, adrenaline and noradrenaline) Structure: Tyrosine Derivative Solubility: Hydrophilic Synthesis: Cytosol Storage: Secretory (Chromaffin) Granules Secretion: Exocytosis Transport: As a Free Hormone and Bound to Plasma Proteins Receptor site: Surface of Target Cell Action: Second Messenger System • Derived from tyrosine • Catecholamines – synthesized in adrenal gland and stored in preformed vesicles • [Thyroid hormones – special case and covered separately] Tyrosine Slide 10 Amine Hormones: Catecholamines (dopamine, adrenaline and noradrenaline) • Adrenaline (Epinephrine) • Produced in adrenal medulla following sympathetic stimulation • Response depends on the receptor in the target tissue www.medic101.com-EMP_Lessons-Endocrinology-epinephrine_structure.jpg.jpghttp://13545233.test.prositehosting.co.uk/hcp/MOA.html Slide 11 Amine hormones: Thyroid hormones • Lipophilic amines, but polarity of the iodine means active transport is required across cell membranes • Produced in thyroid • Regulate basal metabolic rate • Stored as thyroglobulin in colloid follicles • Cleaved to form pro-hormone Thyroxine (T4) & active Triiodothyronine (T3) Boron & Boulpaep 2nd ed 2012 Slide 12 Thyroid hormones – tyrosine-derived • Thyroxine (T4) & Triiodothyronine (T3) • Iodinated forms of tyrosine derivatives.

Promotes milk ejection (milk let down) during lactation • Milk initially secreted into alveoli (sacs) within mammary gland • OCT stimulates contraction of myoepithelial cells (smooth muscle cells) which surround alveoli 2. Uterine contraction during parturition • Important in cervical dilation & uterine contractions • After birth maintains haemostasis & evacuation of placenta Slide 24 Positive Regulation of Oxytocin Secretion 1. Suckling • Neurogenic reflex to hypothalamus 2. Pregnancy and Parturition • Oxytocin receptors in uterus increase late trimester & during labour • Estrogen induced • Uterus stretching - --> more oxytocin released Slide 25 www.ansi.okstate.edu-course-3443-study-Notes-endocrin-oxytocin.jpg. Basis of endocrine disorders leading to disease • Increased or reduced hormone activity: • Tumours • Hyperthyroidism due to thyroid tumour – increased T3 & T4 • Increased cortisol due to benign pituitary tumour – Cushing’s disease • Immunological causes • Grave’s disease – autoimmune hyperthyroidism • Type I diabetes – autoimmune destruction of pancreatic islet cells • Genetic disorder (absence of enzyme) • Dietary deficiency • Hypothyroidism due to insufficient iodine • Increased removal from the blood or transport deficiencies • Liver disease – reduced plasma protein binding • Transduction failure – adequate hormone, but target cells don’t respond • Receptor deficiency or disorders of signalling pathway - transduction Slide 26 Diabetes Mellitus : clinical correlations from Cunningham Veterinary Physiology History • You are presented with a 10- year-old, intact, female poodle whose owner is upset because the dog urinates in the house. • In addition, the owner has noticed that the animal drinks larger amounts of water than it has in the past. • Although the owner indicates the dog has a good appetite, it appears to have lost weight over the past few months. Clinical examination • You are able to run a blood glucose determination in your hospital and tell the owner that the glucose concentration is 14.9 mmol/L • During the examination you check the dog’s breath and detect a sweet odour. • Among the organ systems you check are the eyes, and you find developing cataract formation. • Because you have seen this dog many times before, you check its weight and find that it has lost 1 kg since its last admittance a year ago.
