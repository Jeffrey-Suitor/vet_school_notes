Mesoduodenum 2. Hepatoduodenal ligament 3. Duodenocolic fold Duodenum – internal features • Pyloric opening • Major duodenal papilla • Minor duodenal papilla • Mucosal folds covered in numerous microscopic villi • Brunner’s glands → mucus Major Minor Pancreas • Body • Two lobes (V-shape, unite caudomedial to pylorus) • Left lobe: shorter & thicker • Associated with caudal surface of the stomach; within the greater omentum • Right lobe: long & slender • Runs within the mesoduodenum Pancreas • External features: • Body & two lobes • Yellowish-pink in colour • Coarsely lobulated and forms a nodular surface Pancreas • Pancreatic Duct • Drains ventral primordium • Opens on major duodenal papilla • In conjunction with bile duct • Accessory Pancreatic Duct • Drains dorsal primordium • Opens on minor duodenal papilla • 3-5 cm distal Cat – duodenum and pancreas • Duodenum • ~10cm long • (Total small intestine length: 1-1.2m) • Pancreas • Only one duodenal papilla • Only one pancreatic duct Jejunum & ileum • Forms the bulk of small intestine • Occupies the ventral part of abdomen – between stomach and bladder • May be exteriorised Jejunum & ileum – external features • Jejunum • Most convoluted part of s.i. • Long mesentery • Ileum • Straight and usually contracted (firmer) • Additional (antimesenteric) blood vessel and ileocaecal fold • Ends at the ileocolic junction Jejunum & ileum – connecting peritoneum • Great mesentery (long mesentery) • Connecting peritoneum (two layers) • Vessels and nerves between layers • Gathered at its root at the origin of the cranial mesenteric artery • (Intestinal mass covered ventrally by greater omentum) Descending duodenum Parietal peritoneum (dashed line) R. kidney Aorta Jejunum Spleen L. kidney Root of mesentery Visceral peritoneum (continuous line) (Dyce, Sack and Wensing, p118) Vertebrae Connecting peritoneum (mesentery) Omentum Greater omentum Cranial Caudal Jejunum & ileum – internal features • Velvety appearance – villi • Longitudinal and spiral folds • Peyer’s patches • Ileocolic orifice/ - sphincter Small intestine – internal features • Surface area ↑↑↑ • Gross folds • Villi • Microvilli: “Brush borders” Ileocolic junctionLarge intestine • Consists of four segments: • Caecum • Colon • Rectum • Anal canal Caecum – external features • Located in right dorsal region of abdominal cavity • Ileocaecal fold • Blind ending • Spiral-shaped in dogs Caecum – internal features • Opens into ascending colon via caecocolic orifice • Guarded by muscular ring – caecocolic sphincter Cat – caecumColon – external features • Three parts: • Ascending colon • Transverse colon • Descending colon • Connecting peritoneum: • Mesocolon • Duodenocolic fold Large intestine - schematic Ileum Caecum Ascending colon Transverse colon Aorta Descending colon Rectum Blood supply to the intestines • Celiac artery • Hepatic branch to proximal duodenum • Cranial mesenteric artery • Small intestine, caecum and most of colon • Caudal mesenteric artery • Descending colon, cranial rectum • Internal pudendal artery • Caudal rectum and anus 1 – Aorta 2 – Celiac a. 4 – Hepatic a. 7 – Gastroduodenal a. 9 – Cranial pancreatico- duodenal a.
