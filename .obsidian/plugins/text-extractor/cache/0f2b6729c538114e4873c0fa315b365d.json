The teaching staff will then demonstrate the activities below, after which you will have the chance to practice them: • Use of the crush (without a cow in it initially) • Approaching the cow in the crush: o From the side to palpate the paralumbar fossa and over the ribs where you might hear the heart with a stethoscope o From behind (+/- take their temperature) • Putting a halter on a cow in a crush and removing it safely • Moving a small group cows from one yard to another Preparation: You should recognise the first two points below from the cattle and sheep handling CLA you have done but its given again here in case you need a refresher! 1.
