Students should be aware that the practical classes in this course have been approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the University of Melbourne and that these classes are an essential part of the course – an exemption from this component is not possible. ETHICAL GUIDELINES INVOLVING THE USE OF ANIMALS / ANIMAL TISSUES * Using animals or their tissues in laboratory classes is a privilege which brings with it responsibilities that go well beyond the need to avoid cruelty to the animals. Outlined below is some advice which will help you meet these responsibilities and will help you to derive maximum benefit from using animals in laboratory classes. Following this advice will show that you are aware of and accept the responsibilities that accompany the use of animals or their tissues for learning. Think about the use of animals or their tissues. Talk about this with other students and staff. Everybody should develop their own opinions about this topic and be prepared to air them, justify them, and modify them. Also, you should feel free to make suggestions which might improve future laboratory classes. Make sure that good use is made of the learning opportunity. Be well prepared. This involves reading background material from lecture notes and references before coming to class, reading the laboratory manual before the class, and being generally prepared to maximise the learning experience. Think actively during the class. You should know what underlying principles are being taught in the class and understand the details which illustrate those principles. This is best achieved by active involvement rather than by merely waiting to be taught. Participation in the class should be active also. You should use every opportunity, within the approved scope of the class, to develop manual, observational and recording skills. Think beyond the immediate scope of the class. Seeking to link the new knowledge and understanding gained in each class with other parts of the course is a learning device that will help you consolidate your knowledge. Treat animals and their tissues with respect at all times and take particular care to treat live animals humanely. *These guidelines were written by Professor David Mellor, Faculty of Veterinary Science, Massey University 2 G E N E R A L I N S T R U C T I O N S F O R P R A C T I C A L C L A S S E S I N T H E W E B S D I S S E C T I O N L A B O R A T O R Y Dissection Lab manager: Dr James Adamu james.adamu@unimelb.edu.au Students are expected to approach the dissection classes with a mature attitude and be adequately prepared to carry out the dissections efficiently and effectively. The guidelines set down below should assist with this. • Students are expected to prepare for each class beforehand by reviewing the relevant sections of recommended texts and by revising relevant lecture notes. • For dissections (e.g. dog abdomen), the dissection tables in the laboratory are allocated to students in groups. Student groups will be posted in the room and on the LMS. Where otherwise notified, demonstration wetlabs may involve larger groups of up to 15 students rotating around various stations. • Dissections should be carried out carefully and thoroughly. These classes are intended to help you consolidate and expand on the information given in the lecture course - use this time wisely. These classes will also help you develop dexterity in dissection and instrument handling. • The dissection laboratory might on occasion be available outside scheduled class times for students that wish to revise material.1 Contact James Adamu to request extra dissection material; groups of 3-6 students should be assembled. It is required that during all dissection classes students DO the following: • Follow all temporal COVID Safe measures, including wearing of a well-fitted disposable face mask. • Wear laboratory coats with your name clearly displayed. • Wear shoes which cover the upper surface of the foot and that are made of leather or similar, or if canvas have shoelaces, to provide protection from falling sharps. Canvas slip-on shoes do not provide sufficient protection. • Wear gloves. Every endeavour is made to ensure that fresh specimens are free from disease, but this may not always be the case. Gloves are provided for your protection and must be worn. • Tablets such as iPads may be used in the dissection lab but must be covered with the clear plastic film provided before they can be used in class. This film must be discarded at the end of the class. • Take due care when using sharp instruments for dissection. • Scalpel blades will be provided. Dispose of used/broken sharps in the correct receptacles. • Dispose of unwanted tissues in the buckets under the tables or in bins as indicated during the classes. • Buckets containing discarded tissues should be emptied into bins at the end of each practical session. • Replace stools under tables after each class and clean the tables (sponges and paper towels are available at the sinks). • Report any personal injuries to a staff member in attendance. Unfortunately, there are some DONT’S: • Don’t eat or drink in the laboratory. • Photography or video or audio recording is not permitted in the dissection lab at any time. • Don’t bring library books into the laboratory, limited copies of texts are available in the laboratory. If you have to refer to library texts then these should be left in the Object Based Learning Area (OBLA) for use during the classes. • The textbooks that have been provided are for use within the dissection lab and are not to be taken out of the lab. Gloves must be removed and hands clean when using these textbooks. • Don’t remove animal tissues from the laboratory; tissues must be disposed of by staff for reasons of health and safety. • Care must be exercised at all times when in the dissection laboratory for your own and others safety. Inappropriate (unsafe) behaviour will not be tolerated. • Visitors are not permitted in the dissection laboratory or OBLA. • Compliance with the above would be appreciated; failure to do so may lead to a demand to leave the class. 1 Outside of scheduled class times, veterinary students might be able to access the WEBS Dissection lab upon request between the hours of 8.30am and 5.30pm. However, students must have permission to enter the preparatory areas adjacent to the lab. Permission is also required to enter the cold room and to open the formalin tanks. 3 G E N E R A L I N S T R U C T I O N S F O R P R A C T I C A L C L A S S E S I N A N A T O M I C P A T H O L O G Y Practical classes conducted in anatomic pathology will be held at the Werribee campus in the Dissection and Pathology Laboratory (Room 410) on Level 4 of the Learning and Teaching Building. A map of the Werribee campus is included (see next page). These classes provide the opportunity to view and manipulate a collection of fixed (preserved) wet specimens that illustrate naturally occurring diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, exocrine pancreas and peritoneal cavity of a range of domestic animals. During discussion of the specimens, you will be asked to describe what gross abnormalities you can see and/or feel and to apply the knowledge that you have gleaned from the relevant lectures to speculate as to the possible disease processes involved, their causes and potential consequences. Students will also have the opportunity to view a number of Question and Answer cards that explore the gross (macroscopic) and histological (microscopic) features of common lesions. For these classes, the following instructions apply: • Follow all temporal COVID Safe measures, including wearing of a well-fitted disposable face mask. • Students are expected to wear appropriate clothing – fully enclosed, waterproof shoes and a clean laboratory coat. Gloves and laboratory coats will be provided. • No food or drink is allowed in the Dissection and Pathology Laboratory. • Bags should not be brought into the Dissection and Pathology Laboratory or up to Level 4 of the Learning and Teaching Building. Student lockers are available on the ground floor of the LTB near the change rooms, if you wish to secure your belongings. These lockers are for temporary storage of items on Thursdays at Werribee only and students must provide their own locks. • There is no need to bring notepads or writing implements into the Dissection and Pathology Laboratory. All information discussed during these classes will be available in lecture notes, Question and Answer sheets and PowerPoint presentations via the subject LMS website. • At the end of each wet specimen class, students are expected to dispose of their gloves in the appropriate bins, wash their hands thoroughly with antiseptics, and immerse their shoes in the disinfectant footbaths provided. Laboratory coats must be removed prior to exit from the Dissection and Pathology Laboratory and discarded in the laundry collection baskets provided. • Please note that some of the preserved wet specimens may emit formalin fumes. If any student feels that he or she is affected adversely by these fumes, please alert an attending staff member. 4 Werribee Campus Map (https://maps.unimelb.edu.au/werribee/building) 5 Veterinary Bioscience: Digestive System O H S I N D U C T I O N & S A F E I N S T R U M E N T H A N D L I N G TEACHING STAFF - Dr James Adamu james.adamu@unimelb.edu.au - Dr Christina Murray cmmurray@unimelb.edu.au - Prof. Simon Bailey bais@unimelb.edu.au - Dr Nicholas Bamford n.bamford@unimelb.edu.au LOCATION - WEBS (Building 125) Dissection Laboratory (Room B104) I N T E N D E D L E A R N I N G O U T C O M E S At the end of this class, you should be able to: - Explain the safety and biosecurity rules and standard working procedures for: o Anatomy Dissection Laboratory o Object Based Learning Area (OBLA) - Demonstrate competency with safe procedures for the normal handling of sharp instruments. C L A S S P R E P A R A T I O N Before attending class: - Read the Dissection Lab Induction and Dissection Lab Standard Working Procedures documents. - Watch short videos (available on the LMS) that demonstrate basic dissection instrument handling and techniques that should be practiced during dissection classes. S A F E I N S T R U M E N T H A N D L I N G ** This exercise must be completed by every student before the first dissection class ** Dissection is your introduction to surgery and the handling of surgical instruments. Scalpels and needles are sharp and it is easy to injure yourself with them. Hence, the development of good habits in handling sharp instruments are essential to avoid injury to yourself or others. The following notes describe the procedure for this class. 6 Following the Dissection Laboratory induction, each student is to locate an instructor at one of the tables and observe the instructor’s demonstration of the following: - Scalpel blade attachment to handle and subsequent removal and disposal of blade. - Hypodermic needle attachment to syringe barrel; subsequent removal and placement in foam block. Students will then: - Practise the above procedures until confident. - Demonstrate their competency in these procedures to their instructor. - Sign their instructor’s record sheet in view of the instructor who will then countersign. - Observe the cannulas and needles on display to confirm their ability to distinguish these items. Instrument grips Two basic grips for holding the scalpel: Disposable scalpel blades For application to, and removal from the scalpel handle, blades are grasped and manipulated with tissue or artery forceps or other grasping instrument rather than with the operator’s gloved hands. There are scalpel blade removal containers available on each dissection table in the dissection laboratory. These containers should be used to remove scalpel blades during classes. Pencil grip The pencil grip facilitates steady cutting by allowing the hand to rest on the tissues and uses finger rather than arm movement to incise; best suited for short, precise incisions. Fingertip grip The fingertip grip is recommended for longer incisions (>3 cm) and uses arm motion rather than finger motion to cut tissue. It is applicable to most scalpel cutting. The index finger is placed on the upper edge of the blade for stability, but should neither touch the tissue being incised, nor obstruct the view of the incision. 7 Using the scalpel Slide cutting is the safest and most common method of incising tissues with a scalpel. The pencil grip is used for short incisions through the delicate tissues, while the fingertip grip is preferred for long incisions and for tissues requiring greater incisional pressure. The increased safety of slide cutting is attributable to application of pressure at a right angle to the motion of the blade. This facilitates precise control of incisional depth as the blade is drawn through the tissue. Arrows indicate directions in which forces are applied. Scissors Efficient scissor cutting depends on closing, shearing and torque forces and the wide-based tripod grip (above) best uses the scissors design to maximise these forces. In this grip the tips of the right thumb and third finger are placed through the rings to grasp the scissors and the right index finger is placed on the shanks near the fulcrum for support. Tissue forceps Tissue forceps are used to stabilise tissues for incision and to retract tissue for exposure or excision – use an instrument to manipulate tissues rather than your fingers, especially if they would be placed in the plane of the incision. These non-locking instruments have grasping surfaces with or without teeth. Tissue forceps are usually held in the non-dominant hand and, when in use, are grasped with a pencil grip. 8 Veterinary Bioscience: Digestive System P R A C T I C A L 1 S K E L E T O N O F T H E H E A D A N D N E C K TEACHING STAFF - Dr Janine Hofmann hofmann.j@unimelb.edu.au - Dr Christina Murray - Dr Reza Sanaei - Dr Nicholas Bamford LOCATION - WEBS (Building 125) Dry Lab (Room 127/128) I N T E N D E D L E A R N I N G O U T C O M E S At the end of this class, you should be able to: - Demonstrate competence in following anatomical descriptions. - Identify the normal appearance of bony features of the upper neck associated with swallowing and prehension including the skull, atlas, axis, and hyoid apparatus. - Apply skills in observation and deduction to identify and name the bones from different species. - Apply appropriate descriptive names for major bone features such as crests, tuberosities, processes, fossae, and foramina. M A T E R I A L S Available in the Dry Lab: - Bone boxes of the head and neck of the dog - Mounted skeleton of the dog Available through the LMS: - Colour-coded skull images from Miller and Evans’ Anatomy of the Dog - Radiographs from Atlas of Normal Radiographic Anatomy and Anatomical Variants - Movie of a rotating skull, which shows all skull bones and their relative positions - Two computer interactive modules: o Navigating the canine head and neck skeleton o Radiology of the canine head and neck 9 Available in the OBLA: - Skulls from domestic species - some sectioned, some painted in coded colours - Mandibles - Dog articulated hyoids - Mounted skeletons - pony skeleton includes the hyoid apparatus P R O C E D U R E All the answers to the questions in this practical class may be found in the lecture notes, these notes, the computer slides, the references, or may be deduced from careful observation. Many of the questions will not have a single “correct” answer. They are to encourage you to practice answering questions using logic, observation, deduction, and your own knowledge as this is a critical skill in veterinary practice. This practical class is divided into two sections. This does not reflect any required sequence and the sections can be worked through in any order that is convenient. Many of the subsections can be completed before the main class, however, the dog bone boxes will only be available during class. Section 1.

It is an interactive platform where you can explore anatomy in 3 dimensions. You can rotate specimens, label specific structures, and focus on identifying features on anatomic and diagnostic images. There is also a quiz mode with labels removed to test your understanding. We recommend this program to support your learning in anatomy and it is also recommended by the diagnostic imaging team for your studies in future years. 10 1 . T H E S K E L E T O N O F T H E H E A D A N D N E C K O F T H E D O G The skeleton of the head and neck includes the skull, mandibles, hyoid apparatus, larynx and seven cervical vertebrae. These structures are the framework that protect and support the soft tissues of the head and neck and give the head its basic shape. They also provide surfaces for muscle attachment and landmarks that are used to determine the position of other structures. SKULL AND MANDIBLES The skull and mandibles (the jaw bones) form the major contours of the head. This means that you can tell the approximate shape of the dog's head in life from its skull and mandibles. Fit the skull and mandibles together in the correct position, using the reference material to help you. The junction of two or more bones in the skeleton is known in anatomy as a joint or articulation. Try to produce the same movements in the joint between the skull and mandibles as shown in the ‘Movements’ page of the ‘Navigating the canine head and neck skeleton’ section of ‘The Canine Head and Neck Skeleton’ learning module on Canvas. What do you think the purpose of these movements might be? ….………………………………………………… Do you expect any other movements are possible between the skull and mandibles in a live dog? …………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………… In a live dog, this joint - temporomandibular joint or TMJ - contains a small plate of fibrocartilage (a tough and springy material) between the bone surfaces, called a meniscus. What effect might this meniscus have on the movements of the TMJ? …………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………… The skull is made up of many bones joined with a special type of fibrous joint known as a suture. Suture lines appear as wriggly darker lines or sometimes small gaps between bone plates in the adult skull. Examine the suture lines in the prepared skulls. Which bones can you identify as being joined by suture lines? The movie of the skull bones may help you to identify the major bones of the skull. Identify the bones of the skull on the following images: - Frontal - Incisive - Lacrimal - Maxillary - Nasal - Occipital - Palatine - Parietal - Pterygoid - Sphenoid complex (basi & pre sphenoids) - Temporal (squamous, petrosal, and tympanic parts) - Zygomatic Also identify the mandible. 11 12 FEATURES OF THE SKULL AND MANDIBLE The skull contains and protects the brain. The brain is part of the central nervous system and is the control centre for the whole body. The skull has many holes (foramina) through which nerves and blood vessels exit or enter the brain. Look at the sectioned skulls and locate the cavity where the brain lies during life (the cranial cavity). Indicate approximately where the cranial cavity lies under the bones in the skull pictures. The foramen magnum is the large hole at the back (caudal aspect) of the skull that the spinal cord passes through to continue the central nervous system caudally through the body. Find the foramen magnum on the prepared skulls and the skull images. The skull provides protection and support to the major sense organs, including the eye and the ear. Can you visualise where the eyes lie in the skull? This space is called the orbit. In the dog, the top and side (dorsolateral) part of the orbit is completed by a fibrous ligament – this ligament is lost when the skulls are cleaned. Feel around your own orbit to appreciate that, unlike the dog, you have a complete bone ring around your eyes. Note the many holes between the braincase and back of the eye sockets in the cleaned skulls. Why might there be so many holes in this region? ………………………………………………………………… One of these holes is the optic canal which carries the optic nerve. The optic nerve takes signals from the light-receiving retina of the eye to the brain, where the signals are processed into images. The ear comprises of external, middle, and internal parts which are associated with parts of the temporal bone. The external ear is supported by cartilages so is also lost during the preparation of the bones. The internal and middle ear located within the bones of the skull. On the outside of the skull, find the tympanic part of the temporal bone which contains some of the middle ear. Then locate the rounded tympanic bulla. The hole above (dorsal) to the tympanic bulla is the external acoustic meatus. In life, the thin tympanic membrane (ear drum) stretches across the external acoustic meatus, separating the middle ear from the external ear. The internal ear is located within the petrosal part of the temporal bone, an irregular lump of bone not visible from the outside of the skill. The internal ear is important for balance and hearing. Identify the temporal bone from the outside, then look inside a sectioned skulls to locate the petrosal part. Where does the petrosal part of the temporal bone lie in relation to the tympanic bulla and the external acoustic meatus? ……………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………... Locate the tympanic bulla in radiographs of the skull. In a radiograph, the bones appear white because they absorb x-rays and air appears black because they don’t absorb x-rays. Soft tissues are somewhere between black and white depending on their thickness and density. That is, the colour correlates to how much of the x-rays they absorb. Hint: the tympanic bulla is an air-filled bone so it will have a white outline and a black interior on a radiograph. In the sectioned skulls, you can see that there are quite a few air-filled spaces within the bones. You have already identified the tympanic bulla on the radiographs. Next, find the braincase (cranial cavity) – filled with soft tissue, not air, but soft tissue also looks dark on radiographs. What other air-filled spaces can you find? Some of the spaces clearly connect with the outside (look at the sectioned skulls to decide which ones do this), the largest being the nasal cavity. The nasal septum is the thin plate of bone that divides the left and right sides of the nasal cavity into the left and right nasal passages. On the underside (ventrum) of the skull, you can see the caudal holes of the nasal passages. These are the choanae or internal nares. 13 The much thicker bone plate which divides the nasal cavity from the mouth is the hard palate. Why do you think the bone of the hard palate is thicker than the nasal septum? ……………………………………………….. ……………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………... You may be able to distinguish some air-filled spaces alongside the nasal passages in the radiographs. Can you see these in the sectioned skulls? They are the paranasal sinuses. Each paranasal sinus is named according to the bone in which it is found. Identify the frontal and maxillary sinuses in the prepared skulls, then draw their approximate position on the skull pictures. At the back of the nasal cavity, look at the sectioned skull and note the many small holes in the ethmoid bone at the front (rostral extremity) of the braincase which separates it from the nasal cavity. This is the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone where all the tiny olfactory nerves involved in smell pass between the brain and the nasal passages. Try and identify the cribriform plate, the nasal conchae, and the choanae on radiographs. The skull also provides support for the teeth and the muscles that open and close the jaw (muscles of mastication). Look at the radiographs and examine the extent of their roots. Which teeth have the longest roots? …………………………………………………………………………………… Deduce from the shape and fit of the teeth how the different teeth might act. Which ones might a dog use to gnaw or shear apart meat and bone? ……………………………………………… Imagine a dog eating a tough piece of food and try to visualise how the dog might position the food to use these specific teeth (the carnassial teeth). Look at the hollows and projections on the bones around the mouth and see if you can determine where the major muscles of mastication lie. Muscles also provide shape to the body, along with the bones and cartilages. If there is a hollow in a bone in a region that looks filled and rounded in a live dog, then it is likely filled with a large muscle. Can you identify a region like this on the skull? And another on the mandible (masseteric fossa)? Additional activity if you have time: The following is a list of the main features of the skull and mandible of the dog. You may find it helpful to practice using anatomical language to locate these features, some of which were described above. They will not be examined in this subject but will come up in other subjects. General features of the skull: braincase, cranial cavity, face, zygomatic arch, hard palate, teeth, nasal cavity, nasal septum, nasal passages, paranasal sinuses (frontal and maxillary), cribriform plate. Openings and hollows: orbit, optic canal, external acoustic meatus, foramen magnum, temporal fossa, infraorbital canal, mandibular fossa. Prominences: nuchal crest, sagittal crest, zygomatic processes of the frontal and temporal bones, tympanic bullae, occipital condyles. Features of the mandible: body, ramus, masseteric fossa, mandibular foramen, condylar process, temporomandibular joint. 14 THE LARYNX AND HYOID APPARATUS The larynx is a group of cartilages that lies at the back of the mouth and at the top (cranial) end of the windpipe (trachea). You may hear it referred to as the voice box or Adam's apple. The larynx helps to prevent food, drink, or anything other than air entering the trachea. Feel your larynx moving up and forward, then down and back when you swallow. This movement is possible because the larynx is hung from the skull (from a point just caudal to the tympanic bulla each side) via a series of small bones and cartilage called the hyoid apparatus. The hyoid apparatus also supports the base of the tongue. Label the 5 major cartilages of the larynx (3 single cartilages and 1 paired) and the main bones/cartilage of the hyoid apparatus on the following images. Canine larynx and hyoid, lateral aspect (From Hermanson, de Lahunta & Evans. Miller and Evans’ Anatomy of the Dog, 4th edition). Cartilage is shown in blue. Line drawings of canine larynx and hyoid, …………………… aspect. (Drawn by Dr Helen Davies). Bone shown in red, cartilage shown in blue. 15 How many bones are there in the dog's hyoid apparatus? ………………………………………………………….. How many joints are there in the hyoid apparatus? ………………………………………………………………….. All joints can be named by joining together the names of the bones on either side of the joint, with the most proximal or dorsal bone first. For example, the articulation between the temporal bone and the mandibular bone is the temporomandibular joint. By following this convention, work out what the joints in the hyoid apparatus are called and label the diagrams above. The hyoid apparatus is generally lost during the production of mounted skeleton specimens, as are the os penis in the dog, and the os cordis in the ox. It can be seen between the mandibles in the pony skeleton in the museum (photographed below). It is also identifiable in most radiographs of the region. Equine skull, mandible, and hyoid, ………………. aspect (Photo by Dr Helen Davies) What is the function of the hyoid apparatus? …………………………………………………………………………. What signs might you observe if a hyoid bone breaks e.g. the stylohyoid? ………………………………………... ……………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………... What might cause the hyoid to break? ………………………………………………………………………………… 16 THE CERVICAL VERTEBRAE There are seven cervical vertebrae in the neck of the dog, known anatomically as the cervical region of the vertebral column. Vertebrae names are commonly abbreviated using the first letter of the region followed by the numbered from the head moving towards the tail (caudally). Thus, the first cervical vertebra is ‘C1’ and the second cervical vertebrae ‘C2’. These two vertebrae are quite distinctive - they have characteristic shapes sculpted by their function and have names to reflect their specialised function. C1 is specialised to support the head. It is called the atlas because in Greek mythology, Atlas holds up the sky. It has large transverse processes or wings (for muscle attachment) and a large articular surface which articulates with the occipital condyles of the skull. C2 is called axis because C1 and the skull rotate around it. It has a specialised process called the dens which protrudes forwards (cranially) into the base of the spinal canal of C1 and a large spinous process. The joints between the occipital condyles of the skull and atlas allow nodding ‘yes’ movements, while the joint between atlas and axis allows rotation (‘no’ movements). Manipulate your bone specimens and see how these movements might be made without risking damage to the spinal cord that runs through vertebral foramen (the large holes in the vertebrae). The remaining five cervical vertebrae (C3, C4, C5, C6, and C7) look more alike. See if you can fit the vertebrae together, then explore what movements can be made between each vertebral pair. Note how each vertebra fits against the next through protruding articular facets (bony prominences involved in articulation with the neighbouring vertebrae), and how these restrict vertebral movements. Between the bodies of the last 5 cervical vertebrae (and all vertebrae in other regions), there are fibrocartilaginous discs (‘intervertebral discs’) which prevent large movements that could damage the spinal cord but allow small movements and some spine flexibility. Why might there be no intervertebral discs present between C1 and C2, or C1 and the skull? ……………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………... From what you have learned above, identify these structures on the following image: - Skull - Mandibles - Cervical vertebrae: atlas (C1); axis (C2); third and fourth cervical vertebrae (C3 & C4) 17 Look carefully at the prepared bones and the whole skeletons and try to visualise where the external skin of the dog would be. Mark where you would expect the skin surface to lie around the bones. Note where the bones and cartilages are likely to be near the surface and imagine this framework within a live dog. You may find that the radiographs help you with this exercise. Consider how you might relate something that you see on a radiograph to the live dog. Draw the position of the hyoid and larynx in the above image too. 18 2 . C O M P A R A T I V E A S P E C T S O F T H E S K U L L Observe the colour coded skulls of the domestic species. Which one belongs to which animal? Practice naming the major bones. Make yourself a colour key for the painted skulls e.g. which bone is painted yellow on all the skulls? Hints: You may find it helpful to review the “flying skull” movie on the computer. Bones with the same names may have very different proportions in the different species but are in the same relationship to each other and have similar foramina, sinuses, processes, and other structural features. There are a range of skulls available in the OBLA. Label the following skulls with their respective species: 19 Look at the teeth and the regions of attachment for the muscles of mastication in the domestic and non- domestic species. You should be able to deduce the type of movements normally made during chewing from the shape and wear patterns on the teeth and the shape of the TMJ. Visualise how a dog chews compared to a cow. What is the difference between their teeth surfaces? ………………………………………………………………... How do they compare to the non-domestic animal skulls? …………………………………………………………. Based on their teeth, deduce which species are: - herbivores ……………………………………………………………………………………………………….. - carnivores ……………………………………………………………………………………………………….. - less specialized in their diet (omnivores) from their teeth? ………………………………………………… ……………………………………………………………………………………………………………………. Based on these assessments, what sort of diets might the non-domestic animals eat? …………………………. ……………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………... Note the size and shape and position of the braincase, nasal cavity, and paranasal sinuses in the sectioned skulls from different species and visualise their positions on the complete skulls. Identify the maxillary and frontal sinuses on the skull radiographs as well. Using your skull anatomy knowledge, where could a hole be made to drain an infected frontal sinus? ……………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………... Look at where the cheek teeth are in relation to the sinuses, particularly in horses. One cause of an infected sinus is an infected tooth.

C L A S S P R E P A R A T I O N - A suite of video tutorials to demonstrate the techniques used in this class is available on the LMS. Students should review these prior to attending class. - Refresh knowledge of safe instrument handling using the notes and videos available on the LMS. N O T E The first time dissecting a cadaver can be confronting and it is quite normal for some students to initially feel uncomfortable. If you feel faint, or need to take a short break outside during class, please bring this to the attention of a staff member. 30 P R O C E D U R E Each table group will be supplied with a specimen to dissect. Depending on availability, these can be either whole cadavers, or an individual forelimb or hind limb, from either a dog or a cat. The aim of this exercise is to acquaint you with the ‘art’ of dissection, i.e. the careful and considered deconstruction of an anatomical specimen in order to enhance knowledge. You will be required to perform some basic dissection techniques, identify some basic anatomical structures and use some limited anatomical terminology. You should understand the meanings of any of the terms used in this class prior to commencing the activities. You do not have to perform the techniques very well – this is a preliminary activity to acquaint you with animal tissues and the use of instruments. You should not hesitate to perform each of the tasks but you should exercise some care and approach the activities seriously if you are to benefit from subsequent dissection classes. Basic dissection techniques: - Identification - Incision of skin - Sharp dissection - Blunt dissection - Isolation - Transection - Reflection - Retraction Basic anatomical tissues and structures encountered: - Skin - Fascia - Muscle - Tendon - Ligament - Articular cartilage - Artery - Vein - Nerve Basic anatomical terminology: - Proximal - Distal - Medial - Lateral 31 SKIN AND FASCIA During this activity you will disrupt the superficial fascia (a layer of loose fibrous connective tissue that holds the skin to the body) and separated the skin from the deep fascia (a layer of dense fibrous connective tissue that closely binds the muscles and other structures) to expose the underlying structures. Forelimb Identify by palpation the lateral epicondyle of the humerus on the lateral aspect (surface) of the limb just proximal to the elbow joint. Stabilize the skin proximal to this point and incise the skin longitudinally on the lateral aspect of the antebrachium (forearm) with a scalpel to just distal to the carpal (wrist) joint. Separate the skin edges of the incision from the underlying tissues to enable the skin edges to be grasped with forceps. Make transverse incisions at the extremities of the initial incision for approximately 5 cm either side. Retract the skin edges with forceps while you separate the skin from the underlying tissues to the extent of the transverse incisions – use sharp dissection one side and blunt dissection the other, and compare the 2 methods – which is faster? which is less damaging to tissues for learning? Hind limb Identify by palpation the head of the fibula on the lateral aspect of the limb just distal to the stifle (knee) joint. Stabilize the skin proximal to this point and incise the skin longitudinally on the lateral aspect of the crus (lower limb) with a scalpel to just distal to the tarsal (hock / ankle) joint. Separate the skin edges of the incision from the underlying tissues to enable the skin edges to be grasped with forceps. Make transverse incisions at the extremities of the initial incision for approximately 5 cm either side. Retract the skin edges with forceps while you separate the skin from the underlying tissues to the extent of the transverse incisions – use sharp dissection one side and blunt dissection the other, and compare the 2 methods – which is faster? which is less damaging to tissues for learning? MUSCLES AND TENDONS Forelimb / Hind limb Select one of the muscles now visible and isolate it by incising the deep fascia along the entire length of each of its cranial and caudal borders - use a scalpel, scissors or your fingers to disrupt the fascia from completely around this muscle’s belly thus isolating it from the surrounding structures. Examine either end of this muscle and note the tendons that attach it to the bones – the proximal tendon is the tendon of origin, the distal one, the tendon of insertion – if possible give each a tug to appreciate how firmly the muscle is attached to the respective bones. Feel the muscle along its entire length to appreciate its shape and texture – you might consider looking away or closing your eyes while doing this so that you get a greater tactile appreciation of its nature – quite often in your career you will be working blind during examinations and surgery and the ability to identify structures by palpation alone will be of great importance. 32 Insert an instrument, eg a pair of scissors, under the midpoint of this muscle’s belly to elevate it away from the underlying structures. Now transect (cut through) the muscle at this point using a scalpel and cutting down onto the scissors or other instrument – this prevents the underlying structures from being unintentionally damaged. Now reflect the 2 parts of the muscle – one portion will be reflected proximally, the other distally to expose the underlying tissues and structures. Re-examine the tendons of origin and insertion to more fully appreciate the extent of their attachments and the bony features (eg tuberosities) onto which they attach. Tendons are composed of dense fibrous connective tissue (similar to deep fascia) and appear white in colour – the typical appearance of fibrous connective tissue. BONES Forelimb – ulna / radius Hindlimb – tibia / fibula Depending on the muscle you have transacted and reflected, a portion of a major limb bone will be visible - if not feel for the bone beneath the other muscles and disrupt the fascia between these and retract them (pull them aside) to expose the bone. Examine the bone and its surface as much as possible by sight and by palpation (again looking away or closing your eyes). LIGAMENTS AND ARTICULAR CARTILAGE Ligaments of the musculoskeletal system are composed of dense fibrous connective tissue similar to tendons, but ligaments join one structure to another e.g. a bone to a bone at a joint. You will examine the collateral ligament of one of the following joints depending on your specimen – the lateral aspect is suggested but you could use the medial aspect if you wish. Forelimb - collateral ligament of the elbow Hindlimb - collateral ligament of the stifle To expose and examine a collateral ligament on the specimen you have do the following manipulation – repeatedly move two of the major sections of the limb relative to each other (eg brachium and antebrachium if you have a forelimb, thigh and crus if you have a hind limb) to determine the point of rotation of the intervening joint - on either the medial (inside) or lateral (outside) aspect identify the point of rotation of the joint by observing where there appears to be no movement of one section relative to the other - incise the skin longitudinally over this point and dissect away the overlying fascia or muscle to expose the collateral ligament - this will look somewhat like a tendon, a strong white fibrous band, but in this case it will be joining the bones of each section of the limb. Manipulate the limb as before to confirm that this is a collateral ligament and test the stability of the joint. Now transect this ligament and see if there is any difference in the stability of the joint after it is cut. Cut the tissues surrounding the joint sufficiently to enable you to open the joint and expose the articular cartilage covering the articular surfaces of the bones. Note how smooth and slippery the articular cartilage is. How does this cartilage layer facilitate joint function? 33 ARTERIES, VEINS AND NERVES The examination of these structures will be carried out on the medial aspect of the brachium (forelimb) or thigh (hind limb). Can you differentiate between an artery, a vein and a nerve using the following basic criteria? An artery is relatively thick-walled elastic tube of smaller diameter than its accompanying vein A vein is a relatively thin-walled collapsible tube A nerve is a white, solid cord and, if stretched rebounds to take on an undulating or wavy appearance Hint – to determine if a structure is tubular make a small cut in its wall to expose its lumen. Forelimb The major vessels and nerves are concentrated on the medial aspect of the brachium overlying the humerus or just along its caudal border. Identify the humerus by palpation and carefully incise the skin over the medial surface of this bone. Retract the skin edges to expose the vessels and nerves which run longitudinally within the limb within the fascia between the major muscle groups. Disrupt this fascia longitudinally by scraping it using the closed blades of a pair of dissecting scissors, or by using a stab & split action with the scissors - this should preserve the structures and enable their exposure and separation from each other and the adjacent muscles. Now try to identify three nerves, and the major artery and accompanying large vein. Hind limb The major vessels, and a medium-sized nerve, are concentrated on the medial aspect of the thigh overlying the femur or just along its caudal border. Identify the femur by palpation and carefully incise the skin in line with the caudal border of the femur for the length of the thigh. Retract the skin edges to expose the vessels which run longitudinally within the limb within the fascia between the major muscle groups. At the proximal end of the incision disrupt the fascia longitudinally by scraping it using the closed blades of a pair of dissecting scissors, or by using a stab & split action with the scissors - this should preserve the structures and enable their exposure and separation from each other and the adjacent muscles. Now try to identify a large vein and artery and a nerve – the nerve is closely apposed to the cranial surface of the artery which in turn lies cranial to the vein. 34 Veterinary Bioscience: Digestive System P R A C T I C A L 4 S H E E P H E A D D I S S E C T I O N TEACHING STAFF - Dr Christina Murray cmmurray@unimelb.edu.au - Prof. Simon Bailey bais@unimelb.edu.au - Dr Reza Sanaei reza.sanaei@unimelb.edu.au - Dr Janine Hofmann hofmann.j@unimelb.edu.au - Dr Nicholas Bamford n.bamford@unimelb.edu.au LOCATION - WEBS (Building 125) Dissection Laboratory (Room B104) I N T E N D E D L E A R N I N G O U T C O M E S At the end of this class, you should be able to: - Identify the positions of the major salivary glands of the sheep. - Recognise the major anatomical structures of the mouth and oropharynx. - Identify the major gross features of the tongue of different species. C L A S S P R E P A R A T I O N - A video tutorial is available on the LMS. Students should review this prior to attending class. 35 1. S H E E P H E A D D I S S E C T I O N Your table has been provided with one sheep head that has been sectioned along the median plane. Work in two groups, with half a head each. You may find some structures are easier to identify in one section or the other, as a perfect midline cut is difficult to achieve. You will be expected to know the structures that are highlighted in bold type. Dissection: Incise the skin around the nostril and lips, around the eye following the bony orbit and around the base of the ear. Using rat-toothed forceps and a scalpel, carefully remove the skin from the entire head, just leaving behind the skin surrounding the nostril, lips, eye and ear. You should start from one of the cut edges of the head, trying to leave as much subcutaneous tissue intact as you can. Then remove the thin layer of subcutaneous muscle and the layer of fat overlying the deeper tissues (it is difficult to do this cleanly). Begin your identification of structures on the lateral surface of the head. The parotid salivary gland lies mainly caudal to the masseter muscle, extending from the base of the ear dorsally, to the angle of the mandible ventrally. The parotid gland is likely to be incomplete in your abattoir sourced specimen. Note the parotid duct as it passes from the rostral margin of the parotid gland across the ventral aspect of the masseter towards the cheek. The mandibular salivary gland in the sheep is larger than the parotid and lies medial to it and the ramus of the mandible. Its duct runs below the oral mucosa on the floor of the oral cavity, to open at the sublingual caruncle (see later). Note the lymph nodes (mandibular and parotid) that lie close to these salivary glands. The dorsal and ventral buccal salivary glands occupy the cheek, level with the upper and lower cheek teeth – only parts of these glands will be visible at this stage. The buccinator is the muscle that acts to return food from the vestibule (space between the cheek and the teeth) to between the teeth for chewing. It covers the buccal region between the maxilla and mandible, from the angle of the lips to the ramus of the mandible. The muscles of mastication include the masseter, that lies on the lateral surface of the ramus of the mandible, ventral to the zygomatic arch, and the temporalis, that occupies the temporal fossa and lies dorsal and medial to the zygomatic arch and rostral and medial to the pinna of the ear. Now turn to the medial cut surface of your specimen. Identify the following structures: Tongue - The frenulum, body, root, apex and torus. - The papillae – which types can you find? - The intrinsic muscle of the tongue (The medial aspect of some of the extrinsic muscles of the tongue may be observed, but these muscles will be more clearly shown in the dog demonstration dissection). Note the transected basihyoid bone in the muscle of the root of the tongue – this is one of the bones of the hyoid apparatus (individual bones of the hyoid will be covered in the respiratory course and need not be explored here). The extrinsic and intrinsic muscles of the tongue act to move and shape the tongue during prehension, chewing and swallowing of food. The sublingual caruncles in the sheep lie on the floor of the mouth, rostral to the frenulum and caudal to the lower incisors. Which salivary gland ducts open here? 36 Dental pad Buccal papillae Hard palate and soft palate The pharynx - this has three parts: - The oropharynx is the space ventral to the soft palate that extends from the palatoglossal arches to the base of the epiglottis. - The nasophaynx is the space dorsal to the palate that extends from the choanae (internal nostrils) to level with the caudal margin of the soft palate at the palatopharyngeal arches. - The laryngopharynx extends from level with the caudal margin of the soft palate to the entrance to the oesophagus (the pharyngeal muscles that assist with movement of food into the oesophagus will be indicated in the demonstration dog dissection). The larynx lies ventral to the laryngopharynx and entrance to the oesophagus. (The individual components of the larynx will be covered in your respiratory course and their identification, except for the epiglottis, is not required here). Now turn to the ventral aspect of the head. The thin mylohyoideus muscle is the most ventral muscle, with transverse fibres that originate on the medial aspect of the mandible. The thicker straplike muscle dorsal to it is the geniohyoideus. These muscles act to move the hyoid and tongue to facilitate prehension and swallowing. Dissection: Incise the mylohyoideus along its attachment to the mandible. This will expose the digastricus muscle that runs medial to the ramus to insert on the medial and ventral aspects of the body of the mandible. This muscle originates on the occipital bone of the skull and it acts to open the mouth. You will also see the ventral part of the pterygoid muscle attached to the medial surface of the ramus of the mandible, deep to the digastricus. The pterygoid, masseter and temporalis muscles act together to elevate and (in herbivores) rotate the jaw during mastication. Dissection: Make a longitudinal incision through the mylohyoideus, parallel to the mandible, to expose the sublingual salivary gland. You may notice one or more large nerves in this region that innnervate the tongue. 37 38 2 . D O G D E M O N S T R A T I O N D I S S E C T I O N This specimen has been prepared so that you can examine an intact larynx and pharynx in situ. The salivary glands have been reflected or removed, the digastricus muscle excised, the mandibular symphysis separated and tissues attached to the medial surface of the mandible reflected. Identify the mylohyoideus and geniohyoideus muscles. The extrinsic muscles of the tongue that originate on the hyoid and the mandible and insert onto the tongue may be seen in this preparation (it is not necessary to name them individually here - that will be covered in a subsequent course). At its cranial end the oesophagus lies dorsal to the trachea. The pharyngeal muscles are intact in this specimen. Insert a finger into the entrance of the oesophagus by passing your hand over the dorsal aspect of the tongue. Your fingers are now within the pharyngeal muscles that are rostral to the oesophageal entrance. You will also be able to feel some of the delicate bones of the hyoid apparatus on either side of this arch of muscles and the cartilages of the larynx ventrally. 39 3 . C O M P A R A T I V E T O N G U E S A number of tongues from different species will be available for examination. Determine the species from which each tongue was taken. Identify and examine the following features: shape, dorsum, apex, body, frenulum, torus linguae and hyoid bones if present. Identify and examine the papillae in respect to types and distribution in each species. What are their functions? From R. Nickel, A. Schummer and E. Seiferle.

Dyce, Sack & Wensing’s Textbook of Veterinary Anatomy (any edition). 42 P R O C E D U R E Part A: midline coeliotomy This is a common surgical approach to the abdomen, which might be used for removing an intestinal foreign body or for a general exploration of the abdominal organs (exploratory laparotomy). 1. Identify the main surface landmarks of the ventral abdomen: the umbilicus, the xiphoid process, the costal arch and the pubic brim. 2. Incise through the skin from the umbilicus half way to the pubic brim (approximately 10-15cm). 3. Continue through the subcutaneous fat (very little in the greyhound) until the underlying muscle can be seen (rectus abdominis). Identify the white line (thin fascia) separating the muscles (linea alba). 4. Carefully incise through the linea alba, and a very thin transparent membrane, the peritoneum, can be seen. 5. Cut through the peritoneum and into the peritoneal cavity. The first thing observed is the lacy (fatty) membranous tissue of the greater omentum. 6. Move the omentum cranially and observe the underlying intestinal structure Q. Is this small or large intestine – and which part? xiphoid process umbilicus pubic brim costal arch 43 Part B: Abdominal wall The abdominal wall supports and protects the abdominal viscera and provides a strong muscular container that can develop significant levels of pressure to aid in the evacuation of the pelvic canal (defaecation, parturition). These muscles are shown below. The external and internal abdominal oblique muscles have fibres running in opposite directions. The innermost layer is the transverse abdominal muscle. The origins and insertions of these muscles will be considered later in the course, in the musculoskeletal module. Now turn the dog so that it lies on the right side. 7. Extend the incision from the xiphoid process to the pubic brim. 8. Reflect the skin of the flank by making incisions from either end of the opening directly dorsally towards the back muscles (as shown). 44 9. Note: A) the strap-like rectus abdominis muscle, and B) the external abdominal oblique muscle, with its fibres running in a craniodorsal to caudoventral direction: 10. Carefully cut a 5cm square window through the external abdominal oblique (as shown) to view the internal abdominal oblique muscle with its fibres running in the opposite direction. 45 11. Reflect the lateral abdominal body wall by cutting around the edge of the costal arch and just cranial to the pelvis (as shown). 12. Turn the dog onto its back and reflect the right lateral abdominal wall (skin and muscle together) to completely reveal the abdominal contents. 46 Part C: Abdominal contents 13. Firstly, reflect the enlarged spleen to the left side, bringing it out of the abdomen to uncover the stomach and the other cranial abdominal organs. 14. Then note the extent of the greater omentum (fold of peritoneum). Note how much of the ventral aspect of the GI tract is covered by this membrane. Tease apart the two sheets to reveal the omental bursa. 15. Follow the greater omentum to the stomach. This is the greater curvature. 16. Identify the body, fundus and pylorus. Note that the body and fundus of the stomach is on the left, and the pylorus lies on the right of midline. 17. Identify the lesser curvature of the stomach, and the lesser omentum (peritoneum) which connects the stomach to the liver. 18. Incise into the stomach, between the greater and lesser curvatures. Observe the folds of the inner stomach lining. 19. Continue your incision to the pylorus, and observe the muscle thickening at the pyloric sphincter. 20. Identify the first part of the duodenum as it leaves the pylorus. Note the two lobes of the pancreas on the inside of the cranial duodenal flexure. 21. Incise into the first part of the duodenum (10cm or so). Gently wash the contents to reveal the mucosal surface. Observe the greater duodenal papilla and place a blunt probe into the common bile duct. 22. A further 4 - 5cm along the duodenum, you may observe the minor duodenal papilla. Q. What secretions enter the duodenum through this duct? …………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………… Greater omentum 47 23. Follow the descending duodenum as it bends (caudal flexure) around the root of the mesentery. The ascending duodenum then continues as the jejunum. 24. Spread out the loops of jejunum to examine the long mesentery containing blood vessels, nerves and lymphatic vessels. Follow the great mesentery to its root. Q. What blood vessel enters here? ……………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………... 25. Cut into a 5cm section of jejunum. Note the smooth velvety texture of the mucosa. 26. Follow the loops of jejunum until you come to the small spiral caecum – this is the ileo-caeco-colic junction. 27. Incise into this region to observe the ileocolic orifice surrounded by the annular fold. Adjacent to this is the slightly wider caeco-colic orifice. 28. The short ascending colon becomes the transverse colon which passes cranial to the root of the mesentery. Then the descending colon takes a relatively straight course towards the pelvic inlet. 29. Note the short mesentery attaching the descending colon to the dorsal body wall. Also note the caudal mesenteric artery supplying the descending colon and rectum. 30. The descending colon passes dorsally to the neck of the bladder and becomes the rectum within the pelvic cavity. 31. Reflect the intestines and stomach to the left side of the abdomen to reveal the underlying structures. The largest blood vessel visible is the caudal vena cava, bringing blood back to the heart from the hindlimbs and lumbar region. The smaller vessel is the portal vein, draining blood away from the intestines, stomach and pancreas to the liver. 48 Part D: Anus and anal sacs Functional closure of the anal orifice is achieved by a set of muscular rings, which are the internal (smooth muscle) and the external (striated muscle) anal sphincters. Opening of these sphincters facilitates evacuation of the rectum (defaecation) when the internal pressure within the abdomen is increased through contraction of the muscles of the abdominal wall. Either side of the anus are a pair of small sinuses, referred to as the anal sacs, which empty their contents during defaecation. The openings of the anal sacs are located laterally near the inner boundary of the visible cutaneous zone of the anus. The sacs themselves are about the size of a pea and inserted between the internal and external anal sphincters just ventral to their excretory duct openings. The anal sacs are clinically important. Procedure: 32. Palpate the sacs on either side of the anus (ventrolaterally). 33. Identify the openings of the ducts from the anal sacs, which open just by the outside of the anus (4 o’clock and 8 o’clock). Insert a blunt probe into the ducts. 34. Gently express the contents of the anal sacs using thumb and forefinger (use cotton wool to soak up the contents, and stand well back!). 49 Veterinary Bioscience: Digestive System P R A C T I C A L 7 H I S T O L O G Y O F T H E S T O M A C H A N D P A N C R E A S TEACHING STAFF - Dr Christina Marth christina.marth@unimelb.edu.au LOCATION - Online I N T E N D E D L E A R N I N G O U T C O M E S At the end of this class, you should be able to: - Compare and identify glandular and non-glandular stomach regions at the histological level in order to recognise differences in form and function. - Identify gastric pits, glands, parietal and chief cells, and gastric epithelial cells in order to relate them to their respective function. - Recognise the main features of the exocrine units of the pancreas in order to relate it to its function and contrast it from other glands, such as the salivary glands.

STOMACH Small (5-15 litres) relative to size of horse but relatively large in unweaned foal – why? Located on the left side of abdomen within the ribcage. The margo plicatus marks the boundary between the non-glandular (continuous with oesophageal mucosa) and glandular (gastric and pyloric) regions of the gastric mucosa. There is a well developed cardiac sphincter and the oesophagus enters the stomach obliquely – significance? Note: shape, greater and lesser omenta, greater and lesser curvatures, saccus caecus, fundus, body, pylorus (pyloric antrum, pyloric canal, pyloric sphincter), margo plicatus, rugae. Can the stomach be assessed during a clinical examination? 52 SMALL INTESTINE 25 meters in length and unremarkable in appearance.

The ileal papilla comprises smooth muscle and contains a venous plexus. Note: vessels and mesenteries and the ileocaecal fold. LARGE INTESTINE CAECUM The caecum is 1 meter in length, comma shaped with a capacity of 30 litres. The base is located in the right dorsal abdomen partly against the flank and partly under the ribs. The body runs ventrally then cranially along the abdominal wall. The apex is near the xiphoid cartridge. 4 taenia (with haustra between) run most of the length of the caecum. Note: Position in the body, shape, base, body, apex taenia, haustra, termination of ileum (ileocaecal orifice), origin of colon (caecocolic orifice), lymph nodes, greater curvature, lesser curvature. COLON Large colon = ascending + transverse. Small colon = descending.

How do the relative sizes of the different forestomachs differ from the cow? 59 S T A T I O N 3 – P I G The pig is a monogastric omnivore. The porcine gastrointestinal tract is similar in shape and position to that of the dog except for the caecum and ascending colon. The porcine caecum is larger; the ascending colon longer and in the form of a cone comprising two spirals. Identify the following organs of the porcine gastrointestinal tract and label the diagram below: Stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, caecum, ascending colon and descending colon. Also identify the pancreas, the portal vein and the major abdominal arteries if possible. Visualise the organs as if they were in the live animal – elevating the tract by grasping the root of the mesentery and lifting it slightly off the table may assist in this –also refer to the models, diagrams and foetal specimens provided. 60 Identify the following features of the porcine gastrointestinal organs: STOMACH Shape, greater and lesser curvatures, greater and lesser omenta, diverticulum ventriculi (a small pouch protruding caudoventral from the dorsal region of the fundus), body, fundus and pylorus (including the pyloric sphincter and torus pyloricus (a mound of smooth muscle and adipose tissue protruding into the pyloric lumen). Note on the internal surface the non-glandular oesophageal region around the opening of the oesophagus and the cardiac, fundic and pyloric gland regions. Can you distinguish these different regions in this specimen? SMALL INTESTINES DUODENUM Initially passes caudally to the right of the root of the mesentery, length = 60cm. Identify, on the mucosal surface, the major duodenal papilla a few cm distal to the pylorus. The minor duodenal papilla is located a further 9 or 10 cm on but is not always obvious being but a small slit-like opening on the mucosal surface. Its approximate position can be estimated by reference to the pancreatic duct as it leaves the extremity of the right lobe of the pancreas to enter the duodenal wall. Which ducts open at the respective papillae in the pig? PANCREAS Note the colour of this organ and identify the right and left lobes and body with the annulus pancreaticus. Which major abdominal blood vessel passes through this opening? JEJUNUM Similar to that of the dog. Length = 14 – 19 cm. Observe the position of the mesenteric lymph nodes. How do they compare with those of the dog and sheep? ILEUM Short terminal section of small intestine. Is the demarcation between jejunum and ileum macroscopically distinct? If not, can you identify the boundary between the jejunum and the ileum by other means? Observe from the mucosal side the entry of the ileum into the large intestine at the caecocolic junction. Note the ileal papilla with the ileal orifice, ileal sphincter and frenula either side of the papilla. 61 LARGE INTESTINES CAECUM Note the unremarkable transition from caecum to colon at this site. Observe the taeniae (thin muscular bands running longitudinally in the wall) and the haustra (rows of sacculations) between them. How many of each is present in this organ? COLON The ascending colon is formed into a cone; the base is anchored dorsally to the roof of the abdomen while the apex points ventrally and is freely movable within the abdominal cavity. The initial portion of the ascending colon spirals inwards from the base of the cone in a clockwise direction, this part has 2 taeniae and haustra. The distal portion, which has no taeniae and haustra, spirals outwards from the apex in an anti-clockwise direction and back up to the right caudal region of the base of the cone. From here it passes cranially to the right of the root of the mesentery to enter the transverse colon followed by the descending colon. Can you distinguish the 2 portions of the ascending colon within the spiral? The descending colon is similar to that of the dog in appearance and position. 62 S T A T I O N 4 – F O W L The following describes the digestive tract (distal to the oropharynx) of the chicken. Note that there is some variation in the anatomy of the digestive tract between avian species, chiefly as a result of adaptation to different diets. These variations are mainly of the form, size or development of the crop, stomach or caeca. OESOPHAGUS The oesophagus is divided from the oropharynx by a row of papillae caudal to the laryngeal mound. It initially lies dorsal to the trachea but then runs down the neck on the right side of it. Cranial to the sternum the oesophagus expands to form the crop. Q. What is the function of the crop? The oesophagus continues into the body cavity where it passes dorsal to the tracheal bifurcation and heart to enter the stomach dorsal to the liver. STOMACH The stomach has two parts: The spindle shaped proventriculus is the glandular stomach that secretes HCl, mucus and pepsinogen. It opens into the gizzard via a constriction called the isthmus. The gizzard (ventriculus) has a thick muscular wall with a thick lining of a protein-carbohydrate complex called koilin. Note the presence of grit within the lumen. Q. What is the function of the gizzard? Note the gall bladder lying on the right side dorsal to the liver – this structure is absent in some avian species. Note also the spleen cranial to the gizzard and to the right of the proventriculus. INTESTINES The duodenum arises from the right side of the gizzard just distal to the isthmus. It makes a long u-shaped loop caudally and follows the caudal curvature of the gizzard. The pancreas lies between its descending and ascending limbs. The cystic duct from the gall bladder, the hepatic duct from the liver and the pancreatic ducts empty into the distal end of the ascending duodenum. The coiled jejunum begins distal to the duct openings. The ileum is considered to begin opposite the apices of the caeca and is connected to both caeca along its length by the ileocaecal folds. The paired caeca arise at the ileocolic junction and run cranially, parallel to the ileum. Q. What is the function of the caeca? The large intestine/colon and rectum is relatively short and functions to reabsorb water and electrolytes. 63 The cloaca is a chamber that has three divisions separated by annular folds: 1) the coprodeum, into which the rectum opens 2) the urodeum, into which the oviduct/s (most avians retain only the left ovary and oviduct) or deferent ducts, as well as the ureters, open, and 3) the proctodeum, which opens to the exterior at the vent. The bursa of Fabricius, an important lymphoid organ, is located in the dorsal wall of the proctodeum. This is large in young birds but small or absent in adults. THE FOWL OROPHARYNX The orophaynx is the cavity that extends from the beak to the oesophagus. The roof of the oropharynx is formed by the palate. This has a long median cleft (the choana) that connects the oropharynx to the nasal cavity. This closes during swallowing. A shorter more caudal slit in the palate (the infundibular cleft) is the common opening of the auditory tubes. There are numerous caudally directed papillae on the walls of the oropharynx, along the caudal border of the tongue and demarcating the entrance to the oesophagus. The tongue lies on the floor of the cavity and is supported by a hyoid apparatus. Several sets of salivary glands discharge saliva through numerous openings in the walls. The laryngeal mound caudal to the base of the tongue has a median slit, the glottis, that is the entrance to the larynx. The glottis also closes during swallowing. Ventral aspect: viscera of domestic fowl (superficial).
