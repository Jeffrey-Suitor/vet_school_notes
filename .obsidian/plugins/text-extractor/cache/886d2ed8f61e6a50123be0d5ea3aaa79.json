Autocrine 2. Paracrine 3. Endocrine 4. Synaptic 5. Neuroendocrine Campbell, 2017 1. Autocrine Signalling • Cell releases a signalling molecule that binds to receptors on its own surface – the cell is talking to itself! • Common mechanism in cells of the immune system Campbell, 2017 2. Paracrine Signalling • Signal acts on neighbouring cells • Distributed by simple diffusion – action restricted to short distances • Molecule rapidly taken up by cells or degraded by extracellular enzymes → can create a signalling concentration gradient Campbell, 2017 2. Paracrine Signalling Example: histamine release from mast cells Localised response! 3. Endocrine Signalling • Secreted hormones are long-distance chemical messengers that travel in the bloodstream • Exert their effect on target cells in distant sites Campbell, 2017 3. Endocrine signalling • Only the target cells of a hormone have the specific membrane receptors for that hormone • Non-target cells are not influenced by hormones that contact them Which organs produce hormones? Merckvetmanual.com Major endocrine glands: • Hypothalamus & Pituitary gland (see next video) • Pineal gland (melatonin) • Thyroid gland (TH) and Parathyroid gland (PTH) • Adrenal gland (cortisol, adrenalin/epinephrine, aldosterone) • Pancreas (insulin, glucagon) • Ovaries (oestrogen, progesterone) • Testes (testosterone) Feedback control loops regulate hormone secretion Modified from Berne & Levy 2018 • Endocrine signalling contributes to maintenance of homeostasis, regulating a wide range of processes including: • Blood pressure and volume • Solute concentrations and body fluids • Growth and development • Negative feedback loops maintain hormone concentrations within a narrow range under normal conditions 4. Synaptic signalling - Neurons communicate with cells they innervate (target cells) by releasing neurotransmitters - Neurotransmitters are short-range chemical messengers released in response to electrical signals Campbell, 2017 5. Neuroendocrine signalling • Neurohormones are released into the bloodstream by neurosecretory neurons to act at distant sites • Neurosecretory neurons respond to an electrical signal Campbell, 2017 Neuroendocrine signalling • Neurohormones act like classical hormones, but are released from neurons Lecture 16: ILOs • Define the terms autocrine, paracrine, endocrine and synaptic signalling and explain why these different types of signalling processes exist • Describe the anatomical and functional arrangement of the Hypothalamo-Pituitary axis and how this axis regulates the release of pituitary hormones • List the hormones produced by the anterior and posterior pituitary and describe their main functions Cells to Systems Lecture 16: Principles of Cell Communication Video 2 Dr Laura Dooley Senior Lecturer laura.dooley@unimelb.edu.au VETS30015 / VETS90121 Lecture 16: ILOs • Define the terms autocrine, paracrine, endocrine and synaptic signalling and explain why these different types of signalling processes exist • Describe the anatomical and functional arrangement of the Hypothalamo-Pituitary axis and how this axis regulates the release of pituitary hormones • List the hormones produced by the anterior and posterior pituitary and describe their main functions Hypothalamus & Pituitary • Located at the base of the brain • Hypothalamus is a part of the brain • Pituitary gland is a small endocrine gland • They are connected by a thin connecting stalk • Release of hormones from pituitary is directly controlled by the hypothalamus Campbell, 2017 Hypothalamus • Hypothalamus receives information from nerves throughout the body • Initiates neuroendocrine signalling in response • This signalling controls the functions of the pituitary gland Silverthorn, 2018 Pituitary: two distinct lobes • Two anatomically & functionally distinct lobes: • Anterior pituitary consists of glandular epithelial tissues • Posterior pituitary is composed of neural tissue Posterior Pituitary Anterior Pituitary Posterior Pituitary • Extension of neural tissue in hypothalamus • Neurosecretory cells in hypothalamus synthesise ADH and oxytocin • These are packaged into secretory vesicles and transported to posterior pituitary along the axon • These are stored in the posterior pituitary and released in response to nerve signals in the brain • Enter into a plexus of blood capillaries – act as neurohormones Campbell, 2017 Posterior Pituitary Hormones Campbell, 2017 • Antidiuretic hormone (ADH,also known as ‘vasopressin’) main functions: 1. Retention of H2O in the kidneys 2. Contraction of arteriolar smooth muscle • Oxytocin main functions: 1. Controls ejection of milk during breast-feeding 2. Contraction of the uterus during labour Campbell, 2017 Oxytocin: an example of a simple neuroendocrine pathway Campbell, 2017 Anterior Pituitary • Hypothalamic neurons release neurohormones • Neurohormones travel directly to the anterior pituitary in the portal system • They trigger the release of hormones from endocrine cells located in the anterior pituitary Silverthorn, 2018 Anterior pituitary is an endocrine gland that secretes six hormones Silverthorn, 2018 Summary: Anterior Pituitary Hormones Pituitary cell Hormone produced Main target Primary function Thyrotrophs Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) Thyroid gland Stimulates release & production of thyroid hormones Corticotrophs Adreno- corticotropic hormone (ACTH) Adrenal gland Stimulates release & production of glucocorticoids Lactotrophs Prolactin (PRL) Mammary gland Stimulates and sustains milk production Gonadotrophs Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) Ovaries & testes Females: stimulates egg formation (growth & development of ovarian follicles) Males: helps stimulate sperm formation Luteinising hormone (LH) Ovaries & testes Females: stimulates ovulation, corpus luteum formation, estrogen & progesterone secretion Males: promotes testosterone secretion, sperm release Somatotrophs Growth hormone (GH) Most cells Stimulates postnatal somatic growth & development (IGF-I & II) Mobilizes fat stores, stimulates protein synthesis, inhibits insulin Anterior Pituitary: Regulation Two main factors that regulate the production of anterior pituitary hormones: 1. Hypothalamic hormones • Hypothalamic hormones are called releasing or inhibiting hormones • Each of the six anterior pituitary hormones is controlled by a releasing hormone or an inhibiting hormone – or both 2. Feedback from target gland hormones Campbell, 2017 Anterior Pituitary: Regulation Silverthorn, 2018 Anterior Pituitary: Regulation Silverthorn, 2018 Anterior Pituitary: Regulation Silverthorn, 2018 Anterior pituitary: feedback 1 2 3 Modified from Berne & Levy 2018 Three-tiered response: 1. Hypothalamic releasing & inhibiting hormones 2. Production of hormones in anterior pituitary 3. Production and secretion of hormones from peripheral glands Hormones act as feedback signals: ‘long loop’ and ‘short loop’ feedback Campbell, 2017 Campbell, 2017 Lecture 16: ILOs • Define the terms autocrine, paracrine, endocrine and synaptic signalling and explain why these different types of signalling processes exist • Describe the anatomical and functional arrangement of the Hypothalamo-Pituitary axis and how this axis regulates the release of pituitary hormones • List the hormones produced by the anterior and posterior pituitary and describe their main functions","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
