It is important to consider the question asked and the time allocated (if under exam conditions) when determining the specific elements of the flow diagram to include and level of detail required. Consider where the flow diagram should start and where it should finish, and then add the relevant steps in between. For example, if the question asks for a flow diagram related to pathophysiology, then aspects of treatment are not required. 2 Consider a similar scenario in a different animal species: How about a young cow with oesophageal obstruction caused by swallowing a potato whole? Recognise the additional elements of this flow diagram that relate to the function of the oesophagus in ruminants, in which bidirectional movement (particularly the eructation of gas produced by bacterial fermentation in the rumen) is essential to maintain health. Can you now see why oesophageal obstruction in a cow is a considerably more pressing emergency than in a horse? Would the flow chart for oesophageal obstruction in a dog be more similar to a horse or a cow? What is the relevant structure and function of the canine digestive tract that will influence this? What about oesophageal obstruction in a goat?","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
