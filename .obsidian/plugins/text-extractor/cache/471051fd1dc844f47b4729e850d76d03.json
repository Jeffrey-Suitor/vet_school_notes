Carbohydrates (glucose) 2. Fats (fatty acids) 3. Protein (amino acids) • Key biochemical processes that occur in the liver • Major metabolic effects of insulin and glucagon • Metabolic fates of acetyl-CoA Purpose of metabolism • Chemical processes in the body that sustain life • Oxidation of food to provide energy (ATP) • Food molecules converted into new cellular material • Processing of waste products to facilitate excretion • Generation of heat • Liver is central to these processes! Constituents of food 1. Carbohydrates 2. Fats 3. Proteins 4. Vitamins 5. Minerals 6. Fibre 7. Water Constituents of food • Carbohydrates • Sugars mostly as disaccharides (e.g. sucrose, lactose) or polysaccharides (e.g. starch) • Fats • Triacylglycerols (TAGs) • Proteins • Polypeptides of amino acids Highly regulated systemPostprandial state • High levels of nutrients in the blood • Glucose • Replenish glycogen stores in liver & skeletal muscle • Excess converted to TAGs • Fats • TAGs stored in adipocytes • Amino acids • Utilised by tissues for de novo protein synthesis • Excess converted to fat or glycogen Hormonal control • Insulin • Main signal to ‘store’ • Pancreatic β cells in response to high glucose • Glucagon • Main signal to ‘release’ • Pancreatic α cells in response to low glucose • Reciprocal control Energy release from food • Energy is derived from glucose, fat and amino acids in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) Hydrolysis of ATP to ADP & inorganic phosphate Energy release from foodEnergy release from foodEnergy release from glucose • Glucose or other sugars as ‘glucose-like’ substrates • Stored as glycogen in liver & skeletal mm. Periodic Acid Schiff (PAS) stain of muscle Stage 1: Glycolysis • Cytoplasmic • Splitting of glucose (6C) → 2x pyruvate (3C) • Net 2ATP & 2NADH • Does not require O2 Stage 2: TCA cycle • Mitochondrial matrix First step • Oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate • Irreversible release of CO2 • Acetyl group (2C) transferred to carrier Coenzyme A → acetyl-CoA Acetyl-CoA • Coenzyme A (CoA) is an acyl group carrier • Incorporates pantothenic acid (Vit. B5) • Acetyl-CoA is at the cross-roads of metabolism! • Fate of acetyl-CoA: 1. Feed into TCA cycle 2. Lipogenesis 3. Ketogenesis Stage 2: TCA cycle AKA Krebs cycle/Citric acid cycleStage 3: Oxidative phosphorylation • AKA Electron transport chain • Electrons from NADH/FADH2 “bump down a staircase” • Each fall releases energy • O2 is final electron acceptor Stage 3: Oxidative phosphorylationAerobic cellular respiration • Oxygen required as final electron acceptor in ETC • Although oxygen not utilised directly in TCA cycle, the availability of NAD+ becomes limiting when oxygen is not present Anaerobic cellular respiration • Anaerobic glycolysis: pyruvate → lactate • Lactate sustains glycolysis: • Yields only 2 ATP (net) per glucose (c.f. 38 ATP) • But 100x speed ox. phos. Lactic acid cycle • Lactate released from tissues and transported to liver • Lactate converted to glucose (requires energy) Lactic acid (Cori) cycle Energy release from fatsFatty acid (β) oxidation C atoms detached 2 at a time as acyl group → acetyl-CoA → TCA cycle Energy release from fats • Fatty acid oxidation differs from glucose oxidation in the preliminary formation of acetyl-CoA Role of the liver in fatty acid metabolism • Can utilise fatty acids as energy (β oxidation) • Lipogenesis/TG synthesis • Package TAGs with apoproteins as VLDL Fate of glycerol • Directed to liver or kidneys to be converted to glycolytic intermediates → feeds into glycolysis Fate of amino acidsEnergy release from amino acids • Deamination via transaminase • C-H skeletons used as fuel: • Pyruvate • Acetyl-CoA • TCA cycle intermediates Energy release from amino acids Amino acids can be glucogenic, ketogenic or both Gluconeogenesis • Most reactions opposite of glycolysis • Glucose production from non-carbohydrate substrates • Glycerol • Lactate, pyruvate • Gluconeogenic amino acids (esp. alanine, glutamine) • (Propionate – ruminants) • Acetyl-CoA is not gluconeogenic! • Mainly in liver (also in kidney) Intended learning outcomes • Outline how energy is derived from: 1.
