Connective tissue 2. Epithelial tissue 3. Muscular tissue 4. Nervous tissue Relationship of three- dimensional structure to appearance of section Copyright © University of Melbourne 2 CONNECTIVE TISSUE COMPOSITION: Composed of cells and extracellular (intercellular) material. • extracellular material: - amorphous (shapeless; = ‘ground substance’) - fluid (blood, lymph) - jelly-like (vitreous humour) - solid (cartilage, bone) - fibrous - ‘collagen’, ‘reticular’, ‘elastic’ Collagen fibres: - strong, flexible - white fibrous tissue - eosinophilic in H&E - mostly type I collagen, but variations in specialized tissues Reticular fibres: - fine network - poorly stained in H&E, black in reticulin stain - composed of varying combinations of collagens and extracellular matrix glycoproteins Collagen fibres Reticular fibres Amorphous extracellular material Cells Copyright © University of Melbourne 3 Elastic fibres: - stretchable, elastic - yellow fibrous tissue - eosinophilic in H&E; black in Verhoeff’s stain CONNECTIVE TISSUE PROPER Functions: • support • protection • connections within locomotor system • holds tissues together • energy storage Types: • loose (higher ratio of cells to fibres) • adipose (many fat cells) • dense (lower ratio of cells to fibres) - regularly arranged - irregularly arranged Cells: • mesenchymal cell - in embryonic tissues - stellate (star-shaped) - many cytoplasmic processes - oval/round nucleus • fibroblast - stellate or spindle-shaped - ovoid nucleus - abundant basophilic cytoplasm - synthesizes and secretes collagen and other extracellular matrix components - differentiates into fibrocyte Elastic fibres (Verhoeff’s stain) Fibroblasts Mesenchymal cells Copyright © University of Melbourne 4 • fibrocyte - small flattened elongated cell - elongated nucleus - very little cytoplasm - less active in secretion than fibroblast • macrophage - large cell - derived from blood monocyte - phagocytic cell (engulfs particulate matter including microorganisms and dead tissue) - produces lysosomal proteases (protein- degrading enzymes), cytokines, prostaglandins (substances that mediate inflammatory reactions Fibrocytes Macrophages Copyright © University of Melbourne 5 • fat cell (adipocyte) - accumulate fat droplets in cytoplasm - fat droplets coalesce to form single large fat droplet, displacing nucleus to side of cell - energy storage, insulation and protection • mast cell - scattered, in low numbers in most connective tissues (often close to blood vessels) - cytoplasm filled with granules containing heparin (anticoagulant), histamine (increases blood vessel permeability), serotonin (vasoconstrictor) and proteases - degranulate when tissue damaged • plasma cell - B lymphocyte actively producing antibody - eccentrically placed round nucleus with chromatin radially arranged - abundant basophilic cytoplasm - negative image (Golgi apparatus) prominent • melanocyte - pigment cell • occasional other cells, e.g. leucocytes Adipocytes Mast cells Plasma cells","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
