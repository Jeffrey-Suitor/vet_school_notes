Causes of hepatitis include blood-borne infectious agents (especially bacteria arriving from the gastrointestinal tract via the portal vein, but also circulating viruses, fungi and protozoa), trans-abdominal traumatic inoculation of bacteria into the liver (in cattle with hardware disease), trans-hepatic migration of parasite larvae, and (in dogs) immune-mediated inflammation. In this lecture, we will review the distribution patterns of hepatic parenchymal inflammation and emphasise how recognition of these patterns is important in reaching a specific and correct diagnosis. Inflammation may be centred on the biliary tree (cholangitis) and involve the extra-hepatic and/or intra-hepatic bile ducts. Inflammation that involves the intra-hepatic bile ducts may spill out from the portal areas to involve the adjacent hepatic parenchyma (cholangiohepatitis). Common causes of cholangitis/cholangiohepatitis in domestic animals include ascending bacterial infection from the duodenum (especially cats and horses), chronic liver fluke infestation (especially ruminants but also carnivores overseas), immune-mediated inflammation (cats), and plant and fungal toxins (ruminants). The potential consequences of cholangitis/cholangiohepatitis include obstructive jaundice, photosensitisation (herbivores), hepatic parenchymal atrophy and fibrosis, and progression to cirrhosis. Other causes of obstructive jaundice in domestic animals include occlusion of the distal biliary tree by scar tissue, neoplasia, luminal parasites, and (rarely) choleliths (gall stones). Rupture of the extra-hepatic biliary tree can lead to life-threatening bile peritonitis. The usual cause of rupture is abdominal trauma. However, rupture of the gall bladder can also be a consequence of inflammation (cholecystitis) or infarction of that organ or (in dogs) extreme distension of the gall bladder due to accumulation of excess luminal mucus (gall bladder mucocoele).
