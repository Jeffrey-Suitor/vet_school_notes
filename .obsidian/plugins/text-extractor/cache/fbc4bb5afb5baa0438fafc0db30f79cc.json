Do not jump ahead. • This file gives you detailed instructions for completing each activity. Ask your tutor if you have any questions. • For some activities, you will be asked to record your answers to the questions by typing them into this file. You should save this PDF file each time you complete one of these questions, to make sure that your work does not get lost. Guidelines for effective Group work Your group will work at its best when everyone feels comfortable and “safe” to contribute to discussion. Here are a few suggestions that might help promote a safe and effective group work environment: • Ensure that you all know one another’s names- and that you use them during your conversations. • Effective listening is a key to effective group work. Respectful listening enhances a positive group dynamic, and creates a space where it is safe for all to contribute. • Taking time to discuss is really important- discussing involves questioning and responding, reviewing and reflecting, sharing understanding. This is where deep learning occurs. It can often be greatly enhanced by visualisation- by sharing of ideas, summaries and processes on your white board and by collective rephrasing and reframing of ideas. • Sharing of tasks and responsibilities is also important in group work. Perhaps make a roster and each week have a different group member take responsibility for the keyboard, and for completing your interactive pdf. 3 instructions Enter each group member’s name, and email address below.

GROUP NUMBER Name Email Address 4 intended learninG outcomes This clinical case scenario is designed to integrate and enhance your learning in Cells to Systems. It utilizes a real-life case from veterinary practice to illustrate some of the concepts you have encountered in the course and their practical application. These cases are designed to stimulate thinking and discussion amongst yourselves and for this reason, are delivered in a small group format. If there are words you do not understand, please note them down and research their meaning using a veterinary dictionary! scenario Ms. Kearney is a registered breeder of Golden retrievers. Recently she noticed that one of her stud dogs called Bailey is behaving abnormally. Some days he is not himself, doesn’t want to play, and not interested in food. However, he recuperates and is playful and naughty again. In the last couple of days, Ms. Kearney has noticed that he is coughing and sometimes gags and trying to clear something from his throat. The frequency of coughing and gagging has increased recently so Ms. Kearney decided to seek veterinary attention. She brought Bailey to your clinic. QUESTION 1 • What are the clinical signs exhibited by Bailey? 5 QUESTION 2 • What initial questions you will ask Ms. Kearney? QUESTION 3 • What will you do next? QUIZ 1 Click back to the LMS and attempt Quiz 1 before continuing. 6 During the oral examination, you notice that both tonsils are enlarged, protrude from tonsillar crypts and moderately hyperaemic. The cervical lymph nodes are mildly enlarged too. Bailey had a temperature of 39.6°C. Bailey’s tonsils Normal tonsil in tonsilar crypts QUESTION 4 • What are your differentials for Bailey’s condition? For each differential diagnosis discuss how it will be causing the identified problem. (remember to use the VINDICATE mnemonic – used in Fridge cat case study; Vascular cause, Infectious causes, Neoplasia, Drugs, Idiopathic, Congenital, Autoimmune, Trauma, Endocrine). Discuss what will be the expected findings in physical examination with your differential list. QUESTION 5 • Do you require any further tests to determine the cause of Bailey’s condition? If so, what are they and the expected findings? 7 You have decided to take a surface swab of the tonsil and perform an in-house cytology preparation. QUESTION 6 • Identify the cells present in the image above. QUIZ 2 Click back to the LMS and attempt Quiz 2 before continuing. QUESTION 7 • Based on this information rank your initial differentials and discuss the reasons for the change in the ranking order. 8 You have recommended a full blood and urine examination to assess body systems in general, and Ms. Kearney was happy with that recommendation. You have performed venepuncture from the jugular vein and sent the samples to a laboratory for venipuncture and biochemical analysis. The RBC parameters and biochemistry were within normal limits. The WBC parameters are given below: Haematology Units Results Reference Interval White cell count x 109/L 18.6 4.0 – 13.3 Band neutrophils x 109/L 0.5 0 – 0.13 Segmented Neutrophils x 109/L 17.2 2.0 – 11.2 Lymphocytes x 109/L 0.36 0.78 – 3.36 Monocytes x 109/L 0.54 0 – 1.2 Eosinophils x 109/L 0 0 – 1.2 WBC morphology: Normal QUESTION 8 • Summarise the key haematology findings. QUESTION 9 • Interpret the haematology abnormalities identified. 9 You have conveyed the physical examination and laboratory findings to Ms. Kearney. You’ve discussed your findings and treatment options with the owner. Tonsils are part of the mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue and are constantly exposed to antigenic stimuli. Many bacteria native to the oropharyngeal mucosa could inhabit the tonsillar crypts. Examples of bacteria that can cause tonsillitis include Staphylococcus spp, Streptococcus spp, Escherichia coli. Another possibility is the extension of infection from the larynx, pharynx or oesophagus. The bacterial infection could be secondary due to trauma, or secondary bacterial invasion after a viral infection. For example, in dogs affected with canine distemper or canine parvoviral enteritis, the tonsils are prone to secondary bacterial invasion and suppuration. Bailey was treated with antibiotics and anti-inflammatories. He was prescribed with “Amoxyclav” at a dose rate of 12.5 mg/Kg, orally, twice daily for 14 days. To reduce the pain and inflammation he was given a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), “Meloxicam” at an initial dose of 0.2 mg/Kg orally on the first day, followed with 0.1 mg/Kg orally for next 6 more days. You have advised to give the medicine with or after food and advised to stop the medication if there is any vomiting or diarrhoea. QUESTION 10 • What other advice will be given to Ms. Kearney to manage the pain and discomfort in Bailey? 10 Ms. Kearney bought Bailey for follow-up assessment after 2 weeks. She informed you that Bailey responded to medication in the first few days, there was reduced gagging, was eating food, however in the second week, she had noticed that the symptoms are still present. She had the feeling that the gagging and coughing is worse than before. You have performed a physical examination and found that the cervical lymph nodes are enlarged and both tonsils are further enlarged. You have taken a fine needle aspirate of the enlarged lymph node. QUESTION 11 • Identify the cells in the following image and come up with a probable diagnosis. 11 The following image is an aspirate from a normal lymph node. QUESTION 12 • Compare with the above images and try to identify the cells in the normal lymph node. How is it different from the previous image from Bailey? What features allow you to reach a diagnosis? QUIZ 3 Click back to the LMS and attempt Quiz 3 before continuing. 12 You have informed Ms. Kearney, that the fine needle aspirate shows neoplastic lymphocytes and a strong suspicion of lymphoma. Biopsy and histopathology are the gold standards of diagnosis of lymphoma. You had recommended an excisional biopsy of the tonsils to grade the tumour and further investigations to stage the neoplasm. Do you know the anatomy of the tonsil? The following image is from a normal tonsil of a dog. QUESTION 13 • Identify the cell types in the normal tonsil above. QUESTION 14 • What is the function of the tonsil? 13 You have received the following biopsy report from the pathologist: Histopathology: Tonsil: Replacing the normal tonsillar architecture there is a poorly demarcated, unencapsulated, moderately cellular neoplasm composed of dense sheets of round cells supported by a pre- existing fine fibrovascular stroma. The cells are round, with scant cytoplasm and indistinct cell borders. The nuclei are intermediate- sized, approximately 1.5 to 2 times the diameter of the RBC, round to intended, and have ropey and marginated chromatin with one or two prominent nucleoli. The cells display moderate anisocytosis and anisokaryosis and the cells display six mitoses per 400X field. There are large numbers of apoptotic cells (starry night appearance) scattered within the neoplasm. There is a narrow band of connective tissue underlying the epithelium where the neoplastic cells have not infiltrated. Immunohistochemistry against CD3 and Pax 5 is recommended to identify the lineage of the neoplastic cells Diagnosis: Lymphoma - diffuse, mid grade, large cell QUESTION 15 • The following image is taken from the tonsils. Compare the architecture of the tonsil with the normal tonsil. List differences you can appreciate in this image 14 Perform some literature searches to answer the following questions. QUESTION 16 • What are the common causes of enlargement of tonsils in dogs? QUESTION 17 • What is the best way of diagnosing lymphoma in dogs? QUESTION 18 • What will you inform Ms. Kearney based on the cytology and histopathology report? 15 Bailey had undergone some additional testing to determine the subtype of lymphoma and to stage the neoplasm. Staging of lymphoma is a clinical classification of the disease. Complete staging would consist of the following 1) Complete blood analysis, urinalysis 2) Chest radiographs 3) abdominal radiographs or Ultrasound, 4) Bone marrow cytology, 5) immunophenotyping by (either immunohistochemistry (IHC), Immunocytochemistry (ICC), flow cytometry, PCR for Antigen Receptor Rearrangements (PARR)). There are 5 stages of lymphoma in the canine staging system: Stage I: Single node or site involved. No evidence of distant metastasis. Stage II: Two or more lymph node regions, both on the same side of the diaphragm. Stage III: Two or more lymph node regions on different sides of the diaphragm are involved. Stage IV: Any lymph nodes PLUS liver or spleen involvement. Stage V: Involvement of extra nodal tissue (e.g. bone-marrow, eye, lung, kidney, intestines). Bailey has been diagnosed with Stage II lymphoma. Staging is of limited prognostic value; Stage I to IV do not appear to differ in outcomes but identifying stage V will be of prognostic value. Bailey has been referred to veterinary oncologist for treatment. The treatment options are either chemotherapy or palliative therapy. There are a lot of lymphoma treatment protocols available in the literature. The best results are obtained with a protocol that combines the 4 most effective agents against lymphoma. CHOP based protocols are commonly used in canine medicine: • Cyclophosphamide, • Hydroxydaunorubicin (doxorubicin hydrochloride) • Oncovin (vincristine sulfate) • Prednisone This treatment regimen causes an 80 – 90 % remission rate, a median disease-free interval of 9 months, median survival of 12 months, and 20-25% survival to 2 years. With chemotherapy, there is a 10-15% risk of developing significant side effects. The side effects include gastrointestinal toxicity, myelosuppression, cardiotoxicity, hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity (common in cats). Bailey started chemotherapy and achieved remission. He was disease free at 9 months. Ms. Kearney is continuously monitoring him for any potential relapse. QUIZ 4 Click back to the LMS and attempt Quiz 4 before continuing.
