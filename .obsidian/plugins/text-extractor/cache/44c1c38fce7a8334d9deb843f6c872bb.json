What is steroid hepatopathy? What is stored in hepatocytes in this condition? What causes this condition in dogs? Veterinary Bioscience: Cells to Systems Pathology Practical – Degeneration and Necrosis 2 Dog, liver - See Video 1 The liver is enlarged and paler than normal because of steroid hepatopathy. What is steroid hepatopathy? What is stored in hepatocytes in this condition? Steroid hepatopathy is a condition of dogs in which hepatocytes accumulate excess glycogen in their cytoplasm. If sufficient glycogen is stored, the hepatocytes can become markedly swollen and the liver itself palpably enlarged. What causes this condition in dogs? Excess cortisol (due to hyperadrenocorticism or Cushing’s syndrome). The most common underlying cause in dogs is a functional pituitary tumour producing excess adrenocorticotrophin (ACTH) which in turn stimulates the adrenal cortices to produce excess cortisol. Less commonly, there may be a functional adrenocortical tumour producing excess cortisol in an autonomous fashion. Hyperadrenocorticism (and hence steroid hepatopathy) can also be caused in dogs by administration of excess corticosteroids (tablets, injections or topical applications). Veterinary Bioscience: Cells to Systems Pathology Practical – Degeneration and Necrosis 3 Donkey, portion of liver - See Video 2 What is wrong with the colour of the liver? What is the most likely cause? Only a few cell types commonly display this type of degenerative change sufficiently to be grossly obvious. Besides hepatocytes of the liver, which other cell types undergo this type of degeneration? Veterinary Bioscience: Cells to Systems Pathology Practical – Degeneration and Necrosis 4 Donkey, portion of liver - See Video 2 What is wrong with the colour of the liver? It is yellow rather than dark red-brown. What is the most likely cause? Hepatic lipidosis (= fatty change = fatty degeneration) Only a few cell types commonly display this type of degenerative change sufficiently to be grossly obvious. Besides hepatocytes of the liver, which other cell types undergo this type of degeneration? Renal tubular epithelial cells Striated muscle fibres (e.g. skeletal muscle fibres, myocardial fibres) These cell types play a role in lipid metabolism in health. The hepatocytes, however, play a pivotal role in lipid metabolism in health. The most spectacular cases of lipidosis tend to involve the liver rather than the kidneys, heart muscle or skeletal muscle. Veterinary Bioscience: Cells to Systems Pathology Practical – Degeneration and Necrosis 5 Sheep, kidney Is the kidney of normal colour? Why does the renal cortex have a striped appearance? Veterinary Bioscience: Cells to Systems Pathology Practical – Degeneration and Necrosis 6 Sheep, kidney Is the kidney of normal colour? No. The kidneys are normally a dark red-brown colour. This kidney has a yellow tinge to the cortex (the outer part of the kidney), particularly in the inner cortex. On cut surface, the yellow cortex also has a linear streaky or striped appearance. Why does the renal cortex have a striped appearance? There is excess lipid accumulating within epithelial cells lining elongate segments of the renal tubules that are lined up in register in the cortex. This is an example of fatty degeneration of the kidneys. Veterinary Bioscience: Cells to Systems Pathology Practical – Degeneration and Necrosis 7 Dog, kidneys These kidneys have abnormal pale-yellow linear stripes in the inner cortex. The stripes are due to degeneration of the epithelial cells lining particular segments of the renal cortical tubules. The degenerate cells may contain excess lipid (fatty degeneration), glycogen (e.g. diabetes mellitus) or water (hydropic degeneration).

Veterinary Bioscience: Cells to Systems Pathology Practical – Degeneration and Necrosis 11 Cat, kidneys – See Video 3 These are normal kidneys from cats. What might be stored in cells of the renal cortex to cause the gross pale cream to yellow colour? Veterinary Bioscience: Cells to Systems Pathology Practical – Degeneration and Necrosis 12 Cat, kidneys – See Video 3 These are normal kidneys from cats. What might be stored in cells of the renal cortex to cause the gross pale cream to yellow colour? Lipid. The lipid is stored in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells lining the proximal tubules of the renal cortex. The amount of lipid stored is influenced by sex steroid hormones. The most prominent physiological lipidosis is seen in the kidneys of pregnant queens and old toms. Veterinary Bioscience: Cells to Systems Pathology Practical – Degeneration and Necrosis 13 Dog, liver Is the liver of normal size? Is it a normal colour? What might have been added to the liver to explain the gross abnormalities? Veterinary Bioscience: Cells to Systems Pathology Practical – Degeneration and Necrosis 14 Dog, liver Is the liver of normal size? No. It is severely enlarged. The enlargement is indicated by the rounding of the lobe borders and the domed, squat profile of the organ. Is it a normal colour? No. It has a yellow tinge (which would have been more obvious when the organ was unfixed) instead of a normal dark red-brown colour. What might have been added to the liver to explain the gross abnormalities? There are several possibilities that could explain both the enlargement and diffuse pallor of the liver: e.g. accumulation of intra-cellular lipid or glycogen or extra-cellular amyloid, or severe infiltration by leukocytes (in hepatitis) or tumour cells. Of these, storage of excess lipid within hepatocytes is the most common change responsible for gross enlargement and pallor of the liver. A moderate to severe excess of lipid often results in a distinctive yellow tinge, with the parenchyma typically soft and friable and sometimes obviously greasy. Veterinary Bioscience: Cells to Systems Pathology Practical – Degeneration and Necrosis 15 Cow, kidney This kidney is diffusely enlarged and paler and firmer than normal due to chronic amyloid deposition. What is amyloid? Why might this cow have developed renal amyloidosis? Veterinary Bioscience: Cells to Systems Pathology Practical – Degeneration and Necrosis 16 Cow, kidney This kidney is diffusely enlarged and paler and firmer than normal due to chronic amyloid deposition. What is amyloid? Amyloid is an extracellular glycoprotein deposit composed of narrow linear fibrils that adopt a β- pleated, three-dimensional configuration that renders them difficult to be phagocytosed by macrophages. Why might this cow have developed renal amyloidosis? Amyloidosis in domestic animals usually involves the deposition of AA-type amyloid, i.e. amyloid derived from the precursor protein molecule, serum amyloid A. The latter is an acute phase protein normally produced by hepatocytes and released into the circulation. When an animal has an active inflammatory process or active tissue damage, the serum concentration of serum amyloid A increases due to increased hepatic synthesis. This alone does not necessarily render the animal to amyloidosis. Amyloid deposits would only be expected to accumulate if there was a concurrent problem – e.g. if the animal was producing a defective form of serum amyloid A that was resistant to proteolysis. Although inherited forms of amyloidosis are recognised in domestic animals (e.g. in Oriental breeds of cats), we would always search in an animal diagnosed with amyloidosis for an underlying inflammatory, infectious or other tissue destructive process that might be driving increased hepatic synthesis of serum amyloid A. For example, this cow might have had a chronic active inflammatory or infectious process (e.g. chronic mastitis, chronic pulmonary abscess, chronic hardware disease etc.) that was ultimately responsible for the amyloidosis. Veterinary Bioscience: Cells to Systems Pathology Practical – Degeneration and Necrosis 17 Horse Dog Horse, kidney and Dog, kidney – See Video 4 What is abnormal about these kidneys? What is the basic pathogenesis of this change? Veterinary Bioscience: Cells to Systems Pathology Practical – Degeneration and Necrosis 18 Horse Dog Horse, kidney and Dog, kidney – See Video 4 What is abnormal about these kidneys? There is severe chronic distension of the renal pelvis, a condition called hydronephrosis. What is the basic pathogenesis of this change? There is marked distension of the renal pelvis with degeneration/necrosis and loss of medullary tissue, due to chronic obstruction of urine outflow. The increased pressure in the medullary tissue adjacent to the expanding renal pelvis results in collapse of thin-walled veins and venules, tissue hypoxia and subsequent tissue atrophy and necrosis. Veterinary Bioscience: Cells to Systems Pathology Practical – Degeneration and Necrosis 19 Pig, skin Are these lesions inflammatory, degenerative or necrotic? Veterinary Bioscience: Cells to Systems Pathology Practical – Degeneration and Necrosis 20 Pig, skin Are these lesions inflammatory, degenerative or necrotic? Necrotic – and likely to reflect vascular compromise as a consequence of trauma from cannibalistic behaviour by other pigs. Veterinary Bioscience: Cells to Systems Pathology Practical – Degeneration and Necrosis 21 Pig, limb These are decubital ulcers (“pressure sores”). They develop in animals that are immobile and recumbent for prolonged periods. Stasis of venous blood due to gravitational pooling and external pressure on the down limbs from the weight of the animal contribute to the necrosis and ulceration of the skin.

How old are these lesions? Veterinary Bioscience: Cells to Systems Pathology Practical – Degeneration and Necrosis 24 Cow, skeletal muscle The dark areas are foci of necrosis induced by intramuscular injection of irritant antibiotics. How old are these lesions? The lesions are subacute – note the white border to the necrotic foci. This border represents where leukocytes are infiltrating the foci to lyse and phagocytose the necrotic debris. Veterinary Bioscience: Cells to Systems Pathology Practical – Degeneration and Necrosis 25 Eggs, fresh (left) and cooked (right) Why does cooking an egg change the colour and consistency of both the yolk and the egg white (albumen)? In which type of oncotic necrosis does an analogous change occur in the affected cells? Veterinary Bioscience: Cells to Systems Pathology Practical – Degeneration and Necrosis 26 Eggs, fresh (left) and cooked (right) Why does cooking an egg change the colour and consistency of both the yolk and the egg white (albumen)? Cooking denatures the proteins of the egg. In which type of oncotic necrosis does an analogous change occur in the affected cells? Coagulative necrosis In circumstances of critical hypoxic injury, all proteins of the affected cells undergo denaturation. Not only structural proteins are affected but also the cells’ enzymes, including their lysosomal enzymes. This is why coagulative necrosis is characterised by the retention of mummified remnants of the necrotic cells for at least several days after the event, as the cells cannot commence autolysis using their lysosomal enzymes. The necrotic remnants will remain until leukocytes reach them and release their proteolytic enzymes.

Coagulative necrosis Veterinary Bioscience: Cells to Systems Pathology Practical – Degeneration and Necrosis 29 Pigs, skin These pigs have had a systemic infection with the bacterium, Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae. Bacterial damage to the blood vessels of the skin have induced thrombus formation (i.e. blood clot formation within the lumina of the vessels). The thrombi have blocked oxygen supply to the skin. Which type of oncotic necrosis do you expect to occur in these circumstances? Why are the areas of necrosis dark red-brown?

Bacterial damage to the blood vessels of the skin have induced thrombus formation (i.e. blood clot formation within the lumina of the vessels). The thrombi have blocked oxygen supply to the skin. Which type of oncotic necrosis do you expect to occur in these circumstances? Coagulative necrosis Why are the areas of necrosis dark red-brown? Haemorrhage has occurred into the necrotic areas through the walls of the damaged blood vessels. Veterinary Bioscience: Cells to Systems Pathology Practical – Degeneration and Necrosis 31 Dog, brain This dog has a haemorrhagic infarct (a localised area of ischaemic injury) in the cortex of its brain. This was caused by a systemic bacterial infection with damage to vascular endothelium and subsequent thrombosis. What type of oncotic necrosis is likely to be present in this lesion? Veterinary Bioscience: Cells to Systems Pathology Practical – Degeneration and Necrosis 32 Dog, brain This dog has a haemorrhagic infarct (a localised area of ischaemic injury) in the cortex of its brain. This was caused by a systemic bacterial infection with damage to vascular endothelium and subsequent thrombosis. What type of oncotic necrosis is likely to be present in this lesion? Liquefactive necrosis In tissues other than the brain and spinal cord, ischaemic (hypoxic) injury typically induces coagulative necrosis. In the brain and spinal cord, the necrotic tissue liquefies and softens (malacia). Veterinary Bioscience: Cells to Systems Pathology Practical – Degeneration and Necrosis 33 Image: Dr Rech, Texas A and M University Cow, liver – See Video 5 The large area of necrosis in the liver is induced by exotoxins released by Clostridium species of bacteria. What type of necrosis do these bacteria typically cause? Veterinary Bioscience: Cells to Systems Pathology Practical – Degeneration and Necrosis 34 Image: Dr Rech, Texas A and M University Cow, liver – See Video 5 The large area of necrosis in the liver is induced by exotoxins released by Clostridium species of bacteria. What type of necrosis do these bacteria typically cause? Coagulative necrosis The exotoxins of clostridia cause rapid death of cells, with complete denaturation of the cells’ proteins. Typically, in so-called Black Disease of the liver, there is a single dormant clostridial spore in the hepatic parenchyma. The spore becomes activated by any condition which causes hypoxia. Once the vegetative bacillary form of the organism proliferates, it releases the necrotising exotoxins into the surrounding tissue. In the cow on the right, there is evidence of adult liver fluke (Fasciola hepatica) (see white arrow) in the lumen of a chronically inflamed and fibrotic bile duct. It is possible that previous migration of immature flukes through the hepatic parenchyma caused the hypoxic conditions conducive to activation of the spore. Subsequent entry of bacterial toxins and the bacteria themselves into the general circulation cause rapid death of the animal. Veterinary Bioscience: Cells to Systems Pathology Practical – Degeneration and Necrosis 35 Cow, palate – See Video 6 Across the surface of the hard palate (and also involving the lips and the ventral surface of the tongue) are multifocal to coalescing ulcers. These are caused by systemic infection with bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV), a pestivirus. The associated systemic disease is called mucosal disease. Veterinary Bioscience: Cells to Systems Pathology Practical – Degeneration and Necrosis 36 Veterinary Bioscience: Cells to Systems Pathology Practical – Degeneration and Necrosis 37 Sheep, skin – See Video 7 These sheep are suffering from a condition called primary photosensitisation. The sheep have ingested a photodynamic agent pre-formed in a plant (Brassica spp.). On exposure to ultraviolet radiation, the photodynamic agent is activated, resulting in generation of reactive oxygen species (free radicals) which damage the membranes of cells in the adjacent tissues. Self-trauma (due to itchiness) exacerbates the initial skin damage. What type of necrosis is occurring here?

On exposure to ultraviolet radiation, the photodynamic agent is activated, resulting in generation of reactive oxygen species (free radicals) which damage the membranes of cells in the adjacent tissues. Self-trauma (due to itchiness) exacerbates the initial skin damage. What type of necrosis is occurring here? Coagulative necrosis, referable to vascular damage with thrombosis Veterinary Bioscience: Cells to Systems Pathology Practical – Degeneration and Necrosis 39 Cow, liver These are foci of coagulative necrosis induced by embolism of the bacterium, Fusobacterium necrophorum, from the gastrointestinal tract via the portal vein. How old are these lesions? What might be contributing to the chalky white appearance of these lesions? Veterinary Bioscience: Cells to Systems Pathology Practical – Degeneration and Necrosis 40 Cow, liver These are foci of coagulative necrosis induced by embolism of the bacterium, Fusobacterium necrophorum, from the gastrointestinal tract via the portal vein. How old are these lesions? Chronic active (at least a week old) – note the broad cream-white border of fibrous tissue and phagocytosing leukocytes around most of these lesions. There is still, however, a lot of necrotic debris that needs to be removed from the centre of these lesions. The initial lesion is one of coagulative necrosis, due to local release of necrotising toxins by the proliferating bacteria. What might be contributing to the chalky white appearance of these lesions? Dystrophic mineralisation. Necrotic tissue often undergoes dystrophic mineralisation. Grossly, large amounts of mineral appear as chalky white, hard to gritty material. Veterinary Bioscience: Cells to Systems Pathology Practical – Degeneration and Necrosis 41 Sheep, liver – See Video 8 These foci of coagulative necrosis are very hard and gritty due to dystrophic mineralisation. Veterinary Bioscience: Cells to Systems Pathology Practical – Degeneration and Necrosis 42 Veterinary Bioscience: Cells to Systems Pathology Practical – Degeneration and Necrosis 43 Sheep, liver – See Video 9 The foci indicated by the arrows are areas of coagulative necrosis induced by the toxins of Fusobacterium necrophorum following embolism to the liver via the portal vein from the gastrointestinal tract. If the animal survives the initial localisation of the bacteria, what is expected to happen to these lesions over time? Veterinary Bioscience: Cells to Systems Pathology Practical – Degeneration and Necrosis 44 Sheep, liver – See Video 9 The foci indicated by the arrows are areas of coagulative necrosis induced by the toxins of Fusobacterium necrophorum following embolism to the liver via the portal vein from the gastrointestinal tract. If the animal survives the initial localisation of the bacteria, what is expected to happen to these lesions over time? Once sufficient leukocytes reach the areas of coagulative necrosis and release their proteolytic enzymes, the foci of necrosis will begin to liquefy. Phagocytosis of the necrotic debris by the infiltrating leukocytes will contribute to the softening of the lesions. Eventually, these foci would be expected to form conventional abscesses filled with liquid, neutrophil-rich pus. Veterinary Bioscience: Cells to Systems Pathology Practical – Degeneration and Necrosis 45 Sheep, liver This is an area of coagulative necrosis induced by Fusobacterium necrophorum. It is beginning to liquefy following the influx of leukocytes and release of their proteolytic enzymes. Veterinary Bioscience: Cells to Systems Pathology Practical – Degeneration and Necrosis 46 Veterinary Bioscience: Cells to Systems Pathology Practical – Degeneration and Necrosis 47 Cow, tongue This is a large focus of coagulative necrosis induced by toxins released by Fusobacterium necrophorum. F. necrophorum is a member of the normal oral cavity bacterial flora in a cow. Why has it caused this lesion? Is there anything distinctive grossly about coagulative necrosis? What is responsible for the dark red-black margin of this lesion? Veterinary Bioscience: Cells to Systems Pathology Practical – Degeneration and Necrosis 48 Cow, tongue This is a large focus of coagulative necrosis induced by toxins released by Fusobacterium necrophorum. F. necrophorum is a member of the normal oral cavity bacterial flora. Why has it caused this lesion? In health, the bacterium is found at the mucosal surface in small numbers. Once inoculated into living tissues (e.g. into the submucosa of the tongue via a traumatic ulcer), the organism proliferates and releases exotoxins that induce necrosis of adjacent cells. Is there anything distinctive grossly about coagulative necrosis? No. The distinctive feature of coagulative necrosis is microscopic – the persistence of hypereosinophilic, “mummified” remnants of the necrotic cells. The dead cells are incapable of initiating lysis of themselves as their own enzymes have been denatured by the bacterial toxins. Lysis of the necrotic tissue will be delayed until leukocytes infiltrate the lesion. What is responsible for the dark red-black margin of this lesion? There is increased arterial blood flow into capillary beds in viable tissue bordering the focus of necrosis. This is tissue hyperaemia, an expected component of the acute inflammatory response that living tissue mounts in response to adjacent necrosis. There may also be some minor haemorrhage into the marginal hyperaemic tissue. Veterinary Bioscience: Cells to Systems Pathology Practical – Degeneration and Necrosis 49 Dog, liver – See Video 10 Throughout the pale hepatic parenchyma, there are multifocal to coalescing and often locally extensive regions of dark brown to red discolouration. These are areas of necrosis with associated hemorrhage. The necrotic areas are depressed below the surface of the rest of the liver. What cellular processes are likely to explain the pale discolouration of most of the liver? Can you think of a possible cause of the hepatic damage in this dog? Veterinary Bioscience: Cells to Systems Pathology Practical – Degeneration and Necrosis 50 Dog, liver – See Video 10 Throughout the pale hepatic parenchyma, there are multifocal to coalescing and often locally extensive regions of dark brown to red discolouration. These are areas of necrosis with associated hemorrhage. The necrotic areas are depressed below the surface of the rest of the liver. What cellular processes are likely to explain the pale discolouration of most of the liver? Most of the hepatocytes have undergone sublethal injury (degeneration). Although some hepatocytes may be undergoing hydropic degeneration, the yellow appearance of the parenchyma in the image on the right suggests that fatty degeneration (lipidosis) is the dominant change. Can you think of a possible cause of the hepatic damage in this dog? This is most likely an acute toxic hepatopathy, e.g. from consumption of a large dose of aflatoxins (a potent fungal toxin) in spoiled feed. Veterinary Bioscience: Cells to Systems Pathology Practical – Degeneration and Necrosis 51 Fixed specimen of skin and muscle Fresh muscle (Image: Dr Rech, Texas A and M University) Cow, skin and skeletal muscle The skeletal muscle is necrotic due to the action of exotoxins released by proliferating Clostridium chauvoei bacteria. This condition is called blackleg. Why do the affected muscle and overlying subcutaneous tissues appear grossly dark red to black in this condition? What causes the small holes (arrows) in the muscle? Veterinary Bioscience: Cells to Systems Pathology Practical – Degeneration and Necrosis 52 Fixed specimen of skin and muscle Fresh muscle (Image: Dr Rech, Texas A and M University) Cow, skin and skeletal muscle The skeletal muscle is necrotic due to the action of exotoxins released by proliferating Clostridium chauvoei bacteria. This condition is called blackleg. Why do the affected muscle and overlying subcutaneous tissues appear grossly dark red to black in this condition? The name “blackleg” is derived from the red-black, blood-stained oedema fluid that accumulates in the affected necrotic skeletal muscle and in the overlying subcutaneous soft tissues. Clostridial exotoxins cause coagulative necrosis of everything that they contact, including blood vessel walls. The damaged blood vessels become more permeable than normal, resulting in seepage of oedema fluid and haemorrhage. Damaged blood vessels may also undergo thrombosis, resulting in hypoxic injury being superimposed on the tissue injury already induced by the bacterial toxins. What causes the small holes (arrows) in the muscle? These holes are formed by gas bubbles. The bacteria produce CO2 through fermentation of the necrotic tissue. The gas contributes to the spread of the bacteria and their toxins by further disrupting the damaged area and opening up fascial planes. It also means that the affected cadavers are usually malodorous! Veterinary Bioscience: Cells to Systems Pathology Practical – Degeneration and Necrosis 53 Cow, mammary gland The cavitating lesions in the udder are due to gangrenous bacterial mastitis. What does the term gangrene mean? Is this dry gangrene or wet gangrene? Veterinary Bioscience: Cells to Systems Pathology Practical – Degeneration and Necrosis 54 Cow, mammary gland The cavitating lesions in the udder are due to gangrenous bacterial mastitis. What does the term gangrene mean? Gangrene is an ancient term for coagulative necrosis. Is this dry gangrene or wet gangrene? This is wet gangrene in which necrotic tissue has liquefied and colonising bacteria have caused putrefaction. Blackleg is also an example of wet gangrene.

Veterinary Bioscience: Cells to Systems Pathology Practical – Degeneration and Necrosis 56 Sheep, spleen What is the most likely cause of this lesion? A bacterium, Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis What is the cream-yellow material that fills this lesion? Pus. Water is resorbed gradually over time from the pus, resulting in a dry crumbly appearance. What term best describes the appearance of this material? Caseous. Infection with this bacterial agent is common in sheep and is often referred to as caseous lymphadenitis or, colloquially, “cheesy gland”. Veterinary Bioscience: Cells to Systems Pathology Practical – Degeneration and Necrosis 57 Cow, mammary gland This cow has had chronic granulomatous infection of the mammary gland with the bacterium, Mycobacterium bovis (tuberculous mastitis). What term best describes the gross appearance of the inflammatory exudate within the ducts and parenchyma of the mammary gland? Why do bacteria such as Mycobacterium species often provoke this type of change in infected tissues? Veterinary Bioscience: Cells to Systems Pathology Practical – Degeneration and Necrosis 58 Cow, mammary gland This cow has had chronic granulomatous infection of the mammary gland with the bacterium, Mycobacterium bovis (tuberculous mastitis). What term best describes the gross appearance of the inflammatory exudate within the ducts and parenchyma of the mammary gland? Caseous Why do bacteria such as Mycobacterium species often provoke this type of change in infected tissues? Lipids in the walls of mycobacteria cannot be completely digested following phagocytosis by macrophages. Therefore, these infections tend to persist as chronic granulomatous or pyogranulomatous inflammatory foci (i.e. they are rich in macrophages or macrophages and neutrophils). Within such lesions, the original tissue architecture is obliterated over time and the necrotic debris fragments, resulting in a gross caseous appearance.

It is hard (instead of soft) and a brighter white than normal. Name the condition. Massive fat necrosis What might be potential adverse consequences of this condition? Massive fat necrosis of peritoneal fat stores is often an incidental finding in cattle. However, the firm fat may compress structures such as segments of intestines or a ureter. Large masses may also be mistaken for a foetus or a tumour on rectal palpation.

What is a sequestrum? A sequestrum is a focus of necrotic tissue that becomes walled off over time from surrounding viable tissue by fibrous tissue (scar tissue). The necrotic tissue may persist indefinitely and, in this case, is likely to harbour the infectious agent.

Veterinary Bioscience: Cells to Systems Pathology Practical – Degeneration and Necrosis 68 Dog, skin and subcutis The subcutaneous lesions are hard, gritty and chalky white. What process is likely to be responsible for the gross appearance of these lesions? Mineralisation (calcification) This dog has calcinosis circumscripta, a condition in which large lakes of calcium become deposited in tissues that have sustained injury and necrosis. Deposition of mineral in necrotic tissue is termed dystrophic mineralisation.

Veterinary Bioscience: Cells to Systems Pathology Practical – Degeneration and Necrosis 70 Sheep (left) and calf (right), heart and proximal aorta These animals were experimentally overdosed with vitamin D. Hypervitaminosis D induces hypercalcaemia (increased blood concentration of calcium), resulting in severe mineralisation of the walls of the aorta and other arteries. What term is used for mineralization of tissues caused by an increase in the blood concentration of calcium or other minerals? Metastatic mineralisation (or calcification) In metastatic mineralisation, the mineral is deposited in healthy tissue because the blood concentration of calcium or other minerals is increased. In dystrophic mineralisation, the mineral is deposited in necrotic tissue and the blood concentration of minerals is normal.","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
