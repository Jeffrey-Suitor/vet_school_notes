L E C T U R E O V E R V I E W This lecture will detail the comparative gross anatomy of the intestinal tracts of selected herbivore and omnivore species: horses, ruminants, pigs and birds. The intestinal tracts of these species are highly specialised, reflecting the different ways in which different species utilise different diets. Of particular interest is the way in which the hindgut of these species is adapted to facilitating microbial fermentation otherwise indigestible carbohydrates. The course and position of the different segments of the small and large intestines will be described, as well as comparative anatomy of the pancreas in these species and configuration of the duodenal papillae. The small intestine As in the dog and cat, the small intestines in the other domestic species consist of the duodenum, jejunum and ileum. Apart from the great length of the small intestine in the horse, ruminants and pig, there are some differences in the ducts opening on the major and minor duodenal papillae (either one or two pancreatic ducts). The large Intestine While in the dog, the large intestine is short and unspecialised (a simple tube only slightly larger in diameter than the small intestine), in the ruminants, horse and pig it is greatly enlarged and coiled. This reflects the contribution of bacterial digestion in the hindgut and the absorption of nutrients in the form of volatile fatty acids.
