She also worked in the United Kingdom on the clinical diagnosis and eradication of bovine spongiform encephalopathy before returning to Australia. She is a Diplomate of the American College of Veterinary Pathologists and previously served as a member of the international WSAVA multi- disciplinary team responsible for refining diagnostic criteria for hepatobiliary disorders of dogs and cats. Jenny’s research interests include disorders of the liver, pancreas, and cardiovascular and reproductive systems of domestic animals, diseases of New World camelids, causes of wastage in the horse racing industry, and applied aspects of clinical pathology.

Because of the large functional reserve and regenerative capacity of the liver, many hepatobiliary disease processes may remain clinically silent for protracted periods. Severe, acute, fulminant insults or chronic, persistent or repetitive insults to the liver that cause widespread hepatocellular degeneration and/or necrosis may result in the functional reserve capacity being exceeded. In such circumstances, not all of the normal functions of the liver will be lost simultaneously. Clinical signs that raise suspicion of hepatobiliary disease in domestic animals include: • jaundice (yellow discolouration of tissues due to imbibition of bilirubin) • various central nervous system signs reflecting hepatic encephalopathy and/or hypoglycaemia • inflammation and necrosis of the skin (hepatogenous photosensitisation) in herbivores • ascites (accumulation of non-inflammatory oedema fluid in the peritoneal cavity) • oedema elsewhere in the body • polyuria (increased urine volume) and polydipsia (increased water intake) • haemorrhage or increased tendency to bleed • crusting and erosion of skin, especially of the muzzle and footpads, in dogs (hepatocutaneous syndrome) • adverse responses to medication.
