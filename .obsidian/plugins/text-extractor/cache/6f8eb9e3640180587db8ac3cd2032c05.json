especially metabolic acidosis Potential Consequences • weight loss (ill thrift) • electrolyte depletion – sodium, potassium, bicarbonate • acid-base imbalance – especially metabolic acidosis • dehydration • hypovolaemic shock • death Major Sites of Water Absorption • Small intestine – all species • Proximal colon – carnivores • Spiral colon – ruminants and pigs • Small colon – horses Clinical Sign Small Intestinal Diarrhoea Large Intestinal Diarrhoea Frequency of defaecation Normal to mildly increased (2-3 x normal/day) Usually increased (> 3 x normal/day) Urgent defaecation Uncommon Common Faecal volume Often increased May be decreased (due to increased frequency of defaecation) Vomiting May occur and is usually associated with eating Uncommon (unrelated to eating if present) Weight loss Common Rare except in malignancy and other severe infiltrative disorders Appetite Variable Usually normal (but may be decreased or rarely increased) Steatorrhoea May be present Absent Mucoid faeces Rare except with ileal disease Common Tenesmus/dyschezia Uncommon but possible in chronic cases Common Melaena Possible Absent Haematochezia Absent Common Clinical Sign Small

increased mucosal permeability • malabsorption • osmotic drag • hypermotility Mechanisms of Diarrhoea • hypersecretion • increased mucosal permeability • malabsorption • osmotic drag • hypermotility Hypersecretion (Secretory Diarrhoea) • enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC colibacillosis) • some Salmonella spp. • Yersinia enterocolitica • Shigella spp. • Campylobacter jejuni • Vibrio cholerae Enterotoxigenic E. coli Hypersecretion (Secretory Diarrhoea) • enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC colibacillosis) • some Salmonella spp. • Yersinia enterocolitica • Shigella spp. • Campylobacter jejuni • Vibrio cholerae • local release of soluble factors promoting secretion and inhibiting absorption • bile salts entering the large intestine Mechanisms of Diarrhoea • hypersecretion • increased mucosal permeability • malabsorption • osmotic drag • hypermotility Increased Mucosal Permeability (Exudative Diarrhoea) Mucosal Necrosis, Erosion or Ulceration • Salmonella typhimurium, S. choleraesuis, S. dublin • Clostridium perfringens, C. difficile • Brachyspira hyodysenteriae (swine dysentery) • ulcerative viral infections – e.g. parvoviruses, BVD virus • cyathostomes (small strongyle nematodes) in horses • coccidiosis • ischaemic injury • infiltrative intestinal disease – e.g. lymphoma, Jöhne’s disease Increased Mucosal Permeability (Exudative Diarrhoea) Oedema of the Small Intestinal Lamina
