Abdominal view of the diaphragm of an animal in dorsal recumbency. Most of the peritoneal fluid in health drains through a plexus of lymphatics in the muscular part of the right ventral diaphragm (arrow). A flattened squamous monolayer of mesothelial cells over the splenic capsule (H&E stain) A monolayer of mesothelial cells lining a serosal cavity (H&E stain). These mesothelial cells are reactive and of cuboidal shape rather than forming an attenuated squamous layer that is typical of health. Highly reactive, tall columnar mesothelial cells over the surface of the hepatic capsule (H&E stain) Exfoliated and reactive mesothelial cells and accompanying neutrophils and erythrocytes in a smear of peritoneal fluid (Giemsa stain). Reactive mesothelial cells can undergo mitotic division (arrow indicates a mitotic figure). Cat with feline infectious peritonitis - fibrinous exudate in the peritoneal cavity (large arrow) and reactive mesothelium over the splenic capsule (small arrows) (H&E stain) Horse - acute fibrinosuppurative peritonitis due to ileal perforationHorse - subacute fibrinous peritonitis secondary to focal gastric perforation If fibrin persists in the peritoneal cavity for more than 3-4 days, granulation tissue will begin to grow into the exudate and eventually fibrous adhesions will form. Dog with chronic active septic peritonitis (H&E stain). Maturing granulation tissue (arrow) is extending from the abdominal wall into the exudate from areas where the mesothelial layer has been lost. Fibrinosuppurative exudate in peritoneal cavity Dog with chronic active septic peritonitis (H&E stain). Maturing granulation tissue arising from the abdominal wall. Cow – chronic pleural fibrous adhesions (arrows) in an animal that has recovered from septic pleuritis. The pleura responds to injury in the same way as the peritoneum. Any factor (e.g. sepsis, ischaemic necrosis, foreign body) that intensifies the inflammatory process is likely to result in adhesions in survivors of peritonitis. Decomposing emphysematous horse cadaver – unclotted blood-stained fluid is likely to be found in the serosal cavities during a necropsy examination Left dorsal displacement of the left dorsal and left ventral colon in a horse, with entrapment by the nephrosplenic ligament (between the left kidney and the spleen; arrow) A = spleen B = stomach C = liver E = left ventral colon F = left dorsal colon G = left kidney H = base of caecum Transverse view of horse abdomen. Arrow indicates the epiploic foramen, the entrance into the omental bursa. Horse - infarction of small intestine (arrow) due to left-to-right herniation through the epiploic foramen Human – small intestinal infarction due to herniation through a mesenteric tear Ventral abdominal hernia in a heavily pregnant ewe Foetal calf - schistosomus reflexus, with ventral herniation of the abdominal viscera head limbs Calf - schistosomus reflexus Pig – umbilical herniaPig – umbilical hernia Structures of the inguinal canal Bull – inguinal herniaBull – inguinal hernia progressing to a scrotal hernia Boar – scrotal hernia Boar – scrotal hernia Stallion – scrotal hernia Horizontal section through structures of the pelvic canal and perineum. In perineal hernias in dogs, retroperitoneal fat bulges through a defect between the coccygeus medialis muscle and the anterior margin of the anal sphincter. Dog – perineal hernia Dog - acquired (traumatic) pleuroperitoneal diaphragmatic herniaHorse - acquired pleuroperitoneal diaphragmatic hernia with acute haemothorax Cat - congenital peritoneopericardial diaphragmatic hernia with a large volume of abdominal viscera herniated into the thoracic cavity and pericardial sac Zebra - perforation of the abdominal cavity from the exterior Dog – traumatic laceration of the hepatic capsule – a potential cause of fatal haemoperitoneum Dog – implanted daughter spleens over the diaphragm following traumatic rupture of the splenic capsule Foal - acute fibrinous peritonitis secondary to caecal perforation Horse - acute septic peritonitis - caecal rupture Horse – infarcted caecum Horse – ante mortem gastric rupture along the greater curvature of the stomachHorse – post mortem gastric rupture Foal – large number of ascarid nematodes (Parascaris equorum) in the lumen of the small intestine Foal – subacute fibrinosuppurative peritonitis following impaction of the small intestine with ascarids and subsequent rupture Stephanurus dentatus (the pig kidney worm) encysted in the renal pelvis of a pigStephanurus dentatus migrating across the peritoneum in a pigDioctophyma renale, the giant kidney wormCalf – multiple hepatic capsular cysticerciCat – numerous peritoneal hydatid cystsDog - acute haemoperitoneum due to haemorrhage from uterine stump post spay Dog - traumatic hepatic lacerationCat – fatal haemoperitoneum following spontaneous rupture of the liver due to severe hepatic amyloidosis Dog – peritoneal implantation of haemangiosarcoma Hamster with severe ascites Dog - ascites due to right-sided congestive heart failure Dog - ascites due to right-sided congestive heart failureAbdominocentesis and cytological assessment of the ascitic fluid can help to distinguish the possible causes. Dog - serosanguineous ascites due to right-sided congestive heart failureDog – end-stage hepatic disease (cirrhosis) can cause ascites by raising the hydrostatic pressure in the hepatic sinusoids or in the portal vein itself.Horse with ascites and severe preputial oedema The cause of the ascites in the horse – lymphatic obstruction due to peritoneal carcinomatosis and implantation over the right ventral diaphragm. Ram with uroperitoneum due to urolithiasis and rupture Cat - chylothorax and mild chylous ascites (the bile staining of the ascitic fluid is a post mortem artifact) Dog - bile peritonitis Dog – pancreatic necrosis Dog - cytology of peritoneal effusion in septic peritonitis (Giemsa stain)Piglet - acute fibrinous peritonitis - Pasteurella multocida septicaemiaHorse - gastric rupture with acute diffuse septic peritonitis Cow – foreign body penetration through the reticulum with localised peritonitisCat with feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) Inflammation and thrombosis (arrow) of a renal stellate vein in a cat with FIP (H&E stain) Cat - FIP - wet form - effusive peritonitis Cat - FIP - hepatic and splenic pyogranulomas and non-septic peritoneal exudate Cat - FIP - omental pyogranulomas (arrows) Cat - FIP - renal pyogranulomas In horses, the omentum is small and has limited capacity to contain infection within the peritoneal cavity. Septic peritonitis in horses is usually generalised and fatal. In cattle, the omentum is large and can wall off septic foci within the peritoneal cavity, e.g. following penetration of the reticular wall by a sharp foreign body. Pig – peripancreatic enzymatic necrosis of mesenteric fat Dog – peripancreatic enzymatic necrosis of mesenteric fat – the hyperaemic margin indicates that these lesions are activeDog – active lesions of peripancreatic enzymatic necrosis of mesenteric fatSheep - multifocal fat necrosisCow - omental fat necrosis Cow - massive perirenal fat necrosis Cow - massive mesenteric fat necrosis with chronic small intestinal muscular hypertrophy Horse - venous infarction of small intestine due to strangulation by a pedunculated lipomaCalf - peritoneal and pleural mesothelioma Iron-encrusted asbestos fibres Calf - mesotheliomaCow - splenic capsular implants of carcinoma Ox - granulomatous peritonitis due to tuberculosis Dog - peritoneal carcinomatosis (implantation of hepatocellular carcinoma) Dog - peritoneal carcinomatosis due to implantation of a cholangiocellular (bile duct epithelium) carcinoma Dog - splenic haemangiosarcoma implantation over peritoneum Transverse section through the peritoneal cavity. The retroperitoneum is the loose connective tissue immediately external to the peritoneal cavity. The kidneys and adrenal glands are retroperitoneal in location. The retroperitoneum communicates cranially with the retropleural space and the mediastinum of the thoracic cavityy. Dog with episodic flank fistulation due to retroperitonitis Cat with retroperitoneal oedema and retroperitoneal perinephric pseudocysts Dog with a retroperitoneal and retropleural malignancy Dog with a disseminated fungal infection and severe retroperitoneal haemorrhage","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
