Do not jump ahead. • This file gives you detailed instructions for completing each activity. Ask your tutor if you have any questions. • For some activities, you will be asked to record your answers to the questions by typing them into this file. You should save this PDF file each time you complete one of these questions, to make sure that your work does not get lost. Guidelines for effective Group work Your group will work at its best when everyone feels comfortable and “safe” to contribute to discussion. Here are a few suggestions that might help promote a safe and effective group work environment: • Ensure that you all know one another’s names- and that you use them during your conversations. • Effective listening is a key to effective group work. Respectful listening enhances a positive group dynamic, and creates a space where it is safe for all to contribute. • Taking time to discuss is really important- discussing involves questioning and responding, reviewing and reflecting, sharing understanding. This is where deep learning occurs. It can often be greatly enhanced by visualisation- by sharing of ideas, summaries and processes on your white board and by collective rephrasing and reframing of ideas. • Sharing of tasks and responsibilities is also important in group work. Perhaps make a roster and each week have a different group member take responsibility for the keyboard, and for completing your interactive pdf. 3 instructions Enter each group member’s name, Iand email address below.

GROUP NUMBER Name Email Address 4 triGGer It’s 5.30pm on a busy Wednesday afternoon at Berylium Veterinary Hospital where you have recently started in your first job. Your appointment schedule is fully booked up until 7.00pm. Your receptionist manages to grab you between consultations to ask you about a phone call she has just taken. “Mr Taylor has just been on the phone asking if he can have an appointment this evening as he’s quite concerned about his 4 year old Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, Benji. Apparently he’s been vomiting all day, he’s listless and he won’t touch his food. I’ve told him I’ll phone back to tell him whether he can bring him in tonight or not. What do you want me to do?” QUESTION 1 • List the key information about Benji below. Key information is all the information that may be relevant in assessing his current condition. • Identify Benji’s main problem and make a list of how it may be caused using a systematic approach. We will call each item on this list a hypothesis. For each hypothesis discuss how it may be causing the identified problem. • What further information, which might be obtained from questioning the owner, will help you decide between your hypotheses? Discuss your reasoning behind each question. • Do you need to see Benji this evening or will it be OK to delay the appointment until tomorrow morning when you have plenty of free appointments? 5 history You decide that it would be best to see Benji this evening. You are unsure from the owner’s description exactly how sick Benji is and are concerned that he could potentially be dehydrated if he has been vomiting all day. Watch the following consultation video. Benji the Dog Consultation Video 1 QUESTION 2 Summarize the information obtained from the history taking. Now, watch the second version. Benji the Dog Consultation Video 2 6 QUESTION 3 • What additional information have you obtained from the second version of the consultation? • The vet communicated more effectively in version 2. List the elements of effective communication that you identified in version 2 when compared to version 1. • Based upon this information refine your hypotheses – decide whether they are more likely, less likely or can be excluded. Provide an explanation for each change. Give a mechanism for any new hypothesis. • What further information that you can obtain from a physical examination may help you refine your hypotheses? 7 physical examination While you are taking the history from Mr Taylor, you observe Benji. He spends most of his time sitting on the floor, whereas normally when he comes into the practice he is dashing around. You proceed to perform a physical examination with the findings summarized below. Parameter Findings Normal range Bodyweight 12 kg 7-11 kg Body condition score 7 1 = emaciated, 10 = obese Temperature 39.7 °C 38-39 °C Pulse 130 90-120 Respiration 20 20-30 Capillary refill time 1 s ‹2 s Mucous membranes Pink, slightly dry Pink and moist Skin turgor Decreased (skin tenting takes longer to disappear) Normal Thoracic examination NAD No abnormalities detected Abdominal examination No palpable intestinal foreign body, but seems quite tense and a little uncomfortable.

QUIZ 3 Click back to the LMS and attempt Quiz 3 before continuing. 11 Abdominal Radiography Normal radiographic appearance of a dog’s abdomen Radiographic appearance of a Benji’s abdomen Report: there is a loss of radiograhic definition in the pancreatic region, suggesting a localized peritonitis secondary to a pancreatitis. There is some gas in the colon, but no evidence of a radio-opaque foreign body or of an obstructive pattern (gas filled small intestine). 12 Abdominal Ultrasonography Report: the pancreas is enlarged and hypoechoic (darker than normal) and surrounded by hyperechoic (whiter than normal) mesentery. This is suggestive of pancreatitis with oedema (causing the hypoechogenicity) and peripancreatic fat necrosis (causing the hyperchogenicity). 13 QUESTION 6 Using the information you have obtained from your diagnostic tests are you able to reach a definitive diagnosis? Summarize below how the information you have obtained from the history, examination findings and investigation has allowed you to rule out your alternative hypotheses and reach this conclusion. 14 diaGnosis The information obtained from you history, physical examination and diagnostic testing leads you to the conclusion that Benji is suffering from pancreatitis, an inflammatory condition of the pancreas. Definitive diagnosis can only be reached by pancreatic biopsy and you feel that this is not justified in this case because it will not affect how you are going to treat him. Below is an image of a histological specimen of a normal canine pancreas. Alternatively you may follow this link to the Digital Slide Box. Below is a histological specimen from a dog with acute, necrotizing pancreatitis. Compare the appearance of this specimen with the normal pancreas. 15 Report: The image depicts the edge of a pancreatic lobules and peripancreatic fat. The pancreatic acini are small and surrounded by increased amounts of interstitial fibrous connective tissue (fibrosis). In the adjacent fat, there is a large region where there is loss of cellular detail (necrosis), surrounded by basophilic/dark blue material (calcium deposits, indicating saponification of the fat). Surrounding this there is a population of degenerate leukocytes, which infiltrate between and separate the adipocytes. Below is a necropsy photograph of a dog diagnosed with acute, necrotizing pancreatitis and above a histological specimen from that dog. The necrosis typically starts out at the periphery of one or more pancreatic lobules and usually extensively involves the peripancreatic fibrofatty connective tissues (as illustrated here). QUIZ 4 Click back to the LMS and attempt Quiz 4 before continuing. 16 QUESTION 7 • Now that a diagnosis of pancreatitis has been established, you are in a position to develop a flow diagram that proposes how this disease explains Benji’s presenting signs and other clinical findings. You should discuss this with your group and develop the diagram on the white board. (It may prove tricky to record this below - but the flow diagram should be kept for your future reference). 17 treatment There is no specific treatment for pancreatitis in the dog. Instead we provide symptomatic and supportive treatment to allow the pancreas to (hopefully) recover. QUESTION 8 • Based upon your clinical assessment of Benji, what symptomatic and supportive treatment should he receive? • List the management and treatment that you consider Benji should receive - and for each item on your list explain how it will help relieve specific clinical signs, or aid recovery of the pancreas • In veterinary practice you will need to inform the owner of the cost of the different treatments, together with the reason they are required. QUIZ 5 Click back to the LMS and attempt Quiz 5 before continuing. 18 proGress Benji is hospitalized for diagnosis and treatment. While in hospital he is commenced on intravenous fluids to correct his dehydration. He is put onto buprenorphine (an opioid analgesic) for pain relief and receives maropitant as an anti-emetic. Food is withheld to reduce secretion of pancreatic enzymes and so allow the pancreas to heal. After three days he is commenced on Hill’s i/d diet. Hill’s i/d diet is a commercial diet with reduced fat and high digestibility. Fortunately Benji makes a speedy recovery and is discharged from hospital on the Saturday morning. At a recheck appointment on the Monday, the owner reports he is almost back to his normal self and a follow up phone call on the Wednesday suggests he has made a full recovery. While on the phone to Mr Taylor on the Wednesday he asks you, “Are there likely to be any long term complications or problems from the pancreatitis?” QUESTION 9 • Outline how you would reply to this question and list to potential chronic sequelae based upon your understanding of pancreatic disease. QUIZ 5A Click back to the LMS and attempt Quiz 5A before continuing. 19 six months later... Oh no, not again! It’s a Wednesday evening and it’s 6.30pm and Mr Taylor is on the phone. He reports that Benji has been good since his episode of pancreatitis in October with no signs of any vomiting, but he has lost an awful lot of weight and has been passing large amounts of very smelly pale faeces of a soft consistency for the last few weeks. He wants to know if he can come down this evening for a consultation before you close at 7.00 pm. DISCUSSION QUESTION Do you... (a) Pull your hair out! (b) Tell him to come down straight away. (c) Tell him you are about to close and if he thinks it is an emergency, then he should go to the emergency centre. (d) Question him further about Benji’s physical state and book him an appointment for the next day, bringing a faecal sample with him. 20 foul smellinG diarrhoea! The next day Mr Taylor arrives with Benji, who looks much happier than when you saw him 6 months ago. However, he looks very thin compared to last time and you are horrified when you reweigh him to discover his weight has dropped from 12 to 8.3kg. You question Mr Taylor further. He reports that Benji has been eating well since his last visit and is still being fed Hill’s Science Diet Adult. He is drinking normally. He hasn’t vomited since his last visit, but is producing large amounts of pale, smelly faeces of a soft consistency. Mr Taylor has kindly brought you a faecal sample to examine! On examination Benji has a body condition score of 3/10 (previously 7/10), his vital signs are within normal limits and the rest of his physical examination is normal apart from changes to his skin. He now has a generalized seborrhea (dry, flakey skin). In view of his prior history of pancreatitis and his physical examination, you have a high index of suspicion that he has developed exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) secondary to destruction of acinar cells in the pancreas. You decide to send the faecal sample off for analysis. You decide against a repeat abdominal ultrasound. This is less likely to be diagnostic of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency compared with acute pancreatitis, because you suspect that as a result of scarring the pancreas is likely to be much reduced in size and therefore difficult to visualise. You also order a blood test for Trypsin like immunoreactivity (TLI). A low TLI level is a marker of the pancreatic damage associated with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. QUESTION 10 • Using your knowledge of pancreatic physiology and the pathophysiology of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, what results do you expect to get back from the faecal analysis testing for parasites, undigested fat, undigested protein, leukocytes, faecal occult blood and some common pathogenic bacteria, such as Salmonella and Campylobacter? 21 test results Faecal analysis Test Result Faecal flotation No parasites detected Microscopic examination Fat droplets present, no leukocytes or erythrocytes, no parasites detected Faecal occult blood Negative Faecal culture Negative for enteric pathogens Below: Dog EPI faecal smear with undigested lipid droplets and a muscle fragment (Sudan stain) Below: Dog EPI faecal smear with starch granules (Lugol’s iodine stain) 22 TLI result ‹1.0 ng/ml (normal 5.2-35 ng/ml) The results of the faecal tests and the TLI are highly suggestive of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI). Haematology and biochemistry was also performed on Benji. These tests showed a mild, non-regenerative anaemia and a normal blood glucose measurement. EPI is a relatively common sequel to acute pancreatitis - the inflammation of the pancreas results in loss of acinar cells and scarring of the pancreas, so that the exocrine secretory capacity of the pancreas is greatly reduced and pancreatic digestive secretion diminished. QUIZ 6 Click back to the LMS and attempt Quiz 6 before continuing. QUESTION 11 • How should we treat Benji for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency? Drawing upon your understanding of exocrine pancreatic and gastro-intestinal function choose the three most appropriate forms of treatment for Benji: (a) Feed him his normal diet. (b) Feed him a low fat, highly digestible diet. (c) Feed him on a high fat and high protein diet. (d) Feed him a pancreatic enzyme supplement. (e) Medicate him with ranitidine to reduce gastric acidity. (f) Medicate him with antibiotics continuously to prevent his diarrhoea. (g) Medicate him with antibiotics to suppress small intestinal bacterial overgrowth as required. (h) Medicate him with anticholinergics to reduce intestinal motility and thereby prevent the diarrhoea. • How you will explain to Mr Taylor the causes and consequences of exocrine pancreatic deficiency. What prognosis and recommendations will you give? 23 outcome Benji was diagnosed with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency nearly two years ago now. Since then he has been on Hill z/d ultra diet, together with a pancreatic enzyme supplement (Enzyplex powder). Hill’s z/d ultra diet contains highly digestible carbohydrate and fat together with hydrolysed protein and increased fatty acids. The diet reduces gastro-intestinal work load and the increased fatty acids improve the condition of his skin and help his seborrhoea. The pancreatic enzyme supplement assists with the digestive process, although there is controversy as to the amount of enzyme that passes intact into the small intestine and whether the food should be pre-incubated with the enzymes prior to it being fed. In the past people have advocated the use of H2 antagonists such as ranitidine to reduce gastric acidity to help preserve the exogenous pancreatic enzymes. Benji’s weight has increased to 9.4kg (from 8.3kg), but he has frequent bouts of diarrhoea. These are assumed to be a result of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and generally respond to treatment with antibiotics (amoxicillin or metronidazole). Benji’s illness will be a lifelong condition and he will require ongoing treatment. The cost of the Hill’s z/d diet alone is approximately $1000 for a year. In addition there is the cost of the Enzyplex and the frequent rechecks and antibiotics required to manage his condition. At this stage the owners have been willing to continue treatment, despite the fact that they are a single income family with young children. If Benji went on to develop diabetes mellitus secondary to chronic pancreatic fibrosis they have indicated that they would need to reassess the situation. 24 If you would like to see how the vet communicated about the most appropriate tests to run, watch the videoclip below.
