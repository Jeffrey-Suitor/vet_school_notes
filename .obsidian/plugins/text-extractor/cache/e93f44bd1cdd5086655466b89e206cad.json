Focal hepatic necrosis can result from focal bacterial infection - e.g. black disease induced by activation of a clostridial spore in the hepatic parenchyma. Multifocal Necrosis The most common pattern of hepatic necrosis is multifocal, due to recent embolism of infectious agents (especially bacteria but also fungi, protozoa and viruses). Multifocal (embolic) hepatic necrosis/hepatitis in a sheep Multifocal (embolic) hepatic necrosis (H&E stain) Cattle that survive episodes of embolic hepatic necrosis/embolic hepatitis may have the lesions repair without significant fibrosis. This process is believed to result in multiple small foci of sinusoidal dilation, visible grossly as tiny blood-filled lesions (telangiectasis). Multiple foci of telangiectasis in a bovine liver Multiple foci of telangiectasis in a bovine liver Zonal Necrosis A grossly obvious zonal pattern of necrosis in a horse (necrotic zones are red and depressed; zones undergoing fatty or hydropic degeneration are slightly raised and yellow) A grossly obvious zonal pattern means that a degenerative or necrotic process has targeted particular zones (e.g. 1, 2 or 3) within each acinus of the liver. Acute periacinar (centrilobular) (zone 3) necrosis (H&E stain) – these areas appear red due to haemorrhage secondary to necrosis; the blue areas are portal areas with prominent bile ducts. The most common pattern of zonal necrosis involves necrosis of hepatocytes in zone 3 (periacinar or centrilobular hepatocytes). This pattern is usually due to hypoxic or toxic injury to the zone 3 hepatocytes.

Mid-zonal necrosis may occur in sheep poisoned by toxic oils contained in Myoporum species of plants. Mid-zonal necrosis may occur in some animals poisoned by blue-green algae. Periportal necrosis is an unusual type of zonal pattern in which zone 1 hepatocytes are targeted. Periportal necrosis (above) cannot be reliably distinguished from periacinar or midzonal necrosis with the naked eye. Periportal necrosis is a feature of acute bovine liver disease (ABLD) in southern parts of Australia. Periportal necrosis is a feature of rabbit calicivirus infection. The infected rabbits die peracutely in disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), hence the haemorrhage from the nasal and oral cavities above. Massive Necrosis A variable pattern of necrosis in adjacent acini in a porcine liver (H&E stain) periacinar (centrilobular) necrosis periacinar and midzonal necrosis massive necrosis Massive necrosis can be caused by hepatic infarction (arrow indicates an infarct, a localised zone of ischaemic necrosis, in a dog). Massive ischaemic necrosis of a liver lobe in a dog due to lobe torsion Massive necrosis (necrosis of entire acini) due to sudden right-sided congestive heart failure in a cat (H&E stain) Dog – massive hepatic necrosis due to ingestion of toxic mushrooms Massive hepatic necrosis in a dog due to zinc toxicity Pig – massive hepatic necrosis due to hepatosis dietetica Pigs – massive hepatic necrosis due to hepatosis dietetica Pig – massive hepatic necrosis due to hepatosis dietetica Post-necrotic scarring in a pig due to previous massive necrosis caused by hepatosis dietetica Hepatic Fibrosis and Stellate Cells The perisinusoidal space contains delicate collagen fibres, stellate cells, nerve fibres and small numbers of surveillance lymphocytes. Hepatic stellate cells (Ito cells) – the major source of new collagen in hepatic fibrosisDelicate collagen framework of the normal liver (reticulin stain). The normal collagen framework is largely synthesised and maintained by the perisinusoidal stellate cells; endothelial cells and hepatocytes also contribute components to the extracellular matrix. Schematic diagram of an hepatic sinusoid (top) lined by pink-orange endothelial cells and containing blue and green Kupffer cells. The yellow-orange cell in the perisinusoidal space is a stellate cell. Hepatocytes are in the bottom row. Fibrosis is a common non-specific lesion seen in the livers of animals following hepatic necrosis or with persistent or recurrent inflammation of the hepatic parenchyma. The major source of new collagen in damaged livers is the stellate cell. In animals with recurrent or persistent inflammation or necrosis of the liver, signals from hepatocytes, leukocytes and/or activated Kupffer cells can promote mitotic division of stellate cells and their deposition of collagen in the perisinusoidal space. Progressive fibrosis (scarring) of the hepatic parenchyma is a major factor promoting the development of cirrhosis (end-stage liver disease). Deposition of collagen by stellate cells in the perisinusoidal space (space of Disse) leads to capillarisation of the sinusoids (with sealing of the normal capillary fenestrae). Transmission electron micrograph of an hepatic sinusoid and the perisinusoidal space (hepatocytes are to the left) E = erythrocytes (E) S = nucleus of an endothelial cell lining the sinusoid D = the perisinusoidal space (or space of Disse) Note that the hepatocytes have microvilli (Mv) that project into the perisinusoidal space to increase their surface area and promote the exchange of molecules. “Capillarisation of the sinusoids” can lead to a loss of surface microvilli from hepatocytes.Scanning electron micrograph of the lumen of an hepatic sinusoid. Arrows indicate the sinusoidal fenestrae through which you can see microvilli of hepatocytes projecting into the perisinusoidal space. These microvilli can be lost if the sinusoids become “capillarised”. Capillarisation of the sinusoids is likely to lead to progression to cirrhosis (end-stage liver). Horse with chronic bridging portal-portal and diffuse (dissecting) fibrosis – Masson’s trichrome stain to highlight collagen (green). Any fibrosis that bridges across the hepatic acini/lobules is likely to lead to progressive disease of the liver and eventually cirrhosis. Regeneration of the Liver The liver has considerable regenerative capacity, a phenomenon of which the ancient Greeks seem to have been aware, according to the myth of Prometheus. Hepatocytes are stable cells, the vast majority of which have left the cell cycle and are in GO (post-mitotic) phase. Following necrosis of hepatocytes, surviving hepatocytes may re-enter the cell cycle and undergo mitotic division to replace lost cells. In mature animals, periportal (zone 1) hepatocytes have the greatest capacity to undergo mitotic division. Restoration of hepatic mass by mitotic division of surviving periportal hepatocytes requires survival of the collagenous framework of the acinus/lobule. If the framework has been destroyed (e.g. due to massive necrosis), the acinus/lobule will collapse, resulting in coarse post-necrotic scarring. Even in massive necrosis, lost hepatocytes can still be replaced by mitotic division of oval cells of the cholangioles. Following division, oval cells can differentiate into hepatocytes or into bile duct epithelial cells. Proliferating oval cells in an animal with acute massive hepatic necrosis (H&E stain)Proliferating oval cells in an animal with acute massive hepatic necrosis (H&E stain) The cholangioles (or ducts of Hering) are the terminal bile ductules in the periportal zone that drain their bile into the intra-hepatic bile ducts in the portal areas. Oval cells are scattered amongst differentiated bile duct epithelial cells in the walls of these channels. Excessive bile ductular profiles (so-called biliary hyperplasia) are common features in the portal areas and periportal parenchyma following recent hepatic injury. They reflect recent proliferation of the oval cells. Sheep (H&E stain) Following chronic persistent or repetitive injury to the liver, the regeneration of hepatocytes is typically nodular in distribution (nodular hyperplasia of hepatocytes).

The size of the regenerative parenchymal nodules is NOT of diagnostic or prognostic value.Nodularity of the cut surface of the liver of a cow with chronic pyrrolizidine alkaloid poisoning. Green discolouration of some of the nodules indicates less than adequate biliary drainage. Cirrhosis • end-stage liver • diffuse involvement of the liver • bridging or diffuse fibrosis • regenerative nodular hyperplasia of surviving hepatocytes • abnormal intra-hepatic vascular anastomoses • permanent architectural distortion A cirrhotic liver causes increased resistance to entry of portal venous blood. This in turn can cause portal hypertension and congestion of the splanchnic viscera (stomach, intestines, pancreas and spleen and their mesenteries).
