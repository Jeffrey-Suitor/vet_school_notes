The liver is the first organ to receive ingested toxins absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract into the portal vein. Hepatocytes can also selectively take up and retain potentially toxic substances such as copper (above) or concentrate toxic substances in bile (e.g. sporidesmin from mouldy plant litter, right). Phase 1 biotransformation reactions are catalysed by the mixed function oxidase enzyme system of hepatocytes. Polar groups are added to or exposed in xenobiotics via oxidation or (less commonly) reduction or hydrolysis reactions. Phase 2 biotransformation reactions within hepatocytes involve conjugation with glucuronate (glucuronide), sulphate, reduced glutathione or other molecules to increase the water-solubility of the xenobiotic or of the products of phase 1 metabolism. A slightly more complicated diagram of Phase 1 and 2 reactions. Note that the ultimate derivatives of biotransformation reactions are water-soluble and hence excretable in bile or urine. Note also the importance of anti-oxidants to mop up reactive oxygen species generated during the biotransformation reactions. It is important to note that some drugs and toxins can be biotransformed via one or more Phase 2 reactions without prior modification via a Phase 1 reaction. Phase 1 biotransformation reactions catalysed by MFO enzymes take place in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes. Phase 2 biotransformation reactions mainly occur in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes. Hepatocytes in the periacinar zone (= zone 3, centrilobular zone) have the highest MFO enzyme activity. Humans are at risk of secondary poisoning by pyrrolizidine alkaloids in honey produced by bees consuming pollen from Alpine blue borage (viper’s bugloss) (Echium vulgare) or other Echium spp. (e.g. Paterson’s curse). Various legumes of the genus Indigofera contain the toxic amino acid, indospicine (a structural analogue of arginine), and the neurotoxin, 3 nitroproprionic acid (3-NPA). Indigofera spicata Horses consuming Birdsville indigo (Indigofera linnaei) develop neurological disease but not hepatotoxicity. If skeletal muscle from affected horses is fed to dogs, the indospicine in the muscle can cause fatal hepatotoxicity in the dogs (an example of secondary plant-associated poisoning). Predictable Versus Idiosyncratic Hepatotoxins Paracetamol is a predictable hepatoxin in cats. Aflatoxin B1 derived from fungal growth on spoiled feed such as peanuts is a predictable hepatotoxin in most species. A range of drugs recognised as idiosyncratic hepatotoxins in dogs and cats Free-ranging ruminants, ruminants under nutritional stress (e.g. drought, flood) and travelling stock are greatly at risk of plant-associated poisoning as they may be exposed to particular species of plants for the first time and/or they are hungry enough to consume unpalatable toxic plants. Competition for available feed can conversely sometimes reduce the risk of poisoning. For example, a high stocking density can reduce the risk and severity of facial eczema by decreasing the amount of toxic sporidesmin consumed by individual sheep exposed to mouldy feed/pasture litter. Naivity of juvenile animals can predispose them to hepatotoxicity if they are tempted to eat plants that mature members of the flock or herd ignore or avoid. However, adult animals have a greater volume of hepatocellular smooth endoplasmic reticulum and MFO enzyme activity than do juveniles, and can therefore potentially generate more toxic intermediate metabolites if they ingest a toxin that is metabolised in the liver. In general, males have a greater volume of hepatocellular smooth endoplasmic reticulum and MFO enzyme activity than do females. High levels of steroid hormones (e.g. testosterone, oestrogen, progesterone) can cause upregulation of hepatocellular MFO activity. Starvation can lead to a reduction in hepatocellular MFO activity due to catabolism of body proteins. Fatty livers that are exposed to reactive oxygen species generated during biotransformation of toxins are at high risk of cascading oxidative damage to phospholipid membranes. Acute Hepatotoxicity Acute hepatotoxicity often manifests as sudden death or a very brief period of illness with anorexia, abdominal pain, and mental dullness (or other signs indicative of hepatic encephalopathy) There is usually insufficient time for jaundice or (in herbivores) photosensitisation to develop.A zonal pattern is commonly seen grossly in animals that die from acute hepatotoxicity. The most common pattern of injury seen in acute plant-associated hepatotoxicity is zonal necrosis of periacinar (zone 3) hepatocytes. This is because periacinar hepatocytes usually contain the greatest concentration of mixed function oxidase (MFO) enzymes and may generate more toxic metabolites and reactive oxygen species during biotransformation processes. In severe intoxications, there may be massive hepatic necrosis (i.e. destruction of all hepatocytes within individual hepatic acini). Acute zonal to massive necrosis of hepatocytes in a pig (H&E stain). periacinar necrosis periacinar and midzonal necrosis massive necrosis Acute massive necrosis in dogs – mushroom poisoning (top left) and zinc poisoning (above and left) Chronic Hepatotoxicity Herbivores with chronic hepatotoxicity may exhibit jaundice, photosensitisation, signs of hepatic encephalopathy, and (especially if there is cirrhosis with portal hypertension) ascites. Cirrhotic liver from a cow with chronic pyrrolizidine alkaloid poisoning. Many of the hepatic lesions seen in chronic hepatotoxicity are non-specific – e.g. fibrosis, nodular regenerative hyperplasia, biliary hyperplasia, intra-hepatic cholestasis etc. Non-specific biliary hyperplasia and mild lymphocytic infiltration of portal areas in a sheep with chronic pyrrolizidine alkaloid poisoning (H&E stain) Horse with chronic pyrrolizidine alkaloid poisoning and non-specific bridging portal-portal and diffuse (dissecting) fibrosis – Masson’s trichrome stain to highlight collagen (green) In some chronic intoxications, lesions of diagnostic significance may be identifiable microscopically in the liver. For example, hepatocellular megalocytosis and karyomegaly are suggestive of chronic exposure to alkylating toxins, especially pyrrolizidine alkaloids but also aflatoxins (H&E stain). Common Acute Hepatotoxins Several genera of mushrooms contain potent hepatotoxins, especially Amanita species. Consumption of poisonous mushrooms typically provokes massive hepatic necrosis, as in this dog. The necrotic areas of parenchyma are dark red and collapsed below the surviving parenchyma.Algal water bloom (Anacystis cyanea) on stagnant water Algal blooms pose a toxic risk to a wide range of species. Run-off of water rich in nitrogen or phosphate from fertilised pasture may encourage growth of blue-green algal blooms in stagnant water. Prevailing winds may drive the bloom to shore where animals with no other available source of water are forced to drink algal toxins. Dead and dying algae release preformed toxins. Hepatotoxins induce acute periacinar to massive hepatic necrosis. Occasionally, they induce periportal (zone 1) to midzonal (zone 2) hepatic necrosis. Acute Bovine Liver Disease (ABLD) is a common condition in cattle in Victoria and Tasmania. The syndrome is characterised by sudden death or by subacute disease with development of hepatogenous photosensitisation (early stages shown above) and signs of hepatic encephalopathy. The typical histological lesion is periportal (zone 1) hepatic necrosis. Originally, acute bovine liver disease was thought to be due to a toxin in rough dog’s tail (Cynosurus echinatus). Currently, acute bovine liver disease is suspected to be due to a mycotoxin produced by the fungus, Drechslera biseptata, growing on pasture. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) induces acute hepatoxicity in cats and occasionally dogs. This diagram shows how hepatocytes in humans metabolise paracetamol (acetaminophen). In contrast, feline hepatocytes have limited capacity to biotransform paracetamol via glucuronate or sulphate pathways. Cats are therefore forced to process much of the paracetamol via the mixed function oxidase enzyme (P450) pathway, generating a more toxic intermediate metabolite, NAPQI, and reactive oxygen species. If hepatocellular gluthathione is depleted, these toxic metabolites cannot be neutralised, resulting in hepatocellular necrosis. Gluathione depletion also predisposes the erythrocytes of cats ingesting paracetamol to oxidative injury. Oxyhaemoglobin (HbFe 2+) is converted to methaemoglobin (HbFe 3+) and denatured areas of haemoglobin form Heinz bodies (arrows) and predispose the erythrocytes to intra-vascular or extra-vascular haemolysis (peripheral blood smear stained with new methylene blue). Iron administered orally or parenterally can induce massive hepatic necrosis, akin to spontaneously occurring hepatosis dietetica in young growing pigs (above). Due to its valency, iron can generate reactive oxygen species and hence peroxidation of cell membrane phospholipids. Iron injections in piglets that are deficient in anti-oxidants can trigger massive hepatic necrosis and/or skeletal muscle necrosis. Acute hepatic necrosis (zonal or massive) has also been reported in calves, neonatal foals, young cattle and adult horses following injection or oral administration of supplements containing iron. Cycads Green cestrum (Cestrum parqui) Poison peach (Trema aspera) Noogoora burr (Xanthium pungens) Ellangowan poison bush (Myoporum deserti) Toxic oils in Myoporum spp. (e.g. boobialla) typically cause midzonal (zone 2) hepatic necrosis. However, they may cause periportal (zone 1) or periacinar (zone 3) necrosis if there has been prior suppression or induction of MFO enzyme activity respectively.

Sheep and goats are more resistant and are more likely to be poisoned after low level consumption over two growing seasons. Horses and cattle have intermediate susceptibility. Pyrrolizidine alkaloid poisoning is recognised in humans, e.g. after consumption in herbal preparations and “bush teas”. Chronic pulmonary fibrosis in horses due to intra-pulmonary metabolism of pyrrolizidine alkaloids after ingestion of Crotalaria species. Aflatoxins are produced by Aspergillus and Penicillium fungi, often during storage of fungus- contamined feed in moist and warm conditions. Aflatoxin-producing mould growing on peanutsGarbage ingestion by dogs is a potential cause of aflatoxicosis. Ingestion of spoiled dry feed is also a potential cause of aflatoxicosis in dogs. Typical hepatic lesions of chronic aflatoxicosis in dogs and other species include nodular hyperplasia, biliary hyperplasia, portal/periportal fibrosis (top right, with a trichrome stain used to highlight the blue collagen), lipidosis of surviving hepatocytes (bottom left) and scattered karyomegalic hepatocytes (bottom right, arrows). LupinsPhomopsis leptostromiformis mould growing on stalks and seeds of lupinsChronic lupinosis in a sheep – chronic portal and centrilobular fibrosis, biliary hyperplasia and hepatocellular lipidosis (H&E stain)Lantana (Lantana camara) British breeds of sheep are most susceptible to chronic copper poisoning. There is an increased risk of chronic copper poisoning in sheep if there is increased dietary intake of copper, increased availability of dietary copper (e.g. a zinc-deficient diet) or if there is concurrent disease impairing hepatocellular mitosis (e.g. chronic pyrrolizidine alkaloid poisoning). Copper water pipes and copper sulfate footbaths (to control foot rot) can increase the uptake of copper in sheep and predispose to chronic copper poisoning. Hepatocellular apoptosis in chronic copper poisoning (H&E stain) As dying hepatocytes in chronic copper poisoning need to be replaced by mitotic division, concurrent exposure to hepatoxins that result in mitotic arrest (e.g. pyrrolizidine alkaloids, aflatoxins, phomopsin) can result in progressive atrophy of the liver and ultimately a peracute haemolytic crisis. Sheep that has died due to an acute haemolytic crisis caused by chronic copper poisoning – jaundice, enlarged gall bladder and haemoglobinuria (note colour of kidney and urine in bladder) Sheep with chronic copper poisoning – pale (anaemic) and jaundiced liver and distension of gall bladder by dark green bile Chronic copper poisoning in a sheep – discolouration of kidneys and urine due to haemoglobinuria and bilirubinuria + jaundice of subcutaneous fat plugged canaliculi inflammatory response to free bile Severe cholestasis in a sheep with chronic copper poisoning. Note the hepatocellular megalocytosis caused by chronic pyrrolizidine alkaloid poisoning. (H&E stain) Hyperplastic Lesions Numerous regenerative hyperplastic nodules in a cirrhotic liver of a dog. Middle-aged and older dogs often develop a small number of hepatic hyperplastic nodules in an otherwise normal liver. The reason why they do so is obscure.Idiopathic nodular hyperplasia of hepatocytes in a dog (H&E stain)Hepatocellular lipidosis within an idiopathic hyperplastic nodule in a dog (H&E stain) Margin of a hyperplastic nodule with hepatocellular lipidosis (H&E stain) Cystic mucinous hyperplasia of the gall bladder mucosa in a dog Cystic mucinous hyperplasia of the gall bladder mucosa in a dog Cystic mucinous hyperplasia of the gall bladder mucosa in a dog – distended, mucin-filled glands (H&E stain) Cystic mucinous hyperplasia of the gall bladder mucosa in a dog – a markedly distended, mucin-filled gland (H&E stain) Cystic mucinous hyperplasia of the gall bladder mucosa in a dog – a markedly distended, mucin-filled gland (H&E stain) Gall bladder mucocoele in a dog – a large plug of mucin filling the opened gall bladder. Cystic mucinous hyperplasia of the gall bladder mucosa is usually identifiable in dogs with mucocoeles but it is not the underlying cause.
