Axon branches Mitochondria Acetylcholine Synaptic vesicles Synaptic cleft Folded sarcolemma Motor end plate Myofibril of muscle fiber Muscle fiber nucleus Motor neuron axon • Acetylcholine (ACh) • Nerve impulse causes release of ACh from synaptic vesicles • ACh binds to ACh receptors on motor end plate • Generates a muscle impulse • Muscle impulse eventually reaches the SR and the cisternae Animation: Function of the Neuromuscular Junction 7 Please note that due to differing operating systems, some animations will not appear until the presentation is viewed in Presentation Mode (Slide Show view). You may see blank slides in the “Normal” or “Slide Sorter” views. All animations will appear after viewing in Presentation Mode and playing each animation.

Actin monomers Release of Ca+2 from sarcoplasmic reticulum exposes binding sites on actin: Muscle contraction Muscle relaxation Active transport of Ca+2 into sarcoplasmic reticulum, which requires ATP, makes myosin binding sites unavailable.
