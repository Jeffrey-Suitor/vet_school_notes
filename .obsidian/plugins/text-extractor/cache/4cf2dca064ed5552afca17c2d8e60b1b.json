Granules are released to respond to the parasite & allergens. • Eosinophil granules react with products from basophils, mast cells, lymphocytes eg. eosinophil granules contain histaminase which inactivates histamine • Typically the nucleus is bi-lobed, not multi-lobed as in the neutrophils • Considerable species variation in morphology horse dog cat Alpaca sheep Eosinophils Masked owl Eosinophils Basophils • Normally only present in small numbers in blood (approximately 0.5% of the total leukocytes). • Absent in cats, rats & mice • Basophil granules contain heparin & vasoactive compounds such as histamine • Basophils participate in modulating inflammatory reactions • Involved in immediate hypersensitivities, e.g. allergic reactions to bee stings Monocytes Large (16-25 µm), circulating, phagocytic white blood cell, having a single well-defined nucleus & very fine granulation in the cytoplasm Monocytes constitute usually less than 10% of the circulation leukocytes in dogs, cats & horses The nucleus varies in form & may be kidney shaped, bean shaped, or horseshoe shaped with a deep indentation Macrophages • Monocytes – circulate the body in the blood • Monocytes exit the blood & mature into macrophages • Macrophages are phagocytic cells that process & present antigen to cells of the adaptive immune system • Macrophages are antigen presenting cells (APCs) • APCs are found in the skin (called Langerhan’s cells), lymph nodes, spleen, mucosal epithelia & thymus Macrophages Type of macrophage Location Function Alveolar macrophage Lung alveoli Phagocytosis of small particles, dead cells or bacteria. Initiation and control of immunity to respiratory pathogens Kupffer cells Liver Initiate immune responses and hepatic tissue remodelling. Microglia Central nervous system Elimination of old or dead neurons and control of immunity in the brain. Splenic macrophages (marginal zone, metallophilic and red pulp macrophages) Spleen marginal zone, red and white pulp Elimination of dysfunctional or old red blood cells. https://www.immunology.org/public-information/bitesized-immunology/cells/macrophages Mononuclear Phagocytic cells • Macrophages • Dendritic cells Lung Regions A B C Airway Regions A B Myeloid DC CD11c+ class IIhi CD205+ Myeloid DC CD11c+ class IIhi CD205+ Macrophage CD11c+ class IIlo CD2+ Macrophages & dendritic cells last for long times in tissues & can sequestrate resistant pathogens Dendritic cells • A network of dendritic cells (DC) forms a front line defence on mucosal surfaces • DC recognise, process & present antigen on their cell surface to initiate T cell responses • DC can migrate from mucosal surfaces/ tissues & traffic to the nearby (draining) lymph nodes where they interact with T cells • DC are professional antigen presenting cells nature.com Natural Killer (NK) cell NK cells have cell surface receptors that can recognise foreign cells (tumours & altered cells infected with virus) Activated NK cells respond with non-specific cytotoxic functions. Normal cells of the body are protected from cytotoxicity mediated by NK cells. http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2016-05/waeh-ht052016.php Chemical signals controlling cells of the innate & adaptive immune systems • Lipid derived – released • Prostaglandins, leukotrienes, eicosonoids • Protein derived – secreted • Cytokines Prostaglandin, Leukotrienes, Eicosanoids • Lipid mediators of inflammation & immune regulation derived from arachidonic acid (a normal membrane omega-6 fatty acid) • Released by injured cells • They can also serve as secondary messengers in some events triggered by cytokines Cytokines • Very small proteins that work as messengers between cells • Involved in innate and adaptive immune responses • Typically work over short distances • Autocrine • Paracrine • Some have endocrine effects • Make up a signaling network that controls the immune response Cytokines • MANY different cytokines, produced by many cell types • Single cytokine can act on many different cell types (pleiotropy) • Many cytokines have the same jobs/functions (redundancy/synergy) • Some cytokines antagonise the effects of others • Most are pro-inflammatory, some are anti-inflammatory • Secretion usually transient • Extremely potent Who’s who of cytokines • Meet the families: 1. Tumour necrosis factors 2. Interleukins 3. Chemokines 4. Colony stimulating factors 5. Transforming growth factors 6.
