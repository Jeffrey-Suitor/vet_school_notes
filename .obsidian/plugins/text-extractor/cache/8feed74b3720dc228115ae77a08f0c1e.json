Muscles of left thoracic wall removed to expose thoracic cavity between ribs 7 and 13. The abdominal cavity has been opened via a ventral midline incision and the rectus abdominis and external abdominal oblique muscles reflected caudo-ventrally. The ventral portion of the left lateral lobe of the liver can be seen Extending beyond the costal arch. ‘x’=xiphoid process Canine Greyhound, right lateral recumbency. The portion of each of ribs 8 to 12 between the costo-chondral junction and the ventral margin of the epaxial musculature has now been removed . Intercostal muscles have been removed to the level of the attachment of the diaphragm to the medial aspect of the ribs. Canine Greyhound, right lateral recumbency. The diaphragm has been incised along its attachment to the ribs of the left thoracic wall and reflected cranially to expose the liver and other structures that lie, at least in part, cranial to the costal arch. Canine Greyhound, left lateral recumbency. Muscles of right thoracic wall removed to expose thoracic cavity between ribs 7 and 13. The abdominal cavity has been opened via a ventral midline incision and the rectus abdominis and external abdominal oblique muscles reflected caudo-ventrally. The ventral portions of the left lateral lobe and right medial lobe of the liver can be seen extending beyond the costal arch. Canine Greyhound, left lateral recumbency.

The diaphragm has been incised along its attachment to the ribs of the right thoracic wall and reflected cranially. ‘rk’ = right kidney Canine Male DSH in dorsal recumbency. A midline incision has been made through the abdominal wall along the linea alba with further incisions through all layers of the abdominal muscles along the costal arch. The abdominal muscles have then been reflected caudo laterally. The xiphoid process is being retracted to facilitate exposure of structures that may be seen extending caudal to the costal arch. ‘l. lat’ =left lateral lobe, ‘l. med’ = left medial lobe, ‘quad’ = quadrate lobe and ‘r. med’ = right medial lobe of liver, ‘ xiph’ = xiphoid process Feline Male DSH cat, right lateral recumbency. The muscles over the left thoracic wall have been removed between ribs 6 and 13, the portion of ribs 7-12 between the costochondral junction and the epaxial muscles removed, the diaphragm incised at its attachment to the ribs and reflected cranially and the abdominal muscles reflected caudally. ‘x’ = xiphoid process Feline Male DSH cat, left lateral recumbency. The muscles over the right thoracic wall have been removed between ribs 7 and 13, the portion of ribs 8-12 between the costochondral junction and the epaxial muscles removed, the diaphragm incised along its attachment to the ribs and reflected cranially and the abdominal muscles reflected caudally.
