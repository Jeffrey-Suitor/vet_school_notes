C L A S S P R E P A R A T I O N - A video tutorial is available on the LMS. Students should review this prior to attending class. 1. S H E E P H E A D D I S S E C T I O N Your table has been provided with one sheep head that has been sectioned along the median plane. Work in two groups, with half a head each. You may find some structures are easier to identify in one section or the other, as a perfect midline cut is difficult to achieve. You will be expected to know the structures that are highlighted in bold type. Dissection: Incise the skin around the nostril and lips, around the eye following the bony orbit and around the base of the ear. Using rat-toothed forceps and a scalpel, carefully remove the skin from the entire head, just leaving behind the skin surrounding the nostril, lips, eye and ear. You should start from one of the cut edges of the head, trying to leave as much subcutaneous tissue intact as you can. Then remove the thin layer of subcutaneous muscle and the layer of fat overlying the deeper tissues (it is difficult to do this cleanly). Begin your identification of structures on the lateral surface of the head. The parotid salivary gland lies mainly caudal to the masseter muscle, extending from the base of the ear dorsally, to the angle of the mandible ventrally. The parotid gland is likely to be incomplete in your abattoir sourced specimen. Note the parotid duct as it passes from the rostral margin of the parotid gland across the ventral aspect of the masseter towards the cheek. The mandibular salivary gland in the sheep is larger than the parotid and lies medial to it and the ramus of the mandible. Its duct runs below the oral mucosa on the floor of the oral cavity, to open at the sublingual caruncle (see later). Note the lymph nodes (mandibular and parotid) that lie close to these salivary glands. The dorsal and ventral buccal salivary glands occupy the cheek, level with the upper and lower cheek teeth – only parts of these glands will be visible at this stage. The buccinator is the muscle that acts to return food from the vestibule (space between the cheek and the teeth) to between the teeth for chewing. It covers the buccal region between the maxilla and mandible, from the angle of the lips to the ramus of the mandible. The muscles of mastication include the masseter, that lies on the lateral surface of the ramus of the mandible, ventral to the zygomatic arch, and the temporalis, that occupies the temporal fossa and lies dorsal and medial to the zygomatic arch and rostral and medial to the pinna of the ear. Now turn to the medial cut surface of your specimen. Identify the following structures: Tongue - The frenulum, body, root, apex and torus. - The papillae – which types can you find? - The intrinsic muscle of the tongue (The medial aspect of some of the extrinsic muscles of the tongue may be observed, but these muscles will be more clearly shown in the dog demonstration dissection). Note the transected basihyoid bone in the muscle of the root of the tongue – this is one of the bones of the hyoid apparatus (individual bones of the hyoid will be covered in the respiratory course and need not be explored here). The extrinsic and intrinsic muscles of the tongue act to move and shape the tongue during prehension, chewing and swallowing of food. The sublingual caruncles in the sheep lie on the floor of the mouth, rostral to the frenulum and caudal to the lower incisors. Which salivary gland ducts open here? Dental pad Buccal papillae Hard palate and soft palate The pharynx - this has three parts: - The oropharynx is the space ventral to the soft palate that extends from the palatoglossal arches to the base of the epiglottis. - The nasophaynx is the space dorsal to the palate that extends from the choanae (internal nostrils) to level with the caudal margin of the soft palate at the palatopharyngeal arches. - The laryngopharynx extends from level with the caudal margin of the soft palate to the entrance to the oesophagus (the pharyngeal muscles that assist with movement of food into the oesophagus will be indicated in the demonstration dog dissection). The larynx lies ventral to the laryngopharynx and entrance to the oesophagus. (The individual components of the larynx will be covered in your respiratory course and their identification, except for the epiglottis, is not required here). Now turn to the ventral aspect of the head. The thin mylohyoideus muscle is the most ventral muscle, with transverse fibres that originate on the medial aspect of the mandible. The thicker straplike muscle dorsal to it is the geniohyoideus. These muscles act to move the hyoid and tongue to facilitate prehension and swallowing. Dissection: Incise the mylohyoideus along its attachment to the mandible. This will expose the digastricus muscle that runs medial to the ramus to insert on the medial and ventral aspects of the body of the mandible. This muscle originates on the occipital bone of the skull and it acts to open the mouth. You will also see the ventral part of the pterygoid muscle attached to the medial surface of the ramus of the mandible, deep to the digastricus. The pterygoid, masseter and temporalis muscles act together to elevate and (in herbivores) rotate the jaw during mastication. Dissection: Make a longitudinal incision through the mylohyoideus, parallel to the mandible, to expose the sublingual salivary gland. You may notice one or more large nerves in this region that innnervate the tongue. 2 . D O G D E M O N S T R A T I O N D I S S E C T I O N This specimen has been prepared so that you can examine an intact larynx and pharynx in situ. The salivary glands have been reflected or removed, the digastricus muscle excised, the mandibular symphysis separated and tissues attached to the medial surface of the mandible reflected. Identify the mylohyoideus and geniohyoideus muscles. The extrinsic muscles of the tongue that originate on the hyoid and the mandible and insert onto the tongue may be seen in this preparation (it is not necessary to name them individually here - that will be covered in a subsequent course). At its cranial end the oesophagus lies dorsal to the trachea. The pharyngeal muscles are intact in this specimen. Insert a finger into the entrance of the oesophagus by passing your hand over the dorsal aspect of the tongue. Your fingers are now within the pharyngeal muscles that are rostral to the oesophageal entrance. You will also be able to feel some of the delicate bones of the hyoid apparatus on either side of this arch of muscles and the cartilages of the larynx ventrally. 3 . C O M P A R A T I V E T O N G U E S A number of tongues from different species will be available for examination. Determine the species from which each tongue was taken. Identify and examine the following features: shape, dorsum, apex, body, frenulum, torus linguae and hyoid bones if present. Identify and examine the papillae in respect to types and distribution in each species. What are their functions? From R. Nickel, A. Schummer and E. Seiferle.
