These are Polyhedral shaped cells, with a centrally placed spherical nucleus with prominent nucleoli. Mitochondria and other organelles are abundant; the cytoplasm varies with the functional state of cell, eg foamy or vacuolated appearance due to presence of glycogen and lipid inclusions. These cells carry out most of the functions listed above. Veterinary Bioscience 1: Metabolism 2 Specialised blood channels little bigger than capillaries, called sinusoids, extend between cords of liver cells: These are lined by endothelial cells and Kupffer cells. The latter are phagocytic cells (macrophages) that are extremely efficient at removing micro-particles and abnormal macromolecules and old red blood cells from the sinusoidal blood. This is one function that the hepatocytes are not able to do. Stellate cells – are pericytes, found around the sinusoids just under the endothelium, and The Liver is defined into 3 lobules based on structural or functional concepts: 1. Hepatic or classical lobule o The basic structural unit of the liver. In cross-section it is somewhat hexagonal in shape. o The Central vein (hepatic vein) is present in the centre of the lobule o The Bile duct, hepatic artery and portal vein - known collectively as the portal triad - are at the periphery of the lobule in 3 to 4 of the 6 corners of the hexagon o Lymphatic vessels are also present in the portal triad area o Hepatic cords extend outwards in a radial pattern from the central vein. These are formed by hepatocytes (= liver cells) o Specialised blood capillaries - sinusoids extend between the liver cell cords: These are lined by endothelial cells and Kupffer cells. The latter are phagocytic cells that are extremely efficient at removing micro-particles and abnormal macromolecules from the sinusoidal blood. o Sinusoidal blood flows in a centripetal direction - toward the central vein 3 2. Portal lobule o Defined as a functional secretory unit of the liver - the drainage of bile o An important component of bile is bile salts - function to emulsify fats in the small intestine - resulting in micelle formation - to facilitate lipid absorption and activate intestinal lipases o The portal lobule is triangular in shape – it is formed by parts of 3 adjacent classical lobules adjoining a portal canal with the bile duct as its central axis. o Its boundary is defined by drawing lines between the central veins of 3 adjacent classical lobules Junqueira and Carneiro, Basic Histology, a text and atlas 4 o Portal lobule Liver acinus 3. Liver acinus o Defined as a functional unit of the liver - the supply of blood to liver tissue. o Is diamond-shaped, formed by the contiguous parts of 2 adjacent classical lobules o The boundary is defined by drawing lines between 2 adjacent central veins, via their common portal triads Structure and function of the bile ducts and gall bladder Bile Duct System (biliary system = liver + gall bladder) Between the hepatocytes are very fine channels - bile canaliculi. Bile flows in a centrifugal direction - toward the portal triads. These open into larger ductules that, by successive unions within the connective tissue between the lobules, ultimately form a few large hepatic ducts. Before or shortly after leaving the liver at the porta these combine in a single trunk - the common hepatic duct. A tortuous side branch - the cystic duct - arises from the common trunk and leads to the pear-shaped gall bladder. The part of the common trunk that is distal to the origin of the cystic duct is known as the bile duct or common bile duct. It eventually runs to the duodenum, entering the dorsal or mesenteric border on the major duodenal papilla. Gall Bladder This pear shaped organ may be regarded as a diverticulum of the bile duct, enlarged to form a reservoir for the storage of bile, with its neck continued by the cystic duct. It stores bile during periods of digestive rest. The opening of the bile duct into duodenum guarded by Sphincter of Oddi, closed except during meals. Histologically, the mucosal wall of the gall bladder is lined by simple columnar epithelium, and mucosal crypts (small epithelial diverticulae) are evident. Below the mucosa is a loose connective tissue lamina propria / submucosa, then scant, thin bundles of muscularis externa and a serosal covering. The bile produced in liver is stored and concentrated in gall bladder (active transport of salts through mucosa followed osmotically by water). 5 Emptying of the gall bladder occurs in response to food in the duodenum. This causes rhythmic contraction of walls of gall bladder, simultaneous relaxation of Sphincter of Oddi and peristalsis in duodenum aids sphincter relaxation. Mediators of gall bladder emptying: o cholecystokinin (released in response to fat in duodenum) causes contraction of gall bladder and relaxation of sphincter. o The muscle in the gall bladder wall and duct, including the sphincter at the entrance to the duodenum is supplied by parasympathetic nerves. Vagal stimulation is therefore also a stimulus to gall bladder emptying (although weaker than that caused by cholecystokinin). NB: horse, rat, elephant, some deer lack gall bladder. In these species without gall bladder, they are able to upregulate production of bile in response to demand. Bile Bile consists of: o An aqueous alkaline fluid (similar to pancreatic NaHCO3 secretion) = added by duct cells o Plus organic constituents = from hepatocyte activity: - bile salts - cholesterol - lecithin - bilirubin Bile primarily functions in the absorption and digestion of fat. Bile salts are derivatives of cholesterol, and are synthesized by hepatocytes from cholesterol and then conjugated with one or other of two amino acids, taurine and glycine. This conjugation step makes molecule highly polar - the steroid backbone is lipophilic, and favours interaction with other lipophilic molecules; while the amino acid conjugate is hydrophilic and favours interaction with water. Conjugated bile salts are thus able to function as detergents, and serve to keep fats in solution in an aqueous environment. Fats are then accessible to lipase. (See earlier Digestive System lectures). Bile salts secreted by hepatocytes come from two sources: newly formed bile salts synthesized in hepatocytes from cholesterol, and also bile salts that come to the liver in the portal vein, following their reabsorption in the ileum. Cholesterol Considerable amounts of cholesterol in bile. Bile salts keep cholesterol in solution, thus allowing cholesterol to be excreted in bile in much higher concentrations than would otherwise be possible. Bile pigments Formed mainly from the breakdown of the haem portion of haemoglobin. Effete red blood cells are engulfed and broken down by macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system (in tissues such as the spleen and liver), and the haem moiety is converted to biliverdin and then bilirubin. Bilirubin, bound to albumin in the plasma, is taken up by a specific carrier mechanism into hepatocytes, conjugated with glucuronic acid, then transported into the bile by a specific carrier mechanism. Bilirubin is yellow and contributes to the colour of bile. If circulating bilirubin levels build up too much, connective tissue becomes stained - causes jaundice. Bilirubin also functions as an important antioxidant (oxidised to biliverdin by oxygen free radicals – then reconverted in the liver to bilirubin by the enzyme biliverdin reductase). 6 Bilirubin may be deconjugated and converted by bacteria in the intestine, to urobilinogen. This is then converted to stercobilinogen, and oxidised to stercobilin which is excreted in faeces. Stercobilin is largely responsible for giving faeces its dark brown colour. (Although most of the urobilinogen is converted and excreted in the faeces, some is reabsorbed and goes through the liver again and a small amount is excreted in the urine). Enterohepatic circulation Bile salts: 95-98% of secreted bile salts are reabsorbed by the intestine (some of which are converted by bacteria into secondary or unconjugated forms). Venous blood from the ileum goes straight into the portal vein and then into the liver sinusoids. There, hepatocytes extract bile acids very efficiently. The net effect of enterohepatic recirculation is that each bile salt molecule may be re-used many times, even during a single digestive phase. The small loss of bile salts into the colon may help in colonic water absorption, by interacting with lipids in the apical cell membrane of colonic absorptive cells. Other compounds, e.g. vitamins, drugs etc. also secreted in bile and absorbed and returned via portal circulation to liver. Further reading: Banks: Applied Veterinary Histology 2nd edition 1986.
