Kupffer cells • Macrophages • Lining sinusoids • Phagocytosis of debris, old RBCs (not a function of the hepatocyte) Parenchyma units described in 3 ways: • Classical lobule • Portal lobule • Liver acinus • Based on structural or functional concepts Hepatic or Classical Lobule • Basic structural unit of the liver • Hexagonal in shape • Central vein at centre of hexagon • Portal triads at periphery of hexagon – Portal vein – Hepatic artery – Bile duct Branch of hepatic v. Central vein Hepatic a. Bile duct Portal v. X X Hepatic a. Bile duct Portal v. Portal triad Central v. Hepatic or classical liver lobules X XClassical lobule • Cords of hepatocytes radiate from the central vein • Sinusoids* extend between the cords of hepatocytes – Lined by endothelial cells – Kupffer cells - phagocytic cells – Blood flows in a centripetal direction - to central vein *Sinusoids: tiny endothelium-lined passages for blood flow through tissues Hepatic or classical liver lobules Hepatic a.
