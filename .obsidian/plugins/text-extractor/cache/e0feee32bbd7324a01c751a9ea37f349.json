These are named the innate and the adaptive responses, although in practice there is much interaction between them. The term innate immunity is sometimes used to include physical, chemical, and microbiological barriers, but more usually encompasses the elements of the immune system (neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, complement, cytokines, and acute phase proteins) which provide immediate host defence. The highly conserved nature of the response, which is seen in even the simplest animals, confirms its importance in survival.1 Adaptive immunity is the hallmark of the immune system of higher animals. This response consists of antigen-specific reactions through T lymphoctyes and B lymphocytes. Whereas the innate response is rapid but sometimes damages normal tissues through lack of specificity, the adaptive response is precise, but takes several days or weeks to develop. The adaptive response has memory, so that subsequent exposure leads to a more vigorous and rapid response, but this is not immediate.2,3 The innate response Neutrophil recruitment A central feature of the innate reaction is recruitment and activation of neutrophils at the site of infection to eradicate pathogens. 4 The same process occurring inappropriately leads to the inflammation of connective tissue diseases, vasculitis, and the systemic inflammatory response syndrome. There is intense interest in the mechanisms underlying the process for the development of new anti- inflammatory therapies. 5,6 During the very early stages of infection or tissue damage, there is release of cytokines from activated macrophages. Two of these, granulocyte and granulocyte- macrophage colony stimulating factors, stimulate division of myeloid precursors in the bone marrow, releasing millions of cells into the circulation and causing a characteristic neutrophil leucocytosis. Neutrophils, like most cells involved in immune responses, are not static Lancet 2001; 357: 1777–89 Departments of Immunology (J Parkin PhD) and Medical and Dental Education (B Cohen BSc), St Bartholomew’s and the Royal London Hospital School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary and Westfield College, West Smithfield, London EC1A 7BE, UK Correspondence to: Dr Jackie Parkin (e-mail: Jackie.Parkin@bartsandthelondon.nhs.uk) within a particular compartment, but are mobile cells that travel round the body. They normally flow freely in the blood as the circulating pool, or roll along the vascular endothelium as the marginating pool. To home to a site of infection, neutrophils use a multistep process involving proinflammatory mediators, adhesion molecules, chemoattractants, and chemokines. Although most work was initially done within the neutrophil system, it is now clear that all leucocytes, including lymphocytes, use this mechanism of localisation.7 The recruited neutrophils phagocytose organsisms by making pseudopodia (projections of cytoplasmic membrane) which form a membrane-bound vesicle (phagosome) around the particle. This fuses with neutrophil cytoplasmic granules to form the phagolysosome. In this protected compartment killing of the organism occurs by a combination of two mechanisms. The oxygen-dependent response or respiratory burst, involves the sequential reduction of oxygen by an NADPH oxidase leading to production of toxic oxygen metabolites, such as hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radicals, and singlet oxygen. The oxygen-independent response, uses the highly toxic cationic proteins and enzymes (eg, myeloperoxidase and lyzozyme) contained within the neutrophil cytoplasmic granules. 8 Ingestion and killing of organisms is 100-fold more effective if the particle is first opsonised with specific antibody or complement (C’). These molecules bind to neutrophil Fc and C’ receptors, increasing adhesion between particle and phagocyte and priming the cell for activation. Some encapsulated organisms, such as pneumococcus and haemophilus are not susceptible to neutrophil phagocytosis unless first coated with antibody. This explains why individuals with antibody deficiency are so susceptible to this type of infection, despite normal neutrophil numbers and function. Complement The complement system has several important functions in innate immunity and consists of at least 20 serum glycoproteins, some being regulatory. These are activated in a cascade sequence, with amplification stages. This means that activation of a single molecule will lead to thousands of molecules being generated. There are three pathways of complement activation that can be driven by the presence of a foreign substance (figure 1), the classical by antigen-antibody reactions, the alternative by polysaccharides from yeasts, and gram negative bacteria. The more recently identified mannan binding lectin pathway 9 feeds into the classical sequence by activating it An overview of the immune system Jacqueline Parkin, Bryony Cohen Immunology We are continually exposed to organisms that are inhaled, swallowed, or inhabit our skin and mucous membranes. Whether these organisms penetrate and cause disease is a result of both the pathogenicity of the organism (the virulence factors at its disposal) and the integrity of host defence mechanisms. The immune system is an interactive network of lymphoid organs, cells, humoral factors, and cytokines. The essential function of the immune system in host defence is best illustrated when it goes wrong; underactivity resulting in the severe infections and tumours of immunodeficiency, overactivity in allergic and autoimmune disease. In this review we have covered the normal function of the immune system in recognising, repelling, and eradicating pathogens and other foreign molecules.
