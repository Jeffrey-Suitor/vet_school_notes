LECTURE 1 – WHY HAVE A CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM? I NT R OD UC T I ON The primary function of the cardiovascular system is to facilitate rapid transport of critical molecules such as oxygen and glucose to body cells, and to remove waste products such as carbon dioxide and urea. All cells must exchange materials with their environment in order to achieve homeostasis, a fundamental requirement for maintenance of life. This body system also Laura graduated as a veterinarian from the University of Melbourne in 2007. She then worked in small animal private veterinary practice in Australia and the United Kingdom for 7 years. She subsequently completed her PhD in cardiovascular pharmacology, and a Graduate Certificate in University Teaching at the University of Melbourne. She is now a Senior Lecturer at the Melbourne Veterinary School, and teaches into the Bachelor of Science program as well as the first and second years of the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine program. She engages in educational research, and has a special interest in student support, curriculum development, and collaborative learning. plays a role in control of body processes through the transport of hormones, and in thermoregulation by regulating the distribution of heat from the body core to the periphery. The main components of the cardiovascular system are: − Muscular heart - a pump that contracts and propels blood around the body − Arterial system - conveys blood from the heart to the capillaries − Venous system -conducts blood from the capillaries back to the heart − Microcirculation – the site of exchange The cardiovascular system requires a pump and tubes to circulate fluid in the body. The heart rhythmically contracts to pump blood into large arteries. Large arteries split into branches with smaller diameters and thinner walls than the parent vessel, but with every branching, the total diameter of the resulting vessels increases. B OD Y F L U I D C OM P A R T M E NT S A ND MO VE M E N T A C RO SS C A P I LLA RY WA L L S The body fluids are located in two main compartments; the intracellular fluid (approx. 2/3 of total body water) and the extracellular compartment (approx. 1/3 of total body water) (See ‘Cells to Systems’ Lecture 7 for more detail). The extracellular fluid compartment is the link between the external environment and the intracellular fluid compartment. The extracellular fluid compartment includes the blood plasma circulating within the cardiovascular system (approx. ¼ of extracellular fluid), and the interstitial fluid surrounding cells. Most substances cross capillary walls by passive diffusion. Five factors determine diffusion rate: (i) concentration difference, (ii) surface area for exchange, (iii) diffusion distance, (iv) molecular weight of the substance and (v) permeability of the wall to the diffusing substance. The distance factor is very important, hence capillaries are designed to facilitate rapid diffusion by having a very thin wall, and a large cross-sectional area (located as close as possible to every cell in the body). TR A N S C A P I LLA RY FLU I D M O V E M E N T Water filled channels permit fluid flow through the capillary wall. This is called bulk flow because various constituents move together in bulk, not as discrete diffusion of individual solutes. Fluid is constantly moving into and out of capillaries – the net fluid movement out of capillaries is referred to as filtration, and net fluid movement into capillaries is called reabsorption. Net flow occurs because of differences between the hydrostatic and colloid osmotic pressure between plasma and interstitial fluid. Four forces influence fluid movement across the capillary wall: − capillary blood pressure (Pc) − plasma colloid osmotic pressure (oncotic pressure; πp) − interstitial fluid hydrostatic pressure (PIF) − interstitial fluid colloid osmotic pressure (πIF) The net fluid movement at a given point across a capillary wall is given by Starling’s hypothesis, using the equation: 𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 𝑁𝑁𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒ℎ𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑁𝑁 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑁𝑁𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑁𝑁 = 𝑜𝑜𝑝𝑝𝑁𝑁𝑜𝑜𝑎𝑎𝑝𝑝𝑜𝑜 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑁𝑁𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑁𝑁 − 𝑖𝑖𝑎𝑎𝑜𝑜𝑎𝑎𝑝𝑝𝑜𝑜 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑁𝑁𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑁𝑁 = [𝑃𝑃𝑐𝑐 + 𝜋𝜋𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼] − �𝜋𝜋𝑝𝑝 + 𝑃𝑃𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼� Capillary blood pressure gradually decreases along the length of the capillary, so the amount of fluid filtered out decreases in the first half of the capillary length, and then increasing amounts are reabsorbed in the second half. There is a slight predominance of filtration over reabsorption overall, so not all of the fluid volume leaving the capillaries into the interstitial fluid returns directly to the capillaries. The remainder must be returned via the lymphatic system. The volume of fluid transported through the lymphatics in 24 h is approximately equal to the animal’s total plasma volume. Fluid and protein enters porous blind-ending lymphatic capillaries and flow into larger lymphatic vessels back to the heart. M A K I NG B L OOD F L OW Flow of liquid through a tube occurs when there is a pressure difference between inlet and outlet ends of a tube. Pressure difference is the driving force for the flow. Because friction develops between moving fluid and the stationary walls of the tube, vessels tend to resist fluid movement in them. Vascular resistance is a measure of how difficult it is to make blood flow through a tube, i.e. the pressure required to move a given volume over a certain period of time.

D E T E R M I N A N TS O F R E S I ST A N C E Poiseuille’s Law states that: 𝑅𝑅𝑁𝑁𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖𝑝𝑝𝑁𝑁𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑒𝑒𝑁𝑁 𝑁𝑁𝑜𝑜 𝐷𝐷𝐹𝐹𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 𝑖𝑖𝑎𝑎 𝑎𝑎 𝑁𝑁𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡𝑁𝑁 = 8 × 𝑣𝑣𝑖𝑖𝑝𝑝𝑒𝑒𝑜𝑜𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖𝑁𝑁𝑣𝑣 (𝑉𝑉) × 𝐹𝐹𝑁𝑁𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑁𝑁ℎ 𝑜𝑜𝐷𝐷 𝑁𝑁𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡𝑁𝑁 (𝐿𝐿) 𝜋𝜋 × 𝑖𝑖𝑎𝑎𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑝𝑝𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝐹𝐹 𝑝𝑝𝑎𝑎𝑜𝑜𝑖𝑖𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 (𝑝𝑝)4 𝑜𝑜𝐷𝐷 𝑁𝑁𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡𝑁𝑁 Combining these in the basic flow equation: 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 𝑝𝑝𝑎𝑎𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 (𝑄𝑄) = ∆𝑃𝑃𝜋𝜋𝑝𝑝4 8𝐿𝐿𝑉𝑉 Therefore, blood flow depends on: − Pressure difference – gradient of pressure across the vessels − Total peripheral resistance – small changes in internal radius have a powerful effect on flow. When the radius (or diameter) of a blood vessel doubles, the flow increases by 16 fold! (r 4). − Viscosity – this is not a variable that is easily changed, but it may influence vascular resistance. N E T W O R K S O F VE SS E LS Vessels in series: Considering the cardiovascular system as a whole, different types and sizes of vessels are arranged sequentially, in series. In a closed system, blood flow (volume per unit time) must be equal in each segment. However, pressure will decrease along the network, with a portion of the overall pressure drop occurring within each component element. The largest portion of the overall pressure drop will occur in the part having the greatest resistance to flow. This occurs in the arterioles (tiny arteries feeding into the capillary beds). Vessels in parallel: Since each organ or region of the body has its own arteries (branching off the aorta), vascular beds are therefore arranged in parallel. This also applies within each organ vascular bed as well – i.e. capillary beds have many individual capillary vessels arranged in parallel. Ohm’s Law defines resistance for parallel networks as: 1 𝑅𝑅𝑝𝑝 = 1 𝑅𝑅1 + 1 𝑅𝑅2 + 1 𝑅𝑅3 … 𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑒𝑒 Therefore, total flow: (𝑄𝑄 𝑁𝑁𝑜𝑜𝑁𝑁𝑎𝑎𝐹𝐹) = ∆𝑃𝑃 𝑅𝑅𝑝𝑝 This means that the overall resistance for any parallel network will always be less than the resistance of any of the elements of the network. Also, blood flow to a particular organ can be altered (by adjusting the resistance of the arterioles) without greatly affecting pressures and flows in other organs. T H E P UM P I NG S Y S T E M The pumping action of the heart as it contracts maintains the pressure difference that enables blood flow to occur. The mammalian heart is a double pump - the left and right sides of the heart function as pumps \"in series\" for separate circulations (the dual circulation): a) Systemic Circulation - high pressure/high resistance b) Pulmonary Circulation - low pressure/low resistance Each pump consists of a ventricle – a closed chamber surrounded by a thick muscle wall. It has valves designed to allow flow in only one direction. Contraction of cardiac muscle increases the pressure within the ventricle, causing the blood to flow from the heart to the blood vessels – this is called systole. When the ventricular muscle relaxes, pressure within the ventricle falls below that in the atrium, the AV valve opens and the ventricle fills with blood. This is called diastole. Three features of the heart are very important for effective functioning: conductivity, contractility and autorhythmicity. These features are a characteristic of all cardiac muscle cells. However, the coordination of activity of all cardiac muscle cells is possible because these cells are electrically connected by gap junctions, and also muscle cells in certain areas are specifically adapted to control the frequency of excitation, pathway of conduction and rate of impulse propagation through various parts of the heart.
