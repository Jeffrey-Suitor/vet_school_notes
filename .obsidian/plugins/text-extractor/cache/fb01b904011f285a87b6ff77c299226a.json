Variations in blood flow and perfusion A local increase in blood flow within a tissue Hyperaemia Congestionand Hyperaemia – active • Increased blood going into tissue • Red-oxygenated blood Congestion – passive • Outflow of blood reduced • Reddish-blue - not oxygenated blood Hyperaemia Congestionand Hyperaemia Appearance • Red colour- oxygenated blood • Warm to touch Physiologic • Digestion • Exercise • Dissipate heat • Neurovascular (blushing) https://www.studyblue.com/notes/note/n/i mages-blood-conditions/deck/17056411 https://experiencelife.com Hyperaemia Stomach Pathological Riley Cliniciansbrief.com Hyperaemia Pathological Parvoviral enteritis Normal Hyperaemia http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0100-736X2018000100113 Congestion • Passive engorgement of blood vessels • Decreased blood outflow Appearance • Dark red to blue/black colour- poorly oxygenated blood • Cooler than normal • Swollen http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8BPDw9MB2I Congestion Vein Artery • Thin-walled • Easily obstructed • Thick-walled • More difficult to obstruct Rectal and vaginal prolapse Photo from: @lhotse09 Instagram Congestion Gross • Dark red to blue/black – depending on degree of stagnation • Cut surface ooze blood and often wet Congestion Two factors determine the severity and consequence of congestion 1. Duration a) Acute (sudden) b) Chronic (long term) 2. Extent a) Localised – a discrete area is affected b) Generalised – a systemic change CongestionConsequences of congestion in the live animal Acute • Engorged capillaries • Oedema Chronic • Hypoxia – reduced O2 • Degeneration/necrosis Localised Congestion Congestion of segments of intestine as in torsion Generalized Congestion Dependent congestion / hypostatic congestion http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-21/dead-cows-hit-with-bovine-anaemia/7858594 Hypostatic Congestion A white poodle dog presented to your clinic with ear infection.
