Growth Av. Requirement Hay, Silage and Straw Dairy farmers may conserve feed or buy it Hay – dried pasture Silage – fermented pasture (in airtight storage) Straw – dried (mostly cereal) crop after harvest • Hay needs to be dried down to 15% moisture or less • Hay making process Mow paddock when there is plenty of grass Dry, Rake, Bale It needs to be dry enough! • Costs can vary depending on scale • Starts at about $50 per tonne for the whole process. • Grass, Legume or Cereal base • Energy and protein vary – need to FEEDTEST it Hay makingSilage Making Process • Forage mown / cut • Allowed to dry quickly (60-70% Dry Matter) • Baled and wrapped, or chopped and stacked • Bacteria convert Water Soluble Carbohydrates to fermentation acids, ideally lactic acid. • Needs to happen quickly to rapidly lower the pH • Some plants make better silage than others Grass Grass grows in proportion to photosynthetic area To grow the most, let it grow the fastest Rotational Grazing • Put cows onto pasture at about 12cm (2400kgDM/ha) • Take them out at ~4cm (1200kgDM/HA) • “Pasture Wedge” If we base the decision to put a cow in a paddock on pasture height, then the time between consecutive grazings of a single paddock will depend on the grass growth rate 7 Grass In Warrnambool, grass growth rates vary with the season Farmers can • measure growth rates • use historical data • Use data from local demonstration farms 8 Rotational Grazing Rotation length = (“In” - “Out”) ÷ Growth Rate If pasture growing @ 35 kgDM/ha/day (2400 - 1200) ÷ 35 = 37 days Therefore, the paddock size should be 1/37th of the farm If pasture growing @ 80 kgDM/ha/day (2400 - 1200) ÷ 80 = 16 days Therefore, the paddock size should be 1/16th of the farm 9 Practical Grazing Management 1. Decide desired production level of cows 2. Work out required intake 3. Use growth rates to work out rotation length 4. Work out % of area to be grazed daily 5. Calculate KgDM/Cow from grass 6. Balance ration with supplements Rule of Thumb: Most diets average 10MJ KG/DM Cows require 5MJ to produce 1 L milk and 60MJ for maintenance Cows need ½ Litres + 6 KG DM per day Practical Grazing Management - example 11 Say 200Ha farm, 400 cows producing 30 litres per day, Growth rate = 30KgDM/Ha 1. Calculate Intake required (KgDM/day) • Half the litres + 6 = 21kgDM 2. Use Growth rate to calculate rotation length • 40 days (1200/30) 3. Work out % of farm • 40 day rotation = 200ha/40 days = 5Ha/day (=2.5% farm) 4. Work out DM intake from Grass • 5ha @ 1200KgDM/ha = 6000Kg pasture for 400 cows • 6000/400 = 15kg each, but they need 21kg 5. Calculate Supplements • Need 6kg supplements – Silage, Hay, Concentrates • Calculate protein, fibre, energy requirements given 15kg grass fed … Concentrates 12 Often fed in the dairy Cows can eat 10kg grain without a drink Many different feedstuffs available Protein, Energy, Fibre, trace elements can be “balanced” https://www.rumen8.com.au/ AEPS – DAIRY WEEK 1 13","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
