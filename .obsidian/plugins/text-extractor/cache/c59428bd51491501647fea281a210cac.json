It is spread across two campuses, Parkville and Werribee with the first two years predominantly at Parkville and final two years predominantly at Werribee. If you have concerns about your studies at any time, there are many people you can talk to for support and advice. This session will outline the best way to decide who to approach and how to contact staff if you need to. Overview of the Veterinary Professional Practice (VPP) subjects and Introduction to the Veterinary Profession There are professional practice subjects in every year of the DVM. They focus on ensuring that you are able to translate the academic and technical knowledge from the course into performing clinical tasks in a professional manner which meets the expectations of clients, employers and gives you a fulfilling career. Skills developed through the VPP subjects Non-technical skills • communication • self-awareness and wellbeing • ethics • animal welfare • personal and business financial management • development of professional identity Practical experience • working in a group (all years) • animal handling (DVM1) • dissections (DVM2) • clinical examinations (DVM2) • clinical skills (DVM3) • clinical rotations (DVM4) Introduction to the Veterinary Profession (VETS90122)/ Introduction to Professional Practice (VETS30030) The cohorts will have the same curriculum. VETS90122 (i.e. graduate cohort) has completion of the library task as a hurdle, which VETS30030 does not.
