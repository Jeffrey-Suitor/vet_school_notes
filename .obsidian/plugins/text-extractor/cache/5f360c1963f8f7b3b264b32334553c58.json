Inner parietal pericardium – 2. Outer fibrous pericardium • Pericardial cavity – Occupied by thin film of serous fluid - lubricant Dyce, Sack and Wensing. 2002. Textbook of Veterinary Anatomy. Functions of the pericardium • Protective • Help maintain position • Minimise friction during cardiac cycle • Prevent over-distension of the heart? 10 Pericarditis (cow) Pericardial effusion (horse) 1112 External features of the heart • Base - thin-walled atria • Coronary groove: – Demarcates atria from ventricles – Contains the main coronary vessels - often concealed by fat 13 External features of the heart • Atrium has a ‘free appendage’ - the auricle • Right and left auricles curve around the origin of the pulmonary trunk • Right auricle – most cranial part of the heart 14 External features of the heart • Thicker walled right and left ventricles form a firm cone • Position of the interventricular septum is marked by: – Left interventricular groove – Right interventricular groove – Apex - tip of the cone - part of left ventricle 1516 External features of the heart • Left lateral surface of the heart – Left atrium and left ventricle – Right ventricle and right auricle extend around the cranial border • Right lateral surface of the heart – Right atrium and right ventricle – Left ventricle and left atrium extend around the caudal border Dyce 17 External features of the heart • Right ventricle lies as much cranially as to the right of the left ventricle • Cranial border of right ventricle is convex • Caudal border of left ventricle – Carnivores - slightly convex – Horse - almost straight – Ruminants - slightly concave 18 Internal features of the heart • Right atrium – Four main openings • Cranial vena cava • Caudal vena cava • Coronary sinus • Right atrio-ventricular opening – Other variable openings • Small coronary veins • Azygous vein (in some species) Dyce 19 Internal features of the heart • Right atrium - surface is smooth • Right auricle - surface is interlaced with pectinate muscles • Vestiges of the fetal circulation – Fossa ovalis – Intervenous tubercle 2021 Internal features of the heart • Right ventricle – Lumen - crescent-shaped – Opening - guarded by the tricuspid valve • Three thin flap-like cusps • Free edge of cusp - restrained by chordae tendineae • Chordae tendineae arise from papillary muscles Dyce 22 Under normal circumstances, the interventricular septum, which divides the ventricles, contracts as part of the LV. 23 Internal features of the heart • Right Ventricular cavity – Crossed by the right septomarginal trabeculae – Irregular surface - presence of trabeculae carneae – Three papillary muscles: • Two from septum • Large one from the outer wall 24 Internal features of the heart • Right ventricular cavity - – Out-flow channel • Funnel-shaped ‘conus arteriosus’ • Directs blood into the pulmonary trunk • Smooth walls – Root of the pulmonary trunk - increased in diameter 25 Internal features of the heart • Pulmonary valve – 3 semi-lunar valvules - pockets – 3 bulges in the wall of the pulmonary trunk - sinuses of the pulmonary trunk – The pulmonary valve leaflets are much thinner structures than the aortic valve leaflets. 26 Internal features of the heart • Left atrium - openings: – Usually 6 pulmonary veins • 2 from the left • 4 from the right – Small coronary veins – Left A-V orifice into the left ventricle 27 Internal features of the heart • Left ventricle – Opening guarded by - mitral valve - • Has 2 cusps – Has 2 papillary muscles • Arise from the outer wall – Root of the aorta increased in diameter - aortic bulb 28 Chordae tendineae Opening to aorta Trabeculae carneae adipose R ventricle L atrium L ventricular myocardium Sheep heart 29 Internal features of the heart • Interventricular septum - 2 components – Thick muscular portion – Thin membranous portion • Site of closure of the embryonic interventricular foramen 30 Heart wall structure • Endocardium – Lines the lumen of the heart chambers • Myocardium – Is the thick middle layer of the heart – Is composed of cardiac muscle • Epicardium – External surface layer of the heart - also called the visceral pericardium 31 Internal features of the heart • Aortic valve - 3 semi-lunar valvules – Left coronary artery opens from left aortic sinus – Right coronary artery opens from right aortic sinus – Valvules of the left A-V and aortic valves - thicker than in the right ventricle 3233 The Cardiac Skeleton • Plate - 2 triangular areas - trigones • Reinforced by cartilage or bone: • Ox - 2 bones; Sheep - 1 bone (‘os cordis’) • Cat, Dog, Pig, Horse - cartilage 34 35 Heart position in the chestHeart position in the chest • In the horse, the heart is positioned almost vertically on the sternum, with the long-axis in a dorso-ventral direction.
