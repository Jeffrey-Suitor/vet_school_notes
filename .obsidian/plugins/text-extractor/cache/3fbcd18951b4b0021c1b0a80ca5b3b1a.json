Do not jump ahead. • This file gives you detailed instructions for completing each activity. Ask your tutor if you have any questions. • For some activities, you will be asked to record your answers to the questions by typing them into this file. You should save this PDF file each time you complete one of these questions, to make sure that your work does not get lost. Guidelines for effective Group work Your group will work at its best when everyone feels comfortable and “safe” to contribute to discussion. Here are a few suggestions that might help promote a safe and effective group work environment: • Ensure that you all know one another’s names- and that you use them during your conversations. • Effective listening is a key to effective group work. Respectful listening enhances a positive group dynamic, and creates a space where it is safe for all to contribute. • Taking time to discuss is really important- discussing involves questioning and responding, reviewing and reflecting, sharing understanding. This is where deep learning occurs. It can often be greatly enhanced by visualisation- by sharing of ideas, summaries and processes on your white board and by collective rephrasing and reframing of ideas. • Sharing of tasks and responsibilities is also important in group work. Perhaps make a roster and each week have a different group member take responsibility for the keyboard, and for completing your interactive pdf. 3 instructions Enter each group member’s name, Iand email address below.

GROUP NUMBER Name Email Address 4 triGGer You are working at Penfold’s Veterinary Clinic in the Tasmanian country town of Cascade. One morning Mrs. Daniels arrives with her 7 year old male, neutered Doberman pinscher, Jack. After greeting her and Jack, you usher them into your consultation room where Mrs. Daniels explains that Jack had refused to go on his normal walk this morning and he appears to be restless and distressed. She also noticed that he seemed to be having some trouble breathing and was coughing occasionally. 5 QUESTION 1 • List the key information about Jack below. Key information is all the information that may be relevant in assessing his current condition. • Identify Jack’s main problem and make a list of how it may be caused using a systematic approach. We will call each item on this list a hypothesis. For each hypothesis discuss how it may be causing the identified problem. • What further information, which might be obtained from questioning the owner, will help you decide between your hypotheses? Discuss your reasoning behind each question. 6 history Mrs. Daniels reports that Jack has always been a very active, bright dog, but in the last few months he has appeared to slow down a little at the end of his walks. This morning he seemed lethargic and showed no interest when Mrs. Daniels got out his collar and lead, whereas normally he would be dancing around at her feet to go out. It was at this time that Mrs. Daniels noticed that Jack seemed to be breathing more heavily than normal and had an occasional soft sounding cough. Jack has been eating and drinking normal amounts up to now. He usually eats dry dog food, although two days ago he was given an uncooked lamb shank bone as a treat. Mrs. Daniels has not seen any evidence of vomiting, but this morning he had some diarrhoea, which is unusual for him. He is up-to-date with his vaccinations and receives intestinal worming tablets every three months. He receives Proheart (heartworm prevention) injections annually. QUESTION 2 • Summarize the additional information obtained from the history. • Based upon this information refine your hypotheses – decide whether they are more likely, less likely or can be excluded. Provide an explanation for each change. Give a mechanism for any new hypothesis. • What further information that you can obtain from a physical examination may help you refine your hypotheses? 7 physical examination While you have been taking the history from Mrs Daniels, you have also been observing Jack. You notice that he appears quiet and depressed. He is standing in the room with his head lowered and his front legs spread slightly wide. Parameter Findings Normal range Body weight 37 kg Body condition score 3 1 = emaciated, 10 = obese Temperature 38.2 °C 38-39 °C Pulse Variable rate 120 - 200+ (hard to count accurately), weak and “thready” with pulse deficits. 80-120 impulses per minute Respiration 60 20-30 breaths per minute Capillary refill time 3 s ‹2 s Mucous membranes Pale Pink and moist Thoracic examination Heart rate varies between 120 and 260 (hard to count) beats per minute. There is a grade 2/6 systolic murmur present at the costochondral junction in the region of the 4-5th intercostal space on the left side. Lung sounds in the dorsal lung fields are harsh bilaterally with the occasional “crackle” auscultated. No abnormalities detected Abdominal examination NAD No abnormalities detected QUIZ 1 Click back to the LMS and attempt Quiz 1 before continuing. 8 QUESTION 3 • Summarize the additional information obtained from the physical examination. What organ systems are likely to be causing the clinical signs seen in Jack? • Based upon this information refine your hypotheses – decide whether they are more likely, less likely or can be excluded. Provide an explanation for each change. Give a mechanism for any new hypothesis. • What further tests could be performed to differentiate between these diagnoses? • What simple treatment could be initiated while you are organizing further diagnostic tests? 9 r adioGr aphy While organizing diagnostic testing your nurses insert nasal oxygen catheters and commence Jack on 3-4 litres per minute of humidified oxygen. You start off by performing radiographs (X-rays) of Jack’s chest and these are depicted below. There is also a lateral and ventrodorsal view of a normal Doberman chest to compare with the same views of Jack. Normal Doberman lateral chest radiograph Jack lateral chest radiograph Normal Doberman dorso-ventral chest radiograph Jack dorso-ventral chest radiograph 10 QUESTION 4 • What parameters are used to assess cardiac structure and function on a chest radiograph? Make a list of these. • Using these parameters as a guide, describe the differences in the cardiac shadow that you are able to see on Jack’s radiographs compared with the normal Doberman. How do you interpret these differences? • Now look at the lung fields. How do they compare with the lung fields of the normal dog radiograph? • Based on your findings on the chest radiographs and your observation of Jack’s clinical condition and presenting signs, can you now refine your hypothesis? • Draw on the white board a mechanism to explain his poor exercise tolerance and rapid respiratory rate. 11 r adioGr aphic interpretation Description The cardiac silhouette (outline) is enlarged in Jack’s radiographs compared to the normal Doberman with elevation of the trachea from its normal position as a result. The cardiomegaly is particularly pronounced on the left side of the heart as seen in the dorso- ventral view. There is an increased radio opacity (whiteness) in the dorsal hilar region (area where the trachea branches into the bronchi) of the lungs. The pulmonary veins are distended on Jack’s radiographs (hard to see on these images). Interpretation There is evidence of gross cardiomegaly on the radiographs, together with pulmonary venous distension and perihilar oedema. Given the breed, (Doberman) dilated cardiomyopathy is the most likely cause of these changes. There is evidence of predominantly left sided cardiac failure manifest in these radiographs as pulmonary oedema and pulmonary venous distension. Echocardiography to confirm this diagnosis is recommended. Based upon these radiographic findings you decide to perform a cardiac ultrasound on Jack. 12 echocardioGr aphy To perform echocardiography, Jack was placed on his right side (right lateral recumbency) and an ultrasound probe placed underneath him aiming upwards. Schematic long axis echocardiogram (left hand side diagram) Note that in this diagram the ultrasound probe appears to be placed from above the heart, whereas in reality it is placed beneath the heart (when the dog is lying on its right side). The following image is a long axis view from a normal dog. Normal long axis echocardiogram (left hand side) The ultrasound probe is by convention placed at the top of the screen. The left ventricle (LV) and left atrium (LA) are marked. The right ventricle and right atrium are less distinct at the top of the screen. The following image is Jack’s long axis view. Jack’s long axis echocardiogram (left hand side) The left ventricle (LV) and left atrium (LA) are marked. 13 Colour Doppler was applied to the area around the mitral valve (arrows), in order to locate the origin of the murmur auscultated Echocardiogram showing turbulent flow Turbulent flow can be seen in this view in the left atrium during systole (coloured areas on left hand side), when the mitral valve is normally closed and no blood should be passing through it. This ultrasound shows that the mitral valve is leaking in systole resulting in the heart murmur that can be heard on auscultation of Jack’s chest. Having completed the long axis study, a short axis study is performed. In this view the ultrasound probe is rotated through 90 degrees at the level of the papillary muscles and allows us to look at the function of the left ventricle in particular. Below is shown a M-mode view of a normal canine heart. This measures the movement and thickness of the ventricular walls and the chambers (Y-axis) over time (X-axis). Systole (contraction) is when the two walls are closest to each other, diastole (relaxation) is when they are further away. Normal M-mode echocardiogram on the left hand side Captions show left ventricular internal diameter (LVID) at diastole and systole. Note that the M-mode view depicts the movement and thickness of the left ventricular wall over time. Jack’s M-mode echocardiogram 14 QUESTION 5 • Compare the long axis view of a normal dog with that of Jack. What differences are apparent? • Compare the M-mode view of a normal dog with Jack. What differences are apparent and how do you interpret them? • The measurements that we make in the M-mode view allow us to calculate the fractional shortening (FS) using the formula: FS = LVID at diastole - LVID at systole / LVID at diastole X 100%. Fractional shortening is a measure of how much the ventricular chamber contracts with each heart beat. Normal fractional shortening is 28-40%. Jack’s values for LVID at diastole = 4.6cm and LVID systole = 3.9cm. What is Jack’s fractional shortening. What effect will this have on the pumping effectiveness of Jack’s heart? 15 interpretation of the echocardioGr am The long axis view of Jack’s heart compared with a normal heart shows enlargement (dilation) of the left ventricular chamber together with a reduction in the thickness of the left ventricular wall. Although not apparent in these images, the left atrium was also found to be enlarged when measured. The M-mode view of Jack’s heart compared with a normal heart shows a reduction in the thickness of the ventricular wall, a reduction in the amount of contraction of the ventricular chamber during systole and an increase in the size of the left ventricular chamber at the end of systole. The fractional shortening was calculated at 15%. Based on the reduced fractional shortening, the increase in the left ventricle diameter in systole and the subjective increase in size of all four chambers, a diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy was made. electrocardioGr aphy An ecg represents the electrical events occurring within the heart - the P wave represents atrial depolarization and the QRS complex reflects (left) ventricular depolarization. 16 In view of Jack’s abnormal heart rhythm noted on his physical examination, you decide to perform an electrocardiogram (ecg) on him. The illustration below shows part of the trace you recorded. The first two complexes in the trace are essentially normal (T waves are very variable in animals), but there follows some very abnormal, bizarre shaped QRS complexes. QUESTION 6 • Attempt to interpret the ecg (this will be covered in more detail next week). • What do the bizarre QRS complexes most likely represent? 17 diaGnosis The ecg trace after the first two normal complexes is composed of a succession of ventricular premature complexes VPCs), which represent repeated episodes of abnormal ventricular depolarization. A succession of VPCs is known as ventricular tachycardia. Ventricular tachycardia results from repeated depolarization of the ventricles as a result of electrical stimulation from an abnormal focus. In this case it implies underlying disease of the ventricular muscle as a result of the cardiomyopathy. Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is primarily a disease of myocardial failure. The underlying cause of the myocardial failure is unknown in the ‘idiopathic’ form of the disease seen in Doberman Pinschers (as well as other large dog breeds such as Boxers, Great Danes, Irish Wolfhounds) although a genetic link has been found in many of these breeds. Drugs, infections, hormonal imbalances and nutritional deficiencies can cause myocardial failure and these need to be ruled out with a thorough history (and perhaps blood tests) in order to make a diagnosis of DCM. QUIZ 2 Click back to the LMS and attempt Quiz 2 before continuing. QUESTION 7 • What are the goals of drug therapy in Jack with respect to treatment of: 1. Preload? 2. Afterload? 3. Inotropic support? 4. Ventricular tachycardia? 18 treatment Once a diagnosis of congestive heart failure secondary to dilated cardiomyopathy with pulmonary oedema and paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia has been reached, you proceed to treat Jack. You start him off on furosemide (a diuretic) to alleviate the pulmonary oedema by reducing preload. You place him on a lignocaine infusion to control the ventricular tachycardia and later switch this to an oral equivalent (mexiletine) and you commence him on pimobendan to increase myocardial contractility. proGress You hospitalize Jack for three days, during which time he progresses well. His breathing improves rapidly as the pulmonary oedema resolves and his heart rate and rhythm are much improved. His demeanour improves markedly and he is happy to be taken outside for short walks. QUESTION 8 • What advice do you give the owners about Jack and his long-term outlook? 19 outcome At discharge you discuss Jack’s condition with Mrs. Daniels further. You summarize what is known about dilated cardiomyopathy and reinforce that even with treatment his lifespan is likely to be limited to a few weeks or possibly up to 6 months. He will require ongoing treatment and monitoring during this time and the cost of the pimobendan in particular is expensive in the long term. As well as his regular check-ups you advise the owners to monitor his respiratory rate when he is resting and to return immediately if this becomes accelerated again in the future or if he suddenly slows down again as he did last time. Jack did well for 9 months after his diagnosis and came back for regular rechecks. At these rechecks there was no evidence of a recurrence of the pulmonary oedema and his heart rhythm was fairly stable with occasional single ectopic beats heard on auscultation. He was maintained on low dose furosemide, mexiletine and pimobendan. He was quieter than he used to be, but still went for controlled walks and enjoyed a good quality of life. About 9 months after Jack initially presented, Mrs. Daniels came home from work to find Jack had passed away in the backyard. He had shown no signs of coughing or breathing difficulties beforehand. His death could have been the result of a fatal arrhythmia such as ventricular fibrillation resulting from his underlying cardiomyopathy. references Dukes McEwan J.
