Understand how radiology and ultrasound may be used for the assessment of the cardiovascular system • Heart disease is any abnormality of the heart, encompassing everything from valvular regurgitation to a persistent left cvc. • Heart failure is the end result of severe heart disease and is a clinical syndrome seen as congestion and oedema, poor peripheral perfusion and or systemic hypertension • Heart disease is always present when heart failure is present however heart disease can be present and never lead to heart failure • Ref Kittleson and Kienle p 136 A reminder..Changes with heart disease Alteration to size and or shape of cardiac silhouette Alteration to size of pulmonary vasculature Radiographic signs of cardiac failure: – Pulmonary oedema – Peritoneal effusion – Pleural effusion (cats) Radiographic features of cardiomegaly: •Lateral projection: – Increased apicobasilar distance and reduction of distance between heart and spine – Elevation of trachea – Compression of lumina of stem bronchi by left atrium – Ventral deflection of trachea at base of heart eliminated – Increased craniocaudal diameter of heart (width) – Straightening of caudal heart border – Expansion of left atrium into caudal lobar area (left atrial wedge) – Cranial bulging of right heart border and increased sternal contact – Change in direction of CVC – Vertebral Heart Score/scale •Ventrodorsal (dorsoventral projection) – Increased transverse diameter (width) of heart – Increased rounding and elongation of heart borders – “Bumpiness” of left heart border due to increased size of left auricle – Caudal and leftward displacement of cardiac silhouette – Cat “Valentine Shaped” heart – > 60-65% of thoracic width Radiographic features of cardiomegaly:The rules: DogThe rules: Cat T4 Vertebral Heart Scale (VHS) VHS = 13.5 Normal: Cat: < 8.0 Dog: < 10.7 Subsequent studies: • Boxer 11.6 +/- 0.8v • Cavalier King Charles 10.6 +/- 0.5 • Doberman 10.0 +/- 0.6 • Whippet 11.0 +/-0.5 • Pug 10.7 +/- 0.9 • Bull dog 12.7 +/- 1.7 VLAS Malcolm et al., 2018 Vertebral left atrial size (VLAS) • Measured from the cranial margin of T4 • Tracheal border at the carina to dorsal border of the caudal vena cava A VLAS ≥ 2.3 – 2.5 can be used as an indicator of LA enlargement Used in MMVD Cardiomegaly: MV endocardiosis Cardiomegaly: MV endocardiosis Cardiomegaly – pericardial effusion “Valentine Heart” The pulmonary vessels Pulmonary veins are ventral and central Pulmonary vessels Enlarged pulmonary veins 9th Cardiac disease vs cardiac failure • The heart can cope and employ compensatory mechanisms to function. • When it can’t = heart failure – Pulmonary oedema – Pleural effusion – Peritoneal effusion (ascites) Questions to ask • Is the heart enlarged/is there signs of remodeling? • Are there signs of cardiac failure? – Pulmonary oedema – Pleural effusion – Peritoneal effusion Left atrial enlargement and cardiogenic pulmonary oedema (DCM) Cat pleural effusion due to heart failure Peritoneal effusion UltrasoundEchocardiography Ultrasound assessment of cardiac function and chamber size • B mode • M Mode • Doppler- colour and spectral From “An Atlas and Textbook of Diagnostic Ultrasonography of the Dog and Cat” Nautrup and Tobias Medshop, 2023 Echocardiography Don’t be scared of Echo!
