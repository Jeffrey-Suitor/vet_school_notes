Cunningham 6th Edition, 2020 Loop of Henle • 3 functionally distinct parts: – Thin descending – Thin ascending – Thick ascending • Thin parts – not much active transport, mainly diffusion • Thick part – active reabsorption • Thin parts – important for urine concentration Loop of Henle – the thin bits • Thin descending loop of Henle – Highly permeable to water and moderately permeable to most solutes – 20% of filtered water reabsorbed here • Thin ascending loop of Henle – Impermeable to water – Important in concentrating urine Loop of Henle – the thin bits Bachmann & Kriz, 1999 Loop of Henle – the thick bit • Thick ascending loop of Henle – Active reabsorption of Na+, K+, Cl- – 25% of filtered load of these electrolytes and other ions reabsorbed here – Impermeable to water Loop of Henle – vasa recta • Blood flow through medulla is much less than the cortex – 1-2% of renal blood flow • Vasa recta are specialised peritubular capillaries • Important in mechanism for kidneys to concentrate urine Distal tubule – first half • First part forms macula densa – Sits adjacent to afferent and efferent arterioles of glomerulus – Part of juxtaglomerular apparatus – Feedback mechanism within same nephron Distal tubule – first half • Remainder of function similar to thick ascending loop of Henle – Active reabsorption sodium and chloride – Impermeable to water – “Diluting segment” Distal tubule – second half + cortical collecting tubule • Principal cells – More sodium and water reabsorption, potassium secretion • Intercalated cells – Acid-base regulation – Potassium reabsorption or secretion • Reabsorption under hormonal control – Aldosterone • Permeability under control of vasopressin (ADH) Collecting ducts • Medulla • Final site for urine processing • Vasopressin (ADH) controls permeability • Also some role in acid-base regulation – H+ excretion • Some urea reabsorbed Physiological control in the kidneys • Through constriction or relaxation of renal vasculature • Sympathetic nervous system – Innervates all renal blood vessels, including glomerular afferent and efferent arterioles – Most important mechanism for decreasing GFR in severe, acute, disturbances • Hormonal/autacoid control – Various hormones constrict or relax renal blood vessels, including glomerular afferent and efferent arterioles Main hormones at play in the kidneys (alter GFR) • Vasoconstrictors/vasodilators – Adrenaline/epinephrine (↓ GFR) – Noradrenaline/norepinephrine (↓ GFR) – Endothelin (↓ GFR) – Angiotensin II (prevents ↓ of GFR) – Nitric oxide (↑ GFR) – Prostaglandins (prevent ↓ of GFR) Main hormones at play in the kidneys (alter electrolyte & water handling) • Hormones that affect sodium/water reabsorption/excretion – Vasopressin (anti-diuretic hormone; ADH) – Aldosterone – Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA Copyright Regulations 1969 WARNING This material has been reproduced and communicated to you by or on behalf of the University of Melbourne pursuant to Part VB of the Copyright Act 1968 (the Act).
