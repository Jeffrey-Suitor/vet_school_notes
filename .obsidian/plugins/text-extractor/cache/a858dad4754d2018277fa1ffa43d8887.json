The tables are not all inclusive. You will be able to think of many more examples of veterinary advice to give in each category. Reptiles Small Mammals Terrestrial Aquatic Herbivores Carnivores Omnivores Example taxa Most squamate reptiles (lizards and snakes) Tortoises. Crocodilians Turtles Terrapins Water snakes. Rabbits Guinea pigs Ferrets Rodents Breeding Changing light cycle, temperature mosaic, humidity, feeding frequency. Providing egg laying site, and removing or reintroducing mate Changing light cycle, temperature, providing nesting site. Access to outdoor enclosure for local species. Sex ratio. Nesting material and hides. Diet changes during gestation and lactation. Preventing breeding by identifying and separating the sexes or using surgical or chemical means. Female ferrets stay on heat unless mated, desexed or treated chemically. Management Compatable sex ratio, age range and mix of species. Indoor versus outdoor enclosure set up, monitoring equipment and records. Temperature mosaic (on land), max and min temperature (water), humidity, ventilation. Light cycle and source, UVA and B speciﬁcations. Substrate. Furnishings. Cleaning. Appropriate sex ratio and mix of species. Indoor versus outdoor enclosure set up. Size appropriate to allow exercise and play opportunities appropriate to species. Feeding stations to allow equal access. Light cycle. Temperature range. Grooming. Dental care. Nutrition Insectivore, carnivore, herbivore. Snakes eat whole prey including rodents, small mammals, birds, lizards and frogs. Provide prey appropriate to predator species. For herbivores, provide a wide range of leafy greens and vegetables, supplement Vitamin A, calcium and Vitamin D Herbivore (sea turtles), ﬁsh and crustacean eaters, hunters of small and medium vertebrates For insectivores provide a wide range of invertebrate prey items dusted or gut loaded with calcium, vitamin D3 and multivitamin s. High ﬁbre for both- hay. Rabbits primarily hay and grazing plus some leafy greens. Guinea pigs require vitamin C source and can tolerate greater quantity and range of vegetables but still need to graze. Commercial pellets are useful as a small supplement. Balanced diet is either whole prey or commercial diet with high fat and protein content like the diets for domestic kittens. Rodents eat a wide range of vegetables, grains, insects and some meat. Balanced commercial pellets are available. Welfare Provide species speciﬁc enrichment opportunities , shelters and handling. Limit time out of POTZ. Water quality monitoring, ﬁltration and management of biological ﬁlter is essential. Provide appropriate dry basking areas. Prone to heat stroke above 24C. Require companions. Provide gnawing and grazing opportunities . Provide companions and plenty of play options. Avoid unbalanced muscle-meat diets. Provide gnawing opportunities . Require companions. Disease control Neurorespira tory viruses: Mite control. Quarantine of new animals in separate room with appropriate biosecurity. Viral testing of new animals to be introduced to a breeding colony. Quarantine of new animals before introducing to the tank or pond. Turtles in outdoor enclosures and allowed to roam are prone to predation and gardening trauma. Calicivirus: Vaccination. Myxomatosi s: No vacc in Aus. Mosquito and ﬂea protection Ecotoparasit e prevention. Guinea pigs ovarian cysts: desex. Rabbits dental disease: diet, breeding Vaccinate against distemper and parvovirus. Ectoparasite prevention against ﬂeas and mange mites. Endocrine diseases. Hormonal implants. Desex or implant females to prevent lethal anaemia due to persistent oestrus. No vaccinations available. Prone to respiratory inﬂammation and infection. Provide excellent ventilation and avoid introduction of diseased companions. Desexing rats reduces development of mammary tumours.

Species appropriate husbandry Animal Welfare considerations in all species. Think about how each aspect of this table applies to each of the species we are discussing this week. Environmental requirements and breeding information for selected reptiles are shown in the tables below from Bob Doneley’s chapter on Taxonomy and Introduction to Common Species in Reptile Medicine and Surgery in Clinical Practice. I do not need you to learn the numbers but be familiar with the range of conditions and how different the requirements are from one taxon to another with ectotherms.
