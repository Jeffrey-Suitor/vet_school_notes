Physiological skeletal muscle hypertrophy Hypertrophy of cardiac myofibres – note the increase in fibre diameter and nuclear enlargement In athletes of any species, increased work load through exercise can lead to physiological hypertrophy of cardiac and skeletal muscle fibres. Compensatory renal hypertrophy in a cat with unilateral renal agenesis Compensatory unilateral renal hypertrophy in a dog with unilateral renal dysplasia High caloric and high protein diets can lead to hypertrophy of exocrine pancreatic cells (H&E stain). Severe chronic hypertrophy of the left ventricular myocardium in a cat with chronic systemic hypertension Chronic hypertrophy of the smooth muscle of the oesophagus in a horse with a functional downstream obstruction Chronic hypertrophy of airway smooth muscle in a sheep with parasitic bronchitis Clitoris of a normal eweClitoral hypertrophy in a ewe exposed to oestrogenic pasture There is an upper limit to the degree of cell enlargement in hypertrophy. This is dictated by the need for diffusion of oxygen and nutrients into cells and their metabolic rate. Hypertrophy has its disadvantages. In this cat, the left ventricular hypertrophy is drastically reducing the stroke volume and hence cardiac output and may well be impairing filling of the right ventricle. Hyperplasia Only labile and stable cells can undergo hyperplasia. Permanent cells such as fully differentiated cardiac muscle fibres and neurons cannot undergo hyperplasia because they cannot undergo mitosis. Hyperplasia of gastric mucosal folds in a dog Dog with an ACTH-producing pituitary tumour (arrow) causing bilateral hyperplasia of the cortices of the adrenal glands Dog with an ACTH-producing pituitary tumour causing bilateral hyperplasia of the cortices of the adrenal glands (arrows) Hyperplasia of the parathyroid glands of a dog due to a sustained decrease in the serum ionised calcium concentration because of kidney failure Lamb with congenital hyperplastic goitre resulting from hypertrophy and hyperplasia of thyroid follicular epithelial cells under the influence of excess thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) Hyperplastic goitre in a lamb Hyperplastic goitre in a foetal lamb Hyperplastic goitre in a foetal calf Early stages of hyperplastic goitre – the pink material is colloid in the thyroid follicles (H&E stain) Advanced stage of hyperplastic goitre – absence of colloid and excess follicular cells crowded into follicular lumina (H&E stain) Fronds of hyperplastic follicular epithelium in hyperplastic goitre (H&E stain) Mammary fibroadenomatous hyperplasia in a young female cat due to stimulation by endogenous progesterone or exogenous synthetic progestagens Cystic endometrial hyperplasia in a bitch uterus due to stimulation by endogenous progesterone (H&E stain) Appearance of the endometrial mucosa of the uterus in a bitch with cystic endometrial hyperplasia Normal canine urinary bladder and prostate (top) versus benign prostatic hyperplasia and secondary bladder smooth muscle hypertrophy (bottom) Lichenification of skin – a manifestation of epidermal hyperplasia and hyperkeratosis in response to chronic pressure or friction Enlargement of splenic white pulp follicles due to hyperplasia of lymphocytes in response to antigenic stimulation Hyperplasia of the gingival (gum) mucosa in a dog Nodular hyperplasia of hepatocytes in a dog with cirrhosis (end- stage liver disease) Metaplasia Squamous metaplasia of upper respiratory tract epithelium in a rat forced to chronically inhale smoke in an experiment (H&E stain) Squamous metaplasia of bronchial epithelium in a human smoker (H&E stain) Chronic irritation of the mucosa of the urinary bladder (e.g. by calculi) can cause squamous or glandular metaplasia of the transitional epithelium. Squamous metaplasia of upper alimentary tract mucus-secreting glands in a bird with vitamin A deficiency Squamous metaplasia of mucus-secreting glands of the oral cavity in a bird with vitamin A deficiency (H&E stain) Hyperplasia and squamous metaplasia of the prostate (arrow) of a dog with an oestrogen-producing testicular tumour Squamous metaplasia of prostate glands in a dog with an oestrogen-secreting testicular tumour (H&E stain) Mucoid metaplasia and hyperplasia of the abomasal mucosa in a sheep with Ostertagia spp. infestation Metaplasia of stratified squamous epithelium (right) to an intestinal type epithelium (left) in a human with Barrett oesophagitis (H&E stain) Formation of metaplastic bone (arrow) in the subcapsular parenchyma of the liver of a pig Osseous metaplasia in perirenal fat in a pig Metaplastic cartilage and bone at the margin of a stifle joint in a dog Metaplastic bone and cartilage at the margin of a joint Osseous metaplasia in the spinal dura mater of a dog (“ossifying pachymeningitis”) Osseous metaplasia in the spinal dura mater of a dog (“ossifying pachymeningitis”) Dysplasia The term dysplasia is used both for both congenital disorders characterised by cell disorganisation (e.g. chondrodysplasia in calves above) and acquired disorders in which hyperplasia of cells is disorderly or atypical. Microscopic features of acquired dysplasia (right) in chronically irritated respiratory epithelium that has previously undergone squamous metaplasia Anaplasia Nasal squamous cell carcinoma (a malignant neoplasm or tumour arising from squamous epithelial cells) in a catBronchial squamous cell carcinoma in a dog (H&E stain) Fine needle aspirate from a squamous cell carcinoma (Papanicolau stain) – note the variation in cell and nuclear size and the enlarged nuclei and nucleoli, features of malignancy Anaplastic features in a squamous cell carcinoma, including an abnormal mitotic figure (arrow) (H&E stain) Anaplastic features in a fibrosarcoma (a malignant tumour of fibroblasts), including an abnormal mitotic figure (arrow) (H&E stain)","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
