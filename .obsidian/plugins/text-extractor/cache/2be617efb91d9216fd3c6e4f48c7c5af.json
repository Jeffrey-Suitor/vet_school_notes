Size of paddock and feed, topography (hills, watercourses, trees etc), likely cow cyclicity, environmental conditions (heat/rain etc) • Varies – in NT likely 4 bulls per 100 cows, in Vic 2-3 bulls. • Benefit of multisire joining to reduce risk Cow condition score • Please review the websites following this video for images of condition scoring • Target CS for cows in Southern Australia • No lower than 2.5 at calving for autumn • No lower than 2.5 at start of mating for autumn calving • No lower than 2.0 at calving for spring calving (these cows will get better nutrition than autumn calving) • Similar figures for cows in tropical areas but time of calving moved, allow extra CS where lack of supplementary feed, ideally CS 3 at calving Critical mating weight (CMW) CMW varies with frame score and breed 85% of heifers to become pregnant over six week joining (will vary for each enterprise) General rule = 60-65% of adult weight Growth rate required for CMW = (Mating weight – birth weight)/days between birth and mating (600+g/d for 2 y.o) Source of genetics • Bulls, artificial insemination or embryo transfer (or livestock purchase) • AI and ET most commonly used by stud industry, but if bull prices increase then more commercial may use AI • Range of options to synchronise cows to AI on same day (FTAI) • Identify heat via range of methods (usually paint or device on tail) • Requires multiple musters of the herd • ET often used in studs to access entire new lines of genetics that may not be available otherwise • Bull costs currently vary from 5,000 to more than 50,000, many commercial bulls selling in the 10,000 range Crossbreeding • Range of genetics can be combined to meet a target outcome • If you owned Herefords, could join to Angus to stop the need for disbudding/dehorning • Relatively simple to make this change • Some traits however have many genes involved – how do we assess? Breedplan Breedplan • For traits such as growth there are many genes involved • Expression is a combination of genes and environment (feed) • We want to be able to assess the genes part of that! • BREEDPLAN – BLUP analysis to produce EBVs • EBVs = genetic merit for a particular trait (removes environmental influence – note = ESTIMATED!) • Compares result to genetic base in particular year • Uses actual animal data combined with all relative data and cohort data Breedplan EBVs Breedplan • Doesn’t give you full physical information, still need to assess the animal e.g. structural traits • Allows faster genetic progress (but choose wisely in case you progress in wrong direction!) • Selection often across an index rather than single trait Genomics • Challenge with genetics is need individual animal information to get high levels of accuracy, so need to wait a year or two for some traits such as 400 day weight • Fertility can take decades • Genomics can improve selection process once sample is collected – potentially in first week of life • Thousands of genetic markers (SNPs) assessed from hair sample • Very beneficial in stud selection process • Requires a genomics herd/flock to maintain accuracy (phenotype/genotype) http://sbts.une.edu.au/media/1069/genomicsintro.pdf Example • Bull sale","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
