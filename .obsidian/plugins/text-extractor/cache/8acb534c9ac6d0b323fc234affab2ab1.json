Others are used by the hepatocytes to synthesise cholesterol esters or phospholipids or are oxidised to form ketone bodies - Most incoming fatty acids are esterified by the hepatocytes to form triglycerides - The triglycerides are then packaged by the hepatocytes with apoproteins to form VLDL exported into the circulation as a readily available energy source for other tissues. - Hepatic lipidosis may develop if any of the steps in normal hepatic lipid metabolism is compromised: synthesis of apoproteins and the packaging of apoproteins and triglycerides into VLDL for export, as these steps require considerable energy consumption by hepatocytes - Esterification of fatty acids to triglycerides is less energy-dependent and may continue, even in an injured hepatocyte What other organs or systems are commonly affected by lipid degeneration? Give examples. -Liver, Kidney, Myocardium (heart) DVM1: Cells to Systems 2023 Cell/Tissue Degeneration and Necrosis Histopathology Practical Dr Yuchi Chen DVM1: Cells to Systems 2023 Cell/Tissue Degeneration and Necrosis Histopathology Practical Dr Yuchi Chen Degeneration Slide 3 Feline Liver Go to https://slice.edu.au/s/d23af689 Name the different types of amyloidosis and their causes: a) AL (light chain): derived from antibody (immunoglobulin) light chains (especially λ light chains) produced by plasma cells b) AA (SAA): is often referred to as secondary or reactive amyloidosis because increased hepatic synthesis and release of SAA occurs as a response to active inflammation and/or tissue damage anywhere in the body c) IAPP (islet amyloid): is derived from the hormone, islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), which is normally co-secreted with insulin by β islet cells and antagonises the action of insulin by stimulating breakdown of muscle glycogen (increased blood glucose) d) Aβ: in association with cerebral plaques with Alzhemier’s disease e) APrP: Amyloid derived from misfolded proteins: in some of the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE), amyloid deposits composed of misfolded proteins may develop in the brain. in these disorders, the amyloid is thought to be due to aberrant post-translational misfolding (β-pleating) of a normal α-helical host cell membrane sialoglycoprotein (PrPc), caused by exposure to a prion (a proteinaceous infectious particle) (PrPSc) Find the following structures: - Portal triads - Bile ducts - Central vein - Hepatic arterial branch - Portal vein - Lymphatics Zoom in and look for the areas of pallor. Describe the location of the amyloid accumulation and what structures are affected. - Location: amyloid appears as amorphous, homogeneous, eosinophilic (pink) extracellular material in the perisinusoidal space (space of Disse), between the hepatocytes and the vascular sinusoids (capillaries). - Structures affected: hepatocytes (atrophied), sinusoids (vasculature/ blood circulation). What are the main effects of amyloidosis? - mild to moderate forms of amyloidosis may be asymptomatic DVM1: Cells to Systems 2023 Cell/Tissue Degeneration and Necrosis Histopathology Practical Dr Yuchi Chen - amyloid deposits can cause physical compression of adjacent cells and compromised vascular perfusion leading to atrophy or cell degeneration (with decreased cell function) or cell death - severe hepatic amyloidosis can cause risk of spontaneous liver rupture leading to potentially fatal haemoperitoneum (haemorrhage into the peritoneal cavity) - animals with renal amyloidosis often succumb to renal failure and those with renal glomerular amyloidosis may suffer from hypoproteinaemia due to loss of circulating proteins through the damaged glomeruli into urine.

Describe the histological differences between the degenerate cells and necrotic cells. - Degenerate cells: swollen pale hepatocytes, filled with water (free in the cytoplasm) or lipid (vacuolated), nucleus might be displaced to the periphery - Necrotic cells: shrunken or normal size hepatocytes, dark-staining cytoplasm (hypereosinophilic), nucleus might be darkly stained and condensed (pyknotic), fading (lytic), fragmented (karyorrhectic) Name the types of nuclear changes seen in a necrotic cell. a) Pyknotic: condensed nucleus, dark-staining b) Karyolytic: fading nucleus c) Karyorrhectic: fragmented nucleus What are the differences between apoptosis and oncotic necrosis? Feature Necrosis Apoptosis Cell size Enlarged (swelling) Reduced (shrinkage) Nucleus Pyknosis →karyorrhexis →karyolysis Fragmentation into nucleosome- size fragments Plasma membrane Disrupted Intact; altered structure, especially orientation of lipids Cellular contents Enzymatic digestion; may leak out of cell Intact; may be released in apoptotic bodies Adjacent inflammation Frequent No Physiologic or pathologic role Invariably pathologic (culmination of irreversible cell injury) Often physiologic, means of eliminating unwanted cells; may be pathologic after some forms of cell injury, especially DNA damage DVM1: Cells to Systems 2023 Cell/Tissue Degeneration and Necrosis Histopathology Practical Dr Yuchi Chen DVM1: Cells to Systems 2023 Cell/Tissue Degeneration and Necrosis Histopathology Practical Dr Yuchi Chen Necrosis Slide 2 Ovine Testicle Go to https://slice.edu.au/s/0dfcedf5 Find the following structures - Testis - Epididymis - Tunica albuginea - Tunica vaginalis Find the area of coagulative necrosis. Describe the histological features of this type of necrosis. Cytoplasmic changes include: Progressive severe cell swelling, increased cytoplasmic eosinophilia, cytoplasmic pallor with a moth- eaten fragmented appearance, detachment from basement membranes and surrounding cells (sloughing) or simply rupture (ghost outlines of cell debris) Nucleus changes include: Cell nuclei may undergo one of the following morphological changes: • pyknosis = a shrunken, darkly staining (basophilic, hyperchromatic) nucleus • karyorrhexis = rupture of the nuclear envelope with extrusion of dark nuclear fragments • karyolysis = fading of the nucleus Give examples of tissues susceptible to coagulative necrosis. Heart, Kidneys, Adrenal glands, Liver, Spleen, etc DVM1: Cells to Systems 2023 Cell/Tissue Degeneration and Necrosis Histopathology Practical Dr Yuchi Chen DVM1: Cells to Systems 2023 Cell/Tissue Degeneration and Necrosis Histopathology Practical Dr Yuchi Chen Necrosis Slide 3 Ovine Skeletal muscle Go to https://slice.edu.au/s/5d60c4b3 Describe the changes to the tissue that you can recognize. - Necrotic cells: fragmentation of muscle fibres, brightly pink cytoplasm (hypereosinophilia), pyknosis, karyolysis, karyorrhectic nuclei - Proteinaceous oedema - Gas bubbles - Inflammatory cells - Distended lymphatics What causes this type of necrosis? This disease is produced by spore-forming anaerobic bacteria, Clostridium species (known as ‘Blackleg’). Bacterial spores are eaten in contaminated feed or soil by the animal, then enter the bloodstream and lodge in various organs and tissues, including muscles. Here they lie dormant until stimulated to multiply, possibly by some slight injury to the animal. The injury reduces blood flow to the area, thereby reducing the supply of oxygen to the tissues. In the absence of oxygen, the spores germinate and multiply. As they grow, the bacteria produce toxins which destroy surrounding tissues. The toxins are absorbed into the animal’s bloodstream which makes the animal acutely sick and causes rapid death. Name the types of gangrene and describe their difference. a) Dry gangrene: coagulative necrosis induced by ischaemia (i.e. infarction). The affected tissue eventually mummifies due to dehydration that causes shriveled, dry and brown to black tissue that eventual will slough b) Wet gangrene: necrosis of tissue (usually of coagulative type) that is then colonised by bacteria causing liquefaction and putrefaction. c) Gas gangrene: a type of coagulative necrosis where affected tissue becomes moist, soft, red- brown to black and is malodorous due to gas production by the bacteria DVM1: Cells to Systems 2023 Cell/Tissue Degeneration and Necrosis Histopathology Practical Dr Yuchi Chen DVM1: Cells to Systems 2023 Cell/Tissue Degeneration and Necrosis Histopathology Practical Dr Yuchi Chen Necrosis Slide 4 Bovine Adipose tissue Go to https://slice.edu.au/s/45daa6c5 What is the normal morphology of adipocytes? Are any of these cells normal adipocytes? Normal adipocyte: A round-shaped cell that contain often a single large lipid vacuole surrounded by a layer of cytoplasm. The nucleus is flattened and located on the periphery. None of the adipocytes present in the slide are normal, they are undergoing coagulative necrosis or are mummified. Nuclei are not identifiable, and the cellular margins are often irregular and poorly defined. Describe the histological changes. - Wispy to crystallized content or multiple lipid vacuoles of variable size - Nucleus is not identifiable What other types of cells can you recognise in this slide? - Fibroblasts - Multinucleated giant cells - Macrophages - Lymphocytes - Plasma cells DVM1: Cells to Systems 2023 Cell/Tissue Degeneration and Necrosis Histopathology Practical Dr Yuchi Chen DVM1: Cells to Systems 2023 Cell/Tissue Degeneration and Necrosis Histopathology Practical Dr Yuchi Chen","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
