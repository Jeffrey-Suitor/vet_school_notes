How many animals could a farm in 650mm annual average rainfall carry? • French model • SR = 1.3*(65-250)/2.5 • SR = 20.8 DSE/Ha • Requires good pasture and fertility • Winter = pasture limiting time in southern Australia, so estimated winter stocking rate • What does 21 DSE/Ha translate to for different lambing times? • AUTUMN lambing = 2.4 DSE in winter (lactating) 21 DSE/2.4 = 8.75 ewes/Ha SPRING lambing = 1.7 DSE in winter when pregnant 21/1.7= 12.4 spring lambing ewes Can carry about 50% more ewes (more wool and lambs produced) Marking • 2 weeks after lambing finishes (reduce mismothering) • First vaccination • Castration • Tail docking (3rd joint at tip of vulva, ring or knife/heat) • Count – marking % (lambs present / ewes) • Marking % can vary – 70-150%, breed, time of year, nutrition, CS etc • Mulesing? Sheep vaccinations • Almost all killed vaccines need two doses (4-6 weeks apart) and then yearly • Exception = JD vaccine (Gudair) • 5 in 1 • 6 in 1 • Erysipelas • Scabigard (single shot) • Gudair (single shot) • Campyvax (campylobacter) • Barbervax (H. contortus) Weaning • 12-16 weeks post lambing start (5 week lambing) • At 12 weeks Merino ewe lactation decreased – may leave other breeds longer as lactation longer • Get lambs away from parasites and onto high quality grass/feed • Youngest lambs >6 weeks for functional rumen • 2nd vaccination • Drench (almost always have parasites) • May snatch rear goat kids for disease control – wean once eating enough solid feed Prime lamb sales • Start from about 16 weeks of age • Lambs sold straight from dams are called “suckers” • Other lambs weaned, sell all before first adult teeth in wear • Might sell as “store” lambs, not finished • Store lambs may go onto grain, grass, stubbles etc • Higher rainfall favours finishing systems hence stock may move from pastoral to wheat/sheep or wheat/sheep to high rainfall for “finishing” Retained weaners (Merino) • How to feed over summer? • Containment/feedlot • High energy, protein • Check random sample every 4-6 weeks for growth Strategic treatments • Designed to control pathogens at critical life cycle stages • Eg. Summer drenching • Winter worms come from late spring/summer pasture contamination, so give 2 summer drenches in Dec/Feb • Apply fly chemical to sheep in early spring to reduce following fly generations – covert strikes reduced • Monitor over strike period • Lice – often treated off shears in case lice present (can be hard to detect) Culling • Age • Teeth • Wool • Other (type) • Often done in early summer – stock in maximum condition and wont require supplementary feed. Generally shorn prior to sale. Optimal age of ewes generally 6 years (varies from region to region) Condition score targets • Ewes need to be CS 3 at mating (not too fat but good fertility) • Monitor CS pre-joining • Manage nutrition as necessary (care with $, budget) • Breeding soundness exam for rams Managing fly risk • Blowfly activity increases into spring (warmth, moisture) • ?chemical prophylaxis • Crutching • Shearing Shearing • Generally done once annually, some properties may reduce to every eight months – need to get adequate length of wool • Often summer or early autumn • If lice are present, apply eradication insecticide “off shears” • Apply long wool preparation to limit damage if necessary (depends on $ as to best option)","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
