These drugs are called emetics. Question • Just want to confirm that for vomiting when the glottis is closed and deep inspiration happens, the diaphragm contracts and that will push onto the stomach → decreasing the volume of the stomach/whole abdomen and hence increasing the intra-abdominal pressure? Is the intra-abdominal pressure referred to the pressure within the whole abdomen or a digestive organ wherever the food is? Answer • As the pressure increases inside the abdomen that will affect the pressure applied (externally) on all the organs, hence forcing content to escape from the stomach through the relaxed sphincters. • … so how does that differ from the pressure changes in Jack’s abdomen in today’s case study?? Some really good questions Question • “If receptors are specific to their ligands, how can this drug (phenothiazine) bind to both kinds of receptors and at different doses? Do these receptors have similar shapes or sections in their site that allow this to happen?” Answer • It’s all about “fit” – between the receptor and the drug. And some drugs – the “dirty ones” – fit (perhaps a bit “loosely”) to multiple different receptors. Also, if you give higher doses, any drug will tend to bind less specifically to a range of receptors – you will discuss this more in VB: Cells to Systems in a couple of weeks. This fits into the discipline of pharmacodynamics Some really good questions Question • Regarding Cisapride’s effect to apparently increase ACh release, you said that it is used with a poorly understood mechanism of action, how is it allowed to be used when it is poorly understood? Is it available for use in clinics or only in experimentation? Answer • There are multiple examples of drugs that were used for decades without a clear understanding of how they work- and that is still the case for some commonly used anaesthetic drugs. Some really good questions Question • “Just wanted to clarify that both the threshold and membrane voltage can move in response to the mechanical/hormonal/neural factors in order to contract?” Answer • The membrane voltage fluctuates in response to the factors you describe above. This brings the voltage closer to or further away from the threshold at which depolarisation occurs. • As the channels that allow entry of ions to the cell and initiate an action potential are voltage gated (ie voltage dependent), when the membrane voltage reaches that which opens voltage gated channels, then an action potential will result. Some really good questionsJack’s Night Out Intended learning outcomes At the end of this learning exercise, you should be able to: • Draw a flow diagram to explain the pathophysiology of GDV. • Visualize the changes in the configuration of the stomach that occur in GDV in order to prepare you to surgically correct this condition in the future. • Outline the principles of treatment and management of gastric dilation and volvulus (GDV) in the dog. • Appreciate the systemic effects that may arise as a consequence of a changes in the configuration of the digestive tract. Presentation • Why was Jack ‘retching’? And what was the froth he was bringing up? • How can you distinguish between vomiting and regurgitation? RadiographGastric volvulusVolvulus vs. torsion • Confusion exists (!) • Some references use terms interchangeably • Depends on the use of “around”, “along” or “across” • From Quiz 2: • Volvulus = abnormal twisting of a segment of the gastrointestinal tract along its longitudinal axis • Torsion = abnormal twisting of a segment of the gastrointestinal tract along its short axis • From A/Prof. Jenny Charles lecture notes: • Volvulus = rotation on the mesenteric axis • Torsion = rotation of the intestine across its long axis Intestine cranial caudal dorsal ventral Connecting peritoneum (omentum or mesentery) are included in the twist Long axisShort axis Volvulus Mesentery Gastric volvulus Intestinal volvulus Caecum cranial caudal dorsal ventral No connecting peritoneum (omentum or mesentery) included in twist Long axisShort axis Torsion Torsion of the caecum in a horse (no mesentery involved) Consequences • From Lecture 7 (Prof. Simon Bailey) • More detailed pathology in Lecture 19 (Dr Liz Dobson) Drugs used in the post-operative period • Methadone – opioid: pain relief • Metoclopramide – dopamine receptor antagonist: prokinetic / anti-emetic • Maropitant – NK1 receptor antagonist: anti-emetic • Pantoprazole – proton pump inhibitor: antacid • Sucralfate – viscous barrier: gastroprotectant / antacid Food for thought • Prophylactic gastropexy at the time of desexing for deep chested dogs? Flow diagram Case Study Assessment • Canvas Quiz • Released this afternoon (April 6) • Complete by 11:59pm on Monday April 17 (first day back after mid-semester break) • 60 minutes to complete • No collaboration • Contribution to overall Digestive System grade (3.75%) MST • Monday April 24 at 9am – online Canvas quiz • 60 minutes / 50 marks • Section A: MCQ (approx. 30% of marks). • Section B: Short-answer questions (approx. 40% of marks). • Section C: Extended-response question (approx. 30% of marks). Clinical scenario. • Examinable material: • Lectures 1-15 • Practicals 1-6 • Case studies 1-2 • Preparatory module in Canvas MST technique • Will be significantly harder than case study quizzes • Online open book • But will be time pressure – won’t have time to look everything up • Ensure that you answer the extended-response question • Dot points OK • Use appropriate scientific terminology and language • Cutting/pasting from notes is considered plagiarism – and might not answer the question anyway • Review practice test on Canvas and tutorial on how to approach answering extended-response questions • Ask questions – the sooner the better Have a nice break!","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
