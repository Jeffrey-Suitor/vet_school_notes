Insensitive - ~75% of kidney function lost before they increase • Creatinine measurement in plasma and urine to calculate eGFR • Creatinine clearance • More complex testing involving administration of a substance that is not reabsorbed or secreted, measuring plasma and urine concentrations to calculate eGFR Glomerular filtration rate • Kept relatively constant despite changes in BP, intravascular volume, etc. • How? • Can’t change permeability and surface area of capillaries (in health) • PRESSURE Glomerular filtration rate • Bowman’s capsule pressure and glomerular colloid osmotic pressure OPPOSE filtration • Glomerular hydrostatic pressure DRIVES filtration • This is the easiest factor to change • Controlled by: • Arterial pressure • Afferent arteriolar resistance • Efferent arteriolar resistance Guyton & Hall, 14th Ed. 2021 What could possibly go wrong? Plasma creatinine concentration = 926 μmol/L; reference range 40-80 μmol/L Physiological control of GFR • Mostly changes hydrostatic pressure in the glomerular capillaries • Influenced by: • Arterial blood pressure • Afferent arteriolar resistance • Efferent arteriolar resistance • Mechanisms: • Sympathetic nervous system • Autacoid/hormonal control • Tubuloglomerular feedback (autoregulation) Guyton & Hall, 14th Ed. 2021 How do the arterioles know what to do? • ↑ BP → afferent arteriolar constriction → ↓ glomerular hydrostatic pressure and ↓ filtration at the glomerulus • ↓ BP → efferent arteriolar constriction → ↑ glomerular hydrostatic pressure and ↑ filtration at the glomerulus • However, if efferent arterioles are severely constricted, glomerular filtration actually decreases: • Glomerular colloid osmotic pressure increases • Overall renal blood flow decreases • What makes either arteriole constrict? Guyton & Hall, 14th Ed. 2021 Sympathetic nervous system • All renal blood vessels innervated by sympathetic nerves • Only strong sympathetic activation will cause constriction of renal arterioles • Most important in severe, acute disturbances, e.g. severe haemorrhage, defense reaction Autacoid/hormonal control • Adrenaline/epinephrine and noradrenaline/norepinephrine • Same effect as SNS activation • Constrict renal arterioles; ↓ GFR • (Endothelin; ↓ GFR) • Angiotensin II • Produced when BP decreases • Preferentially constricts efferent arteriole → maintenance of normal GFR • Nitric oxide • Vasodilatory, ↑ GFR • Prostaglandins • PGE2 & PGI2 • Vasodilatory, oppose vasoconstriction, maintenance of normal GFR Autacoid/hormonal control – what could possibly go wrong?
