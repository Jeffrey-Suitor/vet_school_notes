This is very much a generalization, and it should be noted that some features may be extremely variable (e.g. Galvayne’sgroove). Also there are breed variations etc. For a more complete picture, read the Chapter on ageing horses in ‘Equine Dentistry’by Easley et al., which is provided in .pdfformat here on the LMS. Once you have familiarized yourself with the basic principles, examine the photographs of the horses (1-9). Estimate their ages.Then go on to the further slides where the main features are identified and their correct ages displayed.

Horse 9: Estupenda(Thoroughbred)•What features can you identify?•How old? Answers……Horse 1: Storm (Thoroughbred)•2 years 6 months. First pair of adult incisors just erupting. Horse 2: Scarlet (Thoroughbred)•2 years 4 months. All deciduous incisors in wear, no adult incisors yet erupted. Note lingual caruncles(arrow) where ducts from mandibularand sublingual salivary glands terminate in the mouth. Horse 3: Scooter (Standardbred)•17 years old. Angle between upper and lower arcades of incisors decreasing considerably. Occlusaloutlines of lower incisors going from rounded to slightly more triangular. Stars are round and marks (enamel spots) have gone. In the centre of the marks is secondary dentine which does not stain. Horse 4: Sharky(Standardbred)•12 years old. Angle between upper and lower arcades of incisors <180 degrees. Occlusalsurfaces of lower incisors quite rounded. Marks present in inner and middle incisors, cups just present in lateral incisors. Stars present on all incisors.Horse 5: Bianca (Andalusian x)•12 years old. Angle between upper and lower arcades of incisors <180 degrees. Occlusalsurfaces of lower incisors quite rounded. Marks present in inner incisors, cups still present in middle and lateral incisors. Stars present butnot clearly visible. [Galvayne’sgroove starting to appear. Slight hook (‘13 yr hook’) on lateral upper incisor]. Horse 6: Murphy (Thoroughbred)•17 years and six months. Angle between upper and lower arcades of incisors approx 120 degrees. Lower incisor arcade quite straight -Compare with Scooter (also 17): lower incisor arcade still curved. Occlusalsurfaces of lower incisors starting to become triangular. Dental cups disappeared, enamel marks (spots)remain; stars visible in all incisors. Galvayne’sgroove has virtually reached the bottom of the tooth. Horse 7: Trixie(Thoroughbred)•14 years and six months. Angle between upper and lower arcades of incisors approx 120 degrees. Occlusalsurfaces of lower incisors starting to become triangular. Dental cups disappeared, enamel marks (spots)present; stars visible in all incisors. Horse 8: Amy (Thoroughbred)•12 years and 6 months. Angle between upper and lower arcades of incisors approx 120 degrees. Occlusalsurfaces of lower incisors are rounded in cross-section and starting to become triangular. Dental cups disappeared, enamel spots present; stars visible in all incisors. Clear hook on outer upper incisor (‘13-year hook’); Galvayne’sgroove just visible at the top. Horse 9: Estupenda(Thoroughbred)•23 years and 6 months. Angle between upper and lower arcades of incisors is quite marked (particularly the angle of the lower incisors). Occlusalsurfaces of lower incisors are very elongated. Dental cups and marks disappeared. The stars are circular and central and the white rings in the middle are pale unstained secondary dentine with some tertiary dentine (darker) in the middle.","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
