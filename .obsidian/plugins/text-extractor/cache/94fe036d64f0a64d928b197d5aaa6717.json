Role of the vet • General practitioners should have a basic understanding of biology, specific husbandry needs, behaviour and common diseases • Veterinary practice should be a well- recognised and trusted source of information and first port of call - Rarely happens; vets are only consulted when animals become sick. • Will help to prevent a large array of common but easily avoided diseases – welfare and economic benefits • Individual pets, breeders, suppliers, pet shops • Laboratory animal practice Small mammals • Range of domesticated and non-domesticated species - rodents, rabbits, ferrets, hedgehogs, marsupials, small primates etc • Traditionally children’s pets – no longer the case • Key areas of advice are: • Basic biology – sexing • Nutrition • Housing and environmental requirements • Behavioural management • This lecture on rodents, rabbits and ferrets Behaviour • Rodents and rabbits are prey species • Easily stressed by sight, sound, smell of predators, unfamiliar surroundings, large bright open spaces • Adverse effects on gut health/motility and immune function • Hide overt signs of disease until advanced • Important to minimize stress at all times Rodents • Two main taxonomic groups, based on anatomy and biology • Important differences in dentition, diet and gastrointestinal function, and reproductive strategies that influence their predisposition to disease and their veterinary care. • MOUSE, RAT, HAMSTER, GERBIL are Myomorphs – the ‘mouse-like’ rodents: • GUINEA PIG (CAVY), CHINCHILLA, DEGU are Hystricomorphs – the ‘porcupine-like’ rodents: • A third group sometimes kept as pets are the Scuiromorphs – the ‘squirrel- like‘ rodents, such as chipmunks and prairie dogs MYOMORPHS: MICE, RATS, GERBILS, HAMSTERS HYSTRICOMORPHS: GUINEA PIGS(CAVY,) CHINCHILLAS, DEGUS Rodents - General Points • ‘Rodere’ = to gnaw (latin) • Sharp, chisel-shaped curved incisor teeth – grow continuously • Large diastema • Mandible wider than maxilla • Gnawing - lower jaw forward, incisors oppose • Chewing - lower incisors behind upper, cheek teeth oppose Guinea pig Rodents - General Points • Dental formula: Incisors, Canines, Premolars, Molars on one side of mouth: upper/lower • 1/1 0/0 0/0 3/3 (myomorphs) • 1/1 0/0 1/1 3/3 (hystricomorphs) • Sharp chisel shaped incisors, constant growth • Cheek teeth (pre-molars and molars) constant growth in hystricomorphs Guinea pig Chinchilla – overgrown cheek teeth Rodents - General Points • Simple stomach, sacculated caecum. • Coprophagic - Vitamins B and K. • Separate vaginal and urethral openings • Vaginal plug post mating • Hamsters - cheek pouches. • Flank sebaceous glands in male Golden/Syrian hamsters • Gerbils and Russian hamsters - ventral scent gland. • Social animals; Desexing important for population control and disease prevention → Usually males • Housing: Open sided cages for ventilation, shredded paper, recycled-paper cat litter Enrichment: cardboard rolls, wooden blocks for chewing, coloured paper, food reward puzzles Common diseases: • Rats- Respiratory disease, benign mammary adenocarcinoma, pituitary adenomas • Mice- Malignant mammary neoplasia • Rats and Mice • Diet: Omnivorous; commercial pellets, fresh produce, sunflower seeds as treats only Enrichment, Enrichment, EnrichmentEnrichment, Enrichment, EnrichmentHamsters • Golden/ Syrian Hamsters : Solitary, hibernate <5°C • Russian Hamsters: Social, do not hibernate • Housing: Cages - wire, plastic, glass, tunnel systems • Cage furniture - exercise wheel, wood • Bedding - deep shavings, nest box • Do not use cotton wool • Diet: Commercial rodent pellet, vegetables, nuts, occasional insects, animal protein in wild; Hoard food • Common diseases: Demodectic mange, skin tumours Enrichment, Enrichment, Enrichment Typical hamster ‘starter’ packs available in pet stores pose real welfare concerns, failing to provide the rodent with adequate space FACT In the wild can travel up to 10km per day Gerbils • Desert animal from Mongolia • Social - single sex groups, breeding pair • Housing: ‘Gerbilarium’ - plastic, glass tank, mesh lid, Bedding - deep shavings, peat, sawdust, avoid sand. Cardboard rolls, boxes • Dustbath • Diet: Commercial rodent mix, vegetables, fruit,occasional insects in wild, ‘Seed Junkies’ - beware obesity • Breeding: Form monogamous pairs, male assists in rearing • Common diseases: nasal dermatitis, scent gland tumours, epilepsy • Highly social animals; best in pairs or harems. Neuter if not breeding • Do not keep with rabbits • Diet: 70-80% grass hay (Oaten) • + 20-30% fresh, leafy greens + • 0-5% pellets and treats (Oxbow) • Housing: Secure, well ventilated. Hides essential. • Substrate: Newspaper, grass hay (indoors) or grass (outside, rotate position) • Enrichment: Hides, seagrass mats/tunnels, cardboard rolls Guinea Pigs Preventative medicine: • Desexing (females= ovarian cysts) • Vitamin C supplementation • Parasites- Selamectin, ivermectin Common diseases: • Dental disease (acquired) • Mange mites • Gut stasis • Cardiomyopathy • Lymphoma Guinea PigsChinchillas • Nocturnal • Dense fur, easily damaged • Housing: Singly or breeding pair; Indoors, large wire cages (gnaw),nest boxes, wood, branches • Dust bath • Diet: Hay, chinchilla pellets, occasional veg • Breeding: Pair or harem; precocial young • Common diseases: Dental disease, gut stasis Degus • Diurnal, do not hibernate • Highly social, live in colonies and dig burrows • Housing: wire caging, provide tunnelling, nestbox, sufficient bedding to dig, exercise wheel • Will stockpile food • Diet: hay, chinchilla pellets, small amounts leafy greens • Females communally rear young • Common diseases: dental disease","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
