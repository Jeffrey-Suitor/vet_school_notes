Regional vs systemic anatomy The overall function of an organism results from a continuum from the large-scale functions, all the way down to internal cell processes. Systemic anatomy considers each set of organs that function in a related way separately from the other body parts. This is how the DVM1 course mainly divides anatomical studies. • Easier to understand function and dysfunction • Important in diagnosis and prognosis • Misses the effects of their connections to, and integration with, other systems Regional anatomy integrates the body into its whole. • Looks at structures in their normal anatomical position • Divides the body into smaller more manageable chunks or regions • Easier to assess normal vs abnormal • Important in clinical exam and treatment e.g. surgery, injections. While you will need to understand the names for regions now, the study of regional anatomy is primarily DVM2. Body regions Head or cranial Neck or cervical Thoracic Pectoral limb or forelimb Pelvic limb or hindlimb Tail or cauda Rump or gluteal Lumbar Abdomen Body regions – pectoral or forelimb From: König & Liebich. Veterinary Anatomy of Domestic Mammals (1st edition) Shoulder or scapular region Brachial region or brachium Antebrachium Carpus Metacarpus Digital (phalangeal) region Manus Manus = carpus, metacarpus and digits Body regions – pelvic or hindlimb Pes = tarsus, metatarsus and digits Pes Rump or gluteal region Thigh Crus Tarsus Metatarsus Digital (phalangeal) regionFrom: König & Liebich. Veterinary Anatomy of Domestic Mammals (1st edition) Body regions Adapted from: Goody et al. Color Atlas of Veterinary Anatomy, Vol 3 The Dog and Cat. Body cavities Thoracic cavity Cranial to the diaphragm Abdominal cavity Caudal to diaphragm and cranial to pelvic inlet Pelvic cavity Caudal to pelvic inlet Principle to apply with anatomical language 1. Work from the known to the unknown 2. Terms based on Latin and Greek roots (see lecture 4 and the lists on Canvas) • Dissect words to determine their meaning • English also based on these roots, so some word parts will already be familiar 3. Names mostly describe appearance, form, relative position, tissue and/or function 4. Practice is required, as with any language Work from the known to the unknown - what region is it in? - what tissue/organ is it? - what is it connected to/how is it related to its surroundings? - where is it in relation to identifiable skeletal structures? CHECK, CHECK, and CHECK again – try to avoid assuming or guessing. To identify/name an unknown structure: Work from the known to the unknown - What does the name mean? - Identify something nearby that you can relate the structure to that you are certain of - Find a description that tells you where the unknown structure is in relation to that identified structure - If you find an image, does it accurately identify it? - Can you identify anything else that should be related or connected to the unknown structure, to double-check your conclusion? CHECK, CHECK, and CHECK again – try to avoid assuming or guessing. To locate a structure:Take home messages • There are certain terms used to refer to regions of the body. • There are certain terms used to refer to regions within the forelimb and the hindlimb. • The internal body space are is divided by certain landmarks into distinct body cavities • When trying to find a structure, or identify an unknown structure, work from what you know into the unknown by relating to surrounding structures.
