– 500 kg x 1.8% = 9 kg DM OR – 500 kg x 2.0% = 10 kg hay Maximum dry matter intake • How much will a MATURE 500 KG LACTATING Thoroughbred mare eat each day in the first week after giving birth? – 500 kg x 2.7% = 13.5 kg Dry Matter OR – 500 kg x 3.0% = 15 kg hay (dry feed) Maximum dry matter intake • How much will a 300 KG WEANLING Thoroughbred eat each day? – 300 kg x 3.15% = 9.45 kg DM OR – 300 kg x 3.5% = 10.5 kg hay • Notice a 300 kg growing weanling will eat as much or more than a 500 kg horse requires for maintenance Fibre • Fresh grass • Grass hay; lucerne hay • Chaff (oaten; lucerne) • Haylage Fibre requirements • Generally, the MINIMUM requirement to maintain normal caecal & colonic fermentation: – 1 kg DM hay/chaff per 100 kg body weight MINIMUM (or pasture equivalent) BUT REMEMBER – Grain should never form more than 50% of the diet Energy requirements • Maintenance energy requirements for an idle 500 kg horse is: 68 MJ digestible energy/day Energy requirements • Affected by: – Exercise - light x 1.25; mod x 1.5; heavy x 2 – Pregnancy - last 3 mth ONLY; x 1.1 or 1.2 – Lactation - early x 2; late x 1.75 – Growth – x 2+ (varies) • Late pregnancy ≈ light work • Early lactation ≈ heavy work Energy requirements • For 500 kg idle gelding = 68 MJ DE/day • Given ad lib access to hay will eat: 500 x 2% =10 kg hay = 10 x 90%= 9 kg DM • If given full flower lucerne hay @ 9.2 MJ DE/kg DM 9.2 x 9 = 82.8 MJ DE Energy requirements • For 500 kg lactating mare = 135 MJ DE/day • Given ad lib access to hay will eat: 500 x 3% =15 kg hay = 15 x 90%= 13.5 kg DM • If given full flower lucerne hay @ 9.2 MJ DE/kg DM 9.2 MJ DE/kg DM x 13.5 kg DM = 124.2 MJ DE Grain feeding • Starch - good source of energy, BUT: • Digestive capacity of equine SI may be exceeded • Grain should never form more than 50% of the diet • Do not exceed 0.4% bwt /day • ** Always make any diet change gradually ** Cereal grainsGrain processing • Oats (whole) • Oats (rolled) • Barley • Corn (whole) • Corn (cracked) • Corn (extruded) • 83% • 85% • 22% • 45% • 46% • 90% Starch digested in SI • Improves digestibility • Less risk of hindgut fermentation Protein requirement • Relates directly to energy requirement 9.6 g protein/MJ DE (maintenance, exercise and early pregnancy) • Protein in feed expressed as a % DM • Typical sources: – (grass, hay, grains) – Lucerne – Soybean meal; beans; lupins Protein requirement 500 kg idle gelding • 9.6 g x 68 MJ DE = 653 g (0.653 kg) protein daily • 0.653kg protein in 9 kg DM = 7.25% protein 500 kg gelding in hard work • 9.6 g x 136 MJ DE = 1305.6 g protein daily • 1.3056 kg protein in 13.5 kg D • 1.3056/13.5 = 9.8% protein Therefore: • Maintenance /early pregnancy: ~8% • Exercise: ~10% Protein requirement • Protein required per unit energy is increased by: g protein/MJ DE % protein late pregnancy 10.5 11 lactation 12 13 weanling growth 12 14.5 Fats and oils • Concentrated energy (oil = 38 MJ/L) • Alternative energy source to grains • Especially for endurance type exercise • Will tolerate up to ~250ml (1 cup) vegetable oil daily Oilseed grains","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
