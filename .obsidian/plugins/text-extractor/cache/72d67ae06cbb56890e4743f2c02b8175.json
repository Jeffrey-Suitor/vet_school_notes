Table from https://extension.psu.edu/determining-forage-quality-understanding-feed-analysis Average and variation of feed: why test? Extract from https://feedtest.com.au/index.php/about/feedtest-information Plants Types Energy Fibre Protein Forage Fresh Ensiled (silage) Dry • Hay • Paddock • Straw (stubble) Varying content through year Usually higher than hay, cut early Moderate energy/protein Moderate, will degrade over time Low energy/protein Concentrate Seeds e.g. grains Fruits Very high energy & good protein Varies Extensive livestock also occasionally are fed other feed types not used by people or that are out of date etc. to avoid waste e.g. grape marc, brewers grain Variation in quality between categories Need bacteria and protozoa to break these down In SE Australia what does pasture look like throughout the year? Quality low Quantity lowQuality low Quantity high Quality high Quantity low Quality high Quantity high Graph shows available pasture, not growth rate What does this actually look like on farm? • Link to Dookie VR • Not every year is a typical year 2018/19 was a significant rainfall deficiency at Dookie so reduced the expected pasture growth significantly • 2020 was a much improved year but images not yet available on DookieVR How do we measure animal requirements? • The most limiting element of extensive grazing nutrition tends to be energy followed by protein • Energy in ruminant diets is expressed as megajoules of metabolizable energy MJ of ME (or just MJ) • Different sized animals at various stage of their lives will have varying requirements e.g. a 2 year old wether sheep weighing 45 kilogram may require 7.7 MJ ME/day, a late pregnant ewe 12 MJ ME/day, a lactating ewe 18 MJ ME/day, milking dairy cow 170 MJ ME/day, late pregnant beef cow 70 MJ ME/day, etc. How can we simply compare? • We can choose an example animal and use that as a reference point THE DRY SHEEP EQUIVALENT OR DSE In Victoria a DSE is a 2 year old 45kg Merino sheep (wether or non- lactating, non-pregnant ewe) at maintenance = 7.7 MJ of ME Other systems • Some feed program may use an adult equivalent (AE) based on a 450 kg Bos taurus steer at maintenance, 2.25 years of age, walking 7km per day = 72.6 MJ ME/day • Livestock units (LSU) based on 650 kg dairy cow producing 3000kg milk annually = 124.9 MJ ME/day • The above two are examples to demonstrate the range • For beef/sheep material we tend to use the DSE There is always a complication….. • Unfortunately, sheep in NSW are overall a bit larger than Victorian sheep so the NSW version of a DSE is different • In NSW the DSE = a 50kg dry sheep, not 45kg • Hence the DSE MJ for a sheep in NSW is = 9.44 MJ of ME • While we will use the 45 kg Victorian sheep version it is always important to ensure you are talking the same language as there is a substantial difference! We can then turn MJ into DSE for our stockPrimary challenge of extensive animal nutrition • Calculate feed supply average and range over years and how varies from month to month • Utilise this knowledge to design stocking rate, management timing/decisions and purchases/sales of livestock • Some environments may not be suitable to continual stocking or only occasional rotational grazing due to low rainfall/high temperature 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 January February March April May June July August September October November DecemberkgDM/ha Month of year PGR over several years Average PGR Year 1 PGR Year 2 PGR Year 3 PGR Year 4 PGR Year 5 PGR Year 6 PGR Year 7 PGR Pasture growth rate • When is limiting time/s? • In this example – winter maximum routinely limiting • Most summers to early autumn = low growth • An example of where the average can be deceiving 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70kgDM/ha Month of year Average vesus Median PGR Average PGR Median PGR Pasture growth rate varies across regionDecide on the PGR to work with • Attitude to risk • Attitude to longer term climate issues eg drying climate and lesser rainfall potentially shorter growing season but relatively gradual • SE Australia – research has produced equations such as the French equation (and others) to aid calculations of optimal stocking rate (SR) based on rainfall","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
