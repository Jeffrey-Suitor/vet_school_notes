Not infected • Bacteria outside the udder 2. Subclinical • Bacteria inside udder • High ICCC, changes to milk chemistry • Cow fighting an infection 3. Clinical • Obvious Changes to milk • No obvious changes to the cow – (Outside the udder) 4. Toxic • Obvious changes to the cow Types of Mastitis 9 Herd testing (aka “Herd recording”) Processors evaluate bulk milk quality/quantity at each collection Farmers can also monitor individual cows periodically for… • Milk production – Litres – BF (kg and %) – Protein (kg and %) • Individual Cow Cell Count (ICCC) – Subclinical mastitis detection < 50% of Australian herds “herd test”  Control of mastitis Key strategies: • Rapid identification and treatment of clinical cases • Minimising environmental contamination • Minimising spread during milking • Maintaining teat end and teat skin health • Using effective Dry Cow Therapy 10 Rapid identification and treatment of clinical cases Missed cases can quickly elevate BMCC (100,000s!) TARGETS: • No more than 5/100 cows in first 14 days of lactation • No more than 2/100 cows per month in subsequent months of lactation Remove from vat – treat or cull ( if 3 or more cases this lactation) 11 Minimising environmental contamination • Gateways • Water troughs • Laneways and tracks • Dairy entrance • Dairy exit • Feed pads • Calving pads 12 Minimising spread during milking • Maintain milking machines • Vacuum • Pulsation • Rubberware • Avoid under or over milking • Milker HYGIENE (gloves) • Post milking teat disinfection (teat spraying) • Segregate infected cows 13 Teat spraying Incorrect Correct Teat Sealants and Dry Cow Therapy • Teat sealants - seal teat canal at end of lactation • Dry Cow Therapy - Long-acting antibiotic preparation • Infused into each quarter immediately after the last milking for the season • Main actions: o Treats existing infections o Prevents infection during the dry period o Also helps develop keratin plug 15 AEPS – DAIRY WEEK 1 17","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
