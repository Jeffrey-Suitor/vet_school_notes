More recently there has been a greater understanding of the role of the gastric microbiome in disease and neoplasia in humans. While there has not been a clear link described in animals, it is likely the microbiome plays a role in normal homeostasis and the development of disease. In humans it is also widely accepted that gastric neoplasia does arise from a background of chronic inﬂamma�on. Varia�ons in anatomy are important to consider. A squamous por�on of the stomach is present in horses and pigs (as well as some wildlife) and can have diﬀerence suscep�bility to insult. Undiluted gastric secre�on in the dog and cat should be pH <3.0 and abomasal content should be pH <3.5-4.0. The gastric mucosal barrier prevents acid-back diﬀusion and autodiges�on. The integrity relies on the intact surface layer of epithelial cells with �ght junc�ons and the produc�on of the mucus, bicarbonate and hydrophobic phospholipid surface layer. Prostaglandins are important in the protec�on of the gastric mucosa through func�ons including mucous and bicarbonate secre�on, inhibi�on of histamine-s�mulated acid secre�on by parietal cells and inducing prolifera�on of the foveolar mucous epithelium. Diges�ve system: Diseases of the stomach and abomasum 2 Response of the gastric mucosa to injury Res�tu�on Following acute surface damage (erosion or trauma) there is a rapid (minutes) immigra�on of adjacent surface mucosa to cover the defect. This occurs before an inﬂammatory response has been generated. A thick layer of gastric mucus mixed with ﬁbrin and exfoliated cells overlying gastric ulcera�ons forms a protec�ve barrier and encourages res�tu�on. Atrophy of specialised cell types (parietal cells) This typically is associated with chronic disease and is seen as replacement of parietal cells with more primi�ve cells. This condi�on is not no�ceable grossly but is seen microscopically with a change in the cell types present. A condi�on called achlorhydria can result, due to loss of acidic secre�ons which leads to maldiges�on in the lower gastrointes�nal tract. Mucous metaplasia and hyperplasia Develops as a consequence of chronic irrita�on/inﬂamma�on which s�mulates prolifera�on of mucus neck cells with an accompanying loss of parietal cells. The mucosa becomes thickened and o�en nodular. The change can be localised or diﬀuse depending on the cause. Similar to above, achlorhydria can develop followed by disrup�on to the microbiome. One classic example is ostertagiosis in ruminants (see below). Pyloric Stenosis This is a func�onal or anatomic lesion which can be congenital or acquired. Clinically it is associated with delayed gastric emptying. Physical causes can include ulcera�on, granula�on and stricture, polyps, tumours or foreign bodies. In dogs there is a condi�on that has mucosal hypertrophy, smooth muscle hypertrophy or a combina�on of the two that is known as chronic hypertrophic pyloric gastropathy. Mucosal hypertrophy alone is most common. This condi�on is most commonly seen in small-breed dogs. The pathogenesis is poorly understood. Grossly this appears as enlarged mucosal folds surrounding and obstruc�ng the pyloric canal. This condi�on requires full thickness (not endoscopic pinch) biopsies for diagnosis. Gastric impaction Impac�on can occur in horses and catle. Causes include: • Feeding low quality roughage, low water intake or poor mas�ca�on (dental disease) • Pyloric obstruc�on e.g. due to hairballs (trychobezoars similar to those that occur in the rumen) and other foreign material also cause impac�on • Vagal nerve damage (due to pneumonia, pleuri�s or lymphoma) → abnormal gastric mo�lity and emptying (so called vagal indiges�on) In dogs and cats foreign body obstruc�on is more common (hairballs in cats) On post mortem examina�on the condi�on is typically characterised by distended, abnormally packed stomach containing dry ingesta. Gastric dilation and rupture in horses Gastric dila�on can occur as primary or secondary disease. Secondary disease is mostly seen associated with physical obstruc�on of the stomach or intes�ne or colic with ileus. Primary disease occurs most commonly in horses fed with rapidly fermentable carbohydrates (analogous to grain overload in ruminants), lush pasture, or excessive water intake. The ingesta swells due to increased gastric secre�on and saliva. Bacterial fermenta�on of the carbohydrates produces gas and lac�c acid which leads to increased osmo�c pressure and thus an inﬂux of water. Diges�ve system: Diseases of the stomach and abomasum 3 Consequently there is further distension and systemic dehydra�on which can result in shock and death. Animals that do survive can develop lamini�s. Gastric rupture can occur in primary or secondary disease or in some cases can be idiopathic. Peritoni�s develops rapidly due to release of gastric content into the abdominal cavity and usually results in death. On post mortem examina�on, free ingesta is found in the abdominal cavity and the gastric wall is lacerated. Gastric rupture can also occur post mortem. It is important to dis�nguish post mortem from ante mortem rupture. In true ruptures the borders are hyperaemic and haemorrhagic. Gastric dilatation and volvulus (GDV) in dogs This condi�on is a rela�vely common emergency presenta�on in dogs par�cularly in large, deep- chested breeds such as Great Danes, St Bernards, wol�ounds etc. Predisposing factors are controversial but are thought to include laxity of the hepatosplenic ligament, prior splenectomy, diet of small food par�cles, recent kennelling and infec�on with nasal mites inducing ‘reverse sneezing’. The condi�on is associated with overea�ng or ea�ng large meals once daily. Distension of the stomach by food and ﬂuid is compounded by gas accumula�on, possibly from aerophagia. In simple dila�on, the oesophagus is not occluded, and the duodenum is slightly displaced. Whilst the pathogenesis of volvulus is poorly understood it is thought that with mul�ple episodes of gastric dila�on there is stretching and relaxa�on of the gastrohepa�c ligament. Recurrent dila�on, combined with overfeeding, postprandial exercise and perhaps hereditary predisposi�on can result in gastric volvulus. Gastric volvulus results as the stomach rotates clockwise. The stomach is usually rotated clockwise on a ventrodorsal axis when viewed from the ventral abdominal surface. Rota�on is usually 180-360 degrees. The spleen follows the gastrosplenic ligament and ends up in a right ventral posi�on, bent into a “V” shape. htps://cri�calcaredvm.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/52152_orig.jpg Following torsion, there is constric�on of venous ou�low and infarc�on occurs. Grossly the stomach wall is oedematous and dark red to black. The mucosa becomes necro�c and, in some cases, the stomach may rupture. The combina�on of the obstructed veins from the volvulus and pressure from the distended stomach on the portal vein and vena cava results in decreased venous return to the heart, reduced cardiac output and circulatory shock. In addi�on, the increase in intrabdominal pressure can impinge on the diaphragm and compromise respira�on. The gastric volvulus also ini�ates a variety of acid-base and electrolyte abnormali�es which add to the clinical compromise and some�mes disseminated intravascular coagula�on. Decreased portal vein ﬂow can also cause pancrea�c ischemia and, with myocardial necrosis, can cause release of myocardial depressant factor which can trigger cardiac arrythmias. Adult sows can develop gastric volvulus. This is associated with excitement prior to feeding especially in animals fed at long intervals. Diges�ve system: Diseases of the stomach and abomasum 4 Abomasal displacement in ruminants This condi�on most commonly develops in high producing, intensively managed dairy cows but can be present in pasture fed animals. Normally the abomasum lies over the xyphoid process at the abdominal ventral midline (transverse along ventral body wall). Displacement leads to par�al disrup�on of abomasal ou�low. The sequestra�on of chloride in the abomasum and subsequent metabolic alkalosis is part of the associated clinical syndrome. Le�-sided abomasal displacement (LDA) is most common and is a generally non- fatal en�ty of high- producing dairy catle during the 6 weeks following parturi�on. The abomasum shi�s ventrally and to the le� of the rumen. In the post-calving period, abomasal atony can occur as a result of heavy grain feeding and hypocalcaemia. Many aﬀected animals have concurrent problems, including ketosis, hypocalcemia, metri�s, and retained placenta. Right-sided displacement (RDA) is less common (15% of cases) and can occur in post- parturient dairy cows and calves. Approximately 20% of these cases can progress to abomasal torsion which is clinically more serious. Similar to GDV in dogs, catle with abomasal torsion can develop signiﬁcant electrolyte disturbances (mostly metabolic alkalosis) and progress to ischemic necrosis and rupture. Gastric inflammation (gastritis, abomasitis) Gastri�s is a term used broadly both clinically and in pathology that reﬂects a wide variety of insults on the stomach. Disease can be acute or chronic. Acute gastri�s can be seen grossly as mucosal sloughing, ulcera�on, oedema, haemorrhage, hyperaemia, excess mucus and some�mes with the presence of parasites or foreign bodies. Clinical signs that accompany acute gastri�s = vomi�ng, anterior abdominal pain, saliva�on, +/- diarrhoea. Chronic gastri�s can be seen as knobby, irregular and thickened rugal folds +/- abscesses or granulomas. Chronic gastri�s results in changes to mucosa such as atrophy of specialized cells, including parietal and chief cells, and mucous cell hyperplasia and achlorhydria can develop. In dogs, horses and pigs, chronic gastri�s may lead to a condi�on known as hypertrophic gastritis. Causes include gastric parasi�sm, lymphocy�c-plasmacy�c gastri�s and food allergy. Causes of gastritis Infec�ous causes of gastri�s are rela�vely uncommon in dogs and cats. Chronic inﬂamma�on is much more common and is associated with food allergies or is considered idiopathic (ie. part of idiopathic inﬂammatory bowel disease). Bacterial, fungal and viral infec�ons do occur in ruminants however are o�en part of a systemic disease process (viral) or secondary to other underlying disease (fungal). Braxy • Clostridium septicum infec�on (gram-posi�ve bacilli) • Acute abomasi�s in sheep and less commonly catle • The cause is poorly understood but the disease generally occurs in cold weather and is thought to arise associated with mechanical trauma to the abomasal mucosa • There is bacterial exotoxin produc�on and death due to toxaemia. The toxins cause severe �ssue damage, increase capillary permeability and �ssue necrosis which facilitates spread of the infec�on • Grossly there is mucosal and submucosal oedema and haemorrhage. There can also be signiﬁcant gas forma�on by the bacteria (fermenta�on) giving rise to submucosal emphysema Viral abomasi�s Diges�ve system: Diseases of the stomach and abomasum 5 • Abomasi�s is rarely the sole lesion, more commonly it is just one of many lesions associated with the infec�on • Examples include: infec�ous bovine rhinotrachei�s in calves and, rarely, older animals, herpesviral infec�ons of small ruminants, bovine viral diarrhea, malignant catarrhal fever, and bluetongue. Myco�c gastri�s/abomasi�s • Generally occurs as a secondary disease where there is already underlying achlorhydria, atrophy, necrosis or ulcera�on • There may also be compromised resistance with endotoxemia, sep�cemia, endogenous or exogenous steroids, neoplasia, viral disease, and altered gastrointes�nal ﬂora caused by an�bio�c therapy • Most commonly infec�on is with the zygomycetes (phycomycetes) such as Rhizopus, Absidia, or Mucor; rarely, Aspergillus • Fungal hyphae inﬁltrate the submucosa typically invade venules and arterioles, causing thrombosis and hemorrhagic infarc�on • Grossly lesions are of mucosal necrosis with surface haemorrhage and haemorrhage and oedema in the submucosa Chemical injury • Causes acute gastri�s • Grossly seen as diﬀuse gastric conges�on, haemorrhage, necrosis, ulcera�on, oedema. • Causes include arsenic, phospha�c fer�lizers, various plants, heavy metals, dishwashing powder, metaldehyde, and blister beetles/cantharidin toxicity(horses) Non-steroidal inﬂammatory drugs (NSAIDS) • NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin produc�on thus removes their protec�ve eﬀects of the gastric mucosa • There is reduced bicarbonate and mucus produc�on leading to mucosal erosion and ulcera�on Lymphoplasmacy�c gastri�s/gastroenteri�s This is a common diagnosis in dogs and cats which is believed to arise as an idiopathic reac�on to a range of intraluminal an�gens with food and/or bacterial allergens o�en being implicated. There is currently no direct associa�on with infec�on by Helicobacter spp. in domes�c animals other than in the ferret (see further comments below). Uraemia • Occasionally seen in dogs, cats and horses due to renal failure • Grossly there is red-black discoloura�on of the mucosa due to severe conges�on, with associated haematemesis and melena. Mineral deposi�on may be seen if it is severe enough • Histologically there is mineral deposi�on in the basement membranes of vessels, glands and degenera�ve smooth muscle • Mineral deposi�on is associated with calcium imbalance. Uraemic toxins also cause vascular endothelial damage leading to oedema, thrombosis and mucosal ischemic damage. Helicobacter-associated gastri�s Diges�ve system: Diseases of the stomach and abomasum 6 Helicobacter spp. are a spirochete bacteria and are the most common cause of gastri�s and ulcera�on in humans (Helicobacter pylori). Furthermore, infec�on with H. pylori in humans is considered a risk factor for the development of gastric neoplasia. In dogs and cats, iden�ﬁed Helicobacter spp include: H. heilmannii, H. cania and H. felis. The role Helicobacter spp. in gastric disease in domes�c animals is not proven. Described pathology associated with Helicobacter infec�ons ranges from the presence of organisms in the absence of no�ceable mucosal injury to severe gastric disease characterised by mixed mucosal inﬂamma�on, erosions and ulcera�ons. Such diﬀerences in gastric pathology may be inﬂuenced by the Helicobacter species and strain and the mammalian host or may indicate a lack of causa�on of Helicobacter in gastric ulcera�on of domes�c animals. One excep�on amongst the domes�c species is the ferret where H. mustelae has been shown to be causal of lymphoplasmacy�c gastri�s. Gastri�s in cheetah has been associated with Helicobacter infec�on. Gastric and abomasal ulcers An ulcer is a mucosal defect in which the en�re mucosal thickness, down to or through the basement membrane, has been lost. Penetra�on through the remaining �ssue layers to the peritoneal cavity is termed perfora�ng ulcer. In comparison an erosion results in par�al-thickness mucosal damage. Ulcers can be acute or chronic. Acute ulcers have associated hyperaemia (redness). Chronic ulcers lack this redness and have a thickened, ﬁrm rim of ﬁbrosis around the periphery. Gastric ulcers occur in dogs, cats, horses, catle and pigs. The pathogenesis of gastroduodenal ulcers in animals is incompletely understood. Stress is believed to play a role. Pathogenesis of gastric ulcers The primary underlying mechanism is likely to be impairment of mucosal integrity in the face of normal acid secre�on. This imbalance is a result of the following: • Local disturbance or trauma to the epithelium • Back ﬂush of bile acids from duodenum • Mechanical trauma (foreign bodies etc) • High gastric acidity • Gastrinomas (Zollinger-Ellsion syndrome) or mast cell tumours (histamine release) can lead to gastric acid hypersecre�on • Local disturbances in blood ﬂow resul�ng in ischemia • Stress • NSAIDS or endogenous or exogenous steroids • Inhibi�on of prostaglandin leading to vasoconstric�on and reduced mucous produc�on • NSAIDS can also promote gastric hypermo�lity which alters vascular blood ﬂow and decreased mucosal response to injury • Phenylbutazone may also have a direct toxic eﬀect on vascular endothelium in the mucosa Diges�ve system: Diseases of the stomach and abomasum 7 Perfora�on of gastric ulcers results in massive abdominal haemorrhage and/or release of gastric contents into the abdomen and a fatal peritoni�s. Equine gastric ulcera�on Due to its complicated and mul�factorial nature, the term equine gastric ulcer syndrome (EGUS) has been used to describe this disease. There are two main disease subsets: Foals most commonly have ulcera�on in the squamous por�on of the stomach but can develop in the glandular por�on if NSAIDs have been administered. Adult horses commonly have ulcera�on in the squamous por�on of the stomach. Gastric ulcers occur in 40% to 90% of compe��ve and performance horses, especially thoroughbreds. The most severe ulcers occur in those animals that are worked the hardest. Proposed causes of ulcera�on of the non-glandular mucosa include: • fas�ng o hay and saliva protect the gastric mucosa • intense exercise o increased abdominal pressure leads to prolonged exposure of the non- glandular mucosa to acid o exercise can have inhibitory eﬀect on gastric emptying Gastric ulcers in the glandular mucosa of adult horses are mainly associated with NSAIDS administra�on. Porcine gastric ulcera�on Ulcera�on is common in the stomach of pigs and usually restricted to pars oesophagea. htps://open.lib.umn.edu/swinedisease/chapter/gastric-ulcers/ Dr. Carlos Pijoan Weaners and growers are more suscep�ble to gastric ulcers and the disease is associated with stress and diet formula�on (ﬁnely ground grain). Other associa�ons include slated ﬂooring and high carbohydrate foods. In pigs, the typical preceding lesion in the gastric mucosa is hyperkeratosis of the pars oesophagea, which then erodes and an ulcer develops. Acute hemorrhage can result in severe acute blood loss and death. These pale, anaemic pigs are some�mes described as ‘porcelain pigs’. Bovine abomasal ulcera�on Abomasal ulcers are common in catle while duodenal ulcers are rare. In calves, ulcers are associated with: • dietary changes and mechanical irrita�on of the abomasum with roughage • stress also is a contribu�ng factor In adult dairy catle ulcers are associated with: • heavy grain feeding (lac�c acidosis) at the �me of parturi�on • displacement of the abomasum • viral infec�on (BVD (pes�virus), malignant catarrhal fever (herpesvirus)) • impac�on Diges�ve system: Diseases of the stomach and abomasum 8 Grossly, they present as linear brown, black haemorrhagic areas along margins of the rugae, primarily in pyloris and can measure up to 15 cm in diameter. Ulcers should be considered where there is anaemia and/or melena, and perfora�on suspected where there are signs of sep�c peritoni�s. Canine gastric ulcera�on Gastric ulcera�on is clinically associated with variable appe�te, abdominal pain, vomi�on, melena and anaemia. Ulcers are usually found in the pyloric antrum and proximal duodenum. Causes include: • Dermal mast cell tumours • release histamine into the blood stream which binds to receptors on parietal cells increasing HCl secre�on. • Gastrinomas (pancreas or duodenum) • secre�on of gastrin increases secre�on of HCl (so called Zollinger- Ellison syndrome). • NSAIDS • Inhibi�on of prostaglandins leads to vasoconstric�on and reduced mucus produc�on thus reduced integrity of the mucosal barrier • Trauma • Physical loss of the epithelium • Uraemia • Damage to endothelial cells leading to vascular compromise + increased ammonia secre�on and caus�c injury = necrosis Parasitic diseases of the stomach Gastric parasi�c infec�ons are an uncommon cause of gastri�s in dogs and cats. In contrast they are the cause of signiﬁcant disease in ruminants. Cattle, sheep and goats Haemonchus contortus/H. placei • Large, abomasal blood-sucking nematode parasites capable of causing severe anaemia and hypoproteinaemia • Egg hatch in pasture and moult 3 �mes to L3 larvae which is infec�ous when eaten. Larvae survive for some �me on pasture par�cularly in cool condi�ons • The parasites have high fecundity, a short life cycle and high degree of gene�c varia�on which means that they can make rapid adap�ve changes and poten�ally rapidly develop resistance to drenches • In cold weather larvae undergo hypobiosis (arrested development) and resume developing once condi�ons are warmer. This important in “spring rise” disease onset where ewes are more suscep�ble under the stress of late pregnancy and parturi�on • Engorged females have a ‘barbers pole’ appearance with the red blood in their intes�nal tract wrapping around their white genital tract • Gross lesions are of severe oedema (botle jaw) and pallor from anaemia Ostertagia spp Diges�ve system: Diseases of the stomach and abomasum 9 • Catle: Ostertagia ostertagi and O. lyrate • Sheep and goats: Teladorsagia circumcincta • Very important cause of diarrhoea, ill thri� and death in grazing ruminants in temperate regions. • Causes protein loss with diarrhoea • Has a Direct lifecycle. o 3rd stage larva (L3) ingested and invade abomasal glands Type I ostertagiasis  direct development to L5 leading to disease Type II ostertagiasis  hypobiosis of L4 in glands • The larvae damage mucosa leading to inﬂamma�on and mucous neck cell hyperplasia and metaplasia • Adults live on the mucosal surface • Gross changes are of a markedly thickened mucosa which is inﬂamed with raised, pale nodular lesions, o�en with a slightly depressed centre (= larval stages in glands). o The merging nodules are described as “Morocco leather” patern or cobblestone patern to the irregularly thickened mucosa. Bovine abomasal ostertagiasis htps://wellcomecollec�on.org/works/zvr2gpx9 • Pathogenesis: Parietal cells replaced by mucous neck cells (mucous cell metaplasia)  decreased HCl secre�on (achlorhydria) increased abomasal pH (up to 7 or more)  Pepsinogen not converted to pepsin (due to incr. pH)  decreased protein diges�on (hypoproteinemia)  bacterial overgrowth in intes�ne  diarrhea Blood gastrin increases as body tries to s�mulate acid secre�on (hypergastrinemia)  central eﬀect on sa�ety center and decreased GI mo�lity  decreased appe�te Gastri�s  increased vascular permeability  leaky junc�ons between hyperplas�c mucous cells  protein loss into abomasum • Clinically: loss of appe�te; diarrhea; was�ng • Clinical pathology: hypoproteinaemia; achlorhydria; increased plasma pepsinogen Trichostrongylus axei • Occurs in ruminant and horses • It has a direct lifecycle • The parasites live in intra-epithelial tunnels in mucosa which leads to mucous metaplasia and hyperplasia of glands with subsequent protein loss and achlorhydria. • Grossly the stomach is thickened with nodules or folds of mucosa + erosions and it is covered in thick mucus. Horses Draschia megastoma Diges�ve system: Diseases of the stomach and abomasum 10 • Burrows into submucosa along margo plicatus forming large nodules or pouches of granulomatous inﬂamma�on containing worms Habronema majus, H. muscae • Parasites on mucosal surface Gasterophilus spp (Fly larvae or bots) • Very common! • Life Cycle: ﬂies lay eggs on hairs which are licked by the horse and they hatch and develop as larvae in stomach • The parasites may cause small erosions and ulcers, but infec�on is generally asymptoma�c Trichostrongylus axei – see above Pigs Hyostrongylus rubidus • Clinical signs are usually absent in light infec�ons but heavy infec�ons can lead to decreased appe�te, weight loss, and anemia • Infec�ons are primarily conﬁned to animals reared outdoors • Larval hypobiosis can occur Gastric neoplasia Gastric neoplasia is rela�vely rare in dogs and cats. The stomach is the most common site for gastrointes�nal neoplasia in horses. Adenocarcinoma This tumour is most common in dogs ~ 10 years of age. They are considered rare in other species. Adenomas are also uncommon. Over 50% of adenocarcinomas occur in the pyloric region. Grossly they are variable in appearance; some are prolifera�ve and protrude into the lumen, others a large, ulcerated crater while others are localised, plaque-like thickenings. Most incite a scirrhous reac�on which is a ﬁrm ﬁbrous �ssue component. Canine gastric adenocarcinomas also have high metasta�c poten�al, with nodal metastases reported in around 70% of dogs at diagnosis. Distant metastases are observed in 15–70% of dogs at diagnosis, with metastases most common in the liver, spleen, lung, and adrenal glands. Squamous cell carcinomas These tumours most commonly occur in middle-aged horses in the squamous por�on of the stomach. Grossly these tumours appear as cauliﬂower-like masses projec�ng from the mucosal surface. Equine gastric SCCs can cause hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia, most likely due to paraneoplas�c produc�on of PTH-rp. If they extend through to the serosal surface they can ‘seed’ throughout the peritoneal cavity. The tumour can also spread directly to liver, spleen and diaphragm and can metastasis to the liver or lung. Lymphoma Gastric lymphoma occurs most commonly in cats, catle and dogs. In catle the abomasum is a common site for lymphoma associated with enzoo�c bovine leukosis. Grossly the neoplas�c cell inﬁltrates can develop as a diﬀuse thickening however some cases appear more nodule. Both T and B lymphocyte variants occur. Diges�ve system: Diseases of the stomach and abomasum 11 Spindle cell tumours Spindle cell tumours can arise from the wall of the stomach. They can be either leiomyomas/sarcomas or gastrointes�nal stromal tumours (GISTs) which arise from the inters��al cells of Cajal. These tumour types can only be diﬀeren�ated on immunohistochemistry. These appear as ﬁrm, pale masses within the wall of the stomach. Both gastric leiomyosarcomas and GISTs have been reported to metastasize. Neuroendocrine tumours (Gastric carcinoid) These tumours are derived from enteroendocrine cells. They are rela�vely rare and are more likely to develop in proximal parts of the stomach. While func�on tumours exist in humans, none have been described in domes�c animals. While some of these tumors are well diﬀeren�ated and locally expansile, metastasis has been described in domes�c animals. Additional Reading Head. K.W. et al.
