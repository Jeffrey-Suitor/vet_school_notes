In addition, you will begin to build on those activities at your instructors discretion and depending on your level of confidence. Suggested activities and progressions are listed here: • Use of the crush: now you will be asked to catch a cow as they walk into the crush. • Approaching the cow in the crush: o From the side to palpate the paralumbar fossa and over the ribs where you might hear the heart with a stethoscope (can you identify other external anatomical features and areas such as the hip bones or withers) o From behind to take a temperature, observe anatomy of the hind end of the cow (can you recognise the pin bones, tail folds, anus, vulva?) • Putting a halter on a cow in a crush o Now, once you have put the halter on, restrain the head of the cow using the halter so that their ear tag can be read easily and safely * • Moving cows from yards down the race and into the crushes • Moving a small group of cows from one yard to another o You may now be asked to draft out a few cows from the group rather than moving all of them. Preparation: • Now that you have seen cows in action, review the material about cow behaviour, points of balance and flight zones from the CLA (links below) – did you recognise these behaviours in the cows you worked with during the last session? • https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7B2-M14YAs (3 mins) • https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwu8NcrI0z0 (4 mins) • https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlhfpfKYwmA (2 mins) • https://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/system/files/documents/1702/general- guide-cattle-handling.pdf Particularly pages 6-11. Remember at all times: • Work quietly and calmly around the animals • Always touch the cow lightly and talk to it from a distance to let her know you are there before moving your body within striking distance. • Be aware of your own safety, the safety of your colleagues and the wellbeing of the cattle 3 Animal Handling Introduction - Cattle • Watch this video: Catching a cow in a crush: https://echo360.net.au/media/0860c9e8-2295-42fd-bddf- b870bd26aa91/public • Review the information in the identification of external landmarks simulator activity if you don’t remember all the terms that might be used to describe parts of the cow on farm: External landmark identification - cattle *Securely restraining the head of a cow with a halter for examination or other procedures can be done either by someone holding the halter or by tying the end of the halter to the crush using a quick release knot. Please: o ask a demonstrator for help o review the knot-tying simulator activity for quick release knots here: Knot tying o remember the following points:  Secure the end of the halter to the crush at about the neutral level of the cow’s head or slightly higher for most routine purposes.  If the end of the halter is to be held manually, wrap it around a rail of the crush a couple of times to give greater security  ALWAYS use a quick release knot when tying a halter – if the animal goes down in the crush, the halter needs to be released quickly so that they are not left hanging from their head.  ***Even when the cow’s head is restrained in this manner, be careful not to put your own head in a position where it could be hit by the cow if the halter comes loose***","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
