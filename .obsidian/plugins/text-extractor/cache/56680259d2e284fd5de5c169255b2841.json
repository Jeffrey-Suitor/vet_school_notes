During this lecture we will discuss how and why we need to manage the following aspects of the captive environment. • Heat mosaic, preferred body temperatures and preferred optimal temperature zones • Light : Visible and UVB • Humidity • Facilitating normal behaviours – Enrichment – Housing ratios – Enclosure size and design Hygiene • Diet Providing comfort for reptiles • Heat mosaic • Light : Visible and UVB • Humidity • Hygiene • Facilitating normal behaviours • Enrichment • Housing ratios • Enclosure size and design • Diet Diagram from website haapets Heat requirements • Reptiles are ectothermic • PBT:Preferred Body Temperature varies for every body function • POTZ:Preferred Optimal Temperature Zone varies between taxa/species • Heat source preferences vary between taxa. Providing and controlling heat • Globes: coloured, infrared, ceramic • Heat mats: geckos, low level back ground heat • Water heaters: 1 amp per litre • Thermostats and thermometers needed • Globe wattage, tank insulation and ventilation affect temp mosaic • Monitor behaviour as well as gauges • Prevent burns Light requirements • Visible light spectrum intensity and colour preferences vary between species. • Daily cycle allows for rest. Ultraviolet light • UVA,B and C • UVA debate • UVB essential for chelonians, lizards other than geckos, crocodiles Providing light • Visible light provided by some heat globes and all UV globes. • Colour type preferences for some taxa • Light/dark cycle • Necessary for mental health and normal behaviour • 12/12 all year • seasonal variation Providing ultraviolet light UVB wavelength 280-315nm • 30cm or less from basking area • Change globe every 6 months • Full spectrum is visible UVA spectrum only • Fluorescent, mercury vapour, compact UVB • Blocked by glass and plastic Humidity and water • Humidity % varies between taxa • Enclosure humidity affects hydration, hygiene, health of skin, lungs and gut and behaviour • Some reptiles drink from containers, others from foliage or misting • Too much access to water can be as unhealthy as too little for some taxa A: Mesh lid B: Heat lamp C: UV B tube D: Thermometer and hygrometer E: artificial plants F: Hide G: Water bowl H: Perche I: Substrate J: Heat mat Providing water/controlling humidity • Very wide taxa variations Low humidity: Small water bowl at cool end, rare bathing and misting, dry substrates, excellent drainage. High humidity: Large shallow water source near heat, foliage, frequent misting, bathing allowed • Good ventilation essential for both Space requirements • Enough space to stretch out, climb or swim and to behave normally • Enable retreat from companions • Designed to provide an appropriate temperature mosaic • Arboreal, terrestrial, aquatic • Coinhabitants/sex ratios Squamate (lizards and snakes) enclosure Vivarium • Glass, wood, acrylic, mesh • Consider insulating qualities of materials and absorbency. • Size for snakes should allow them to stretch to full length across the diagonal • Aboreal tanks tall, terrestrial long • Greater heat mosaic range in longer tanks Aquatic tanks/pools • Chelonians, crocodiles, water monitors, some dragons • Basking or land area appropriate for species, UVB and heat above it • Water heater (1amp per litre for effective heating) and thermostat • Filtration: external cannisters most effective • Water quality monitoring A: Mesh lid B: Heat lamp C: UV B tube D: Thermometers/heating rod E: artificial plants F: Filters G: Aerator H: Hide/dock I: Substrate Substrates and furnishings Substrates • Consider hygiene, thermal properties, absorbancy, abrasiveness • Turf, newspaper, commercial litters, stones, slate tiles, bark, sand, tubs of litter Furnishings • Logs, rocks, tiles, plants, artificial works • Hides, burrows, screening Facilitating normal behaviours • Nocturnal, crepuscular or diurnal? • Housing ratios • Hides and camouflage • Burrowing and digging • Climbing • Thermoregulating and basking • Bathing • Ecdysis Handling and socialising • Handling reptiles usually takes them out of their POTZ • “Socialising” with mammalian carnivores is usually stressful • Being under constant surveillance by us or other pets is very stressful • Vibrations through their tanks also cause stress Enrichment • Change tank furnishings and plants • Don’t overcrowd tank furnishings as it can make basking and movement difficult • Spartan tanks are easy to clean but provide poor enrichment • Vary substrates provided • Beware mite contamination if using natural furnishings or recycling from other tanks. Diet • Snakes: whole prey, never live prey • Chelonians: Tortoises are terrestrial and herbivores. Turtles are aquatic. Fresh water turtles eat invertebrates with varying proportions of plants. • Lizards: Very wide range of dietary niches • Crocodiles: Carnivores Whole prey diets • It is illegal to feed live vertebrate prey – Rodents, rabbits, poultry – Snakes and large carnivorous lizards • Live invertebrates and fish may be fed • The quality of the diet is only as good as the quality of the raising of the prey items Invertebrate and veg diet • Crickets, woodies, mealworms, snails, earthworms, slaters, millipedes, moths, flies (wild caught and cultured) • Variety of invertebrates is best • Chopped leafy greens • Pieces of hard vegetables like carrot and sweet potato are good for teeth Supplements • Calcium carbonate (every invertebrate feed) • Vitamin D3 • Multivitamins (once weekly) • Method of delivery affects intake – Dust just before feeding out – Dusting no use for aquatic feeders – Feed out small numbers of inverts – Gut loading ensures delivery but kills inverts faster Hygiene Aquatic • Water quality monitoring – Nitrogen cycle, water hardness, pH • Filtration–in tank versus external, under gravel • Partial water changes Vivarium • Daily spot cleaning,3-6 monthly scrub F10 • Mite prevention and treatment Tank set up considerations • Ectotherms with individual POTZs – Heat source management, basking opportunities, insultation, ventilation • Light (Visible and UVB) – UVB globe type, position, age of globe – Day length • Humidity – water source, misting, furnishings, ventilation Enrichment and disease prevention • Hygiene – Humidity, cleaning, substrate management – Mite prevention • Handling – Time out of tank, comfort with being handled • Appropriate diet and delivery of food items • Housing ratios • Monitor equipment and behaviour","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
