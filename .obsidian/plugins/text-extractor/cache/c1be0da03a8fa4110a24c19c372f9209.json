Industry videos to introduce intensive ruminants • Range of different production systems for ruminants managed intensively • Can be temporary (containment pens during dry period/drought or for very wet period e.g. dairy) or longer term (feedlot) • In some environments a roof is vital, depends on temperature and precipitation • Feed types vary between countries, often includes food left over from human processing e.g. dry distillers grain (DDG), grape marc etc • Animals come from extensive ruminant systems (revise semester 1) What types of production systems? • Dairy ‐ cattle ‐ goat ‐ sheep • Meat ‐ cattle ‐ sheep ‐ goats • Fibre ‐ sheep (Sharlea – name comes from original property) ‐ goats Back to our question? • Why would you manage ruminants intensively? 1. Animal health – removes parasites such as nematodes from the equation 2. Can allow harvest of feed from range of places where ruminants may not be allowed to graze (such as small dairies in countries such as Nepal) 3. Improves feed conversion ratio, reduces methane production per kilogram growth (in future may also reduce CH4 production using seaweed etc) 4. Provides regular growth rate and quality control in final meat/milk/fibre production as get routine nutrition and reduces high/low environment issues if in covered area 5. Short term – need feed at shows or various exhibitions as lack of grass 6. Containment zone – reduce damage to paddocks during dry period, maintains stock welfare, allows regular monitoring 7. Other 1.Parasite control • Why would you manage ruminants intensively? • Milking goats in sheds are common • Cut and carry for pasture • Removes nematode parasites from the system • Cut and carry may be combined with other feeds • Higher $ per kg DM • Health issues • Reproduction easier • Less walking needed • Greater biosecurity management 2. Feed harvest elsewhere • Smallholder farms may keep animals in a feedlot like scenario and do a cut and carry operation similar to the previous goat example • Access grass in neighbouring areas using manual labour • Livestock may not be able to graze in these areas (remember semester 1 case study in Myanmar) 3. Improve feed conversion ratio (FCR), reduce CH4 • Ruminant FCR improves on a feedlot ration – ruminant FCR tends to range from 4.5‐7.5 (more variable on forage based extensive grazing diets) • Depending on genetics and feed type FCR may even be better than this e.g. needing less than 4.5kg DM feed to put on 1 kg bodyweight • Feed conversion ratio varies according to genetics, nutrition, environment and other factors • Generally higher FCR in a feedlot scenario • Less animal movement • Manage environment Liveweight gain per day Extract from https://futurebeef.com.au/knowledge‐centre/beef‐cattle‐feedlots‐feed‐consumption‐and‐liveweight‐gain/ Impact of some seaweed on methane • Found that certain types of seaweed produce metabolites that may decrease methane production (burping) • More research to demonstrate benefits and also mechanism for producing seaweed in quantity and feeding • Ability to add to daily requirement in feedlot compared extensive https://www.future‐feed.com/how‐it‐works 4. Quality assurance • Most supermarkets and large retailers take beef cattle through feedlots prior to sending to abattoir • Ensures consistent growth as they receive consistent diet compared to grass fed which may vary significantly • Usually 60‐90 days on grain for domestic market, manage as single group (not mixed) Meat Standards Australia https://www.mla.com.au/marketing‐beef‐and‐lamb/meat‐standards‐australia/msa‐beef/ 5. Intensive feed at shows/events • For holding stock for more than a day generally using feed/water in pens 6. Containment zone • Containment zone used when feed is limiting on property – primary summer/autumn but potentially winter also • Potentially secondary use as on‐farm feedlot for prime stock • Design/size varies with species and regularity of use • Must be able to supply roughage and grain base diet, or have troughs where can supply output from mixer wagon or similar https://agriculture.vic. gov.au/farm‐ management/land‐ and‐pasture‐ management/stock‐ containment‐areas‐ for‐emergencies#h2‐0 7. Other • Range of other reasons for producers bringing livestock into feedlot or containment (floods, fires etc) Intensive ruminant management • Pre‐induction (backgrounding) • Induction • Feeding • Turn‐off/turn‐out • For enterprises that are permanently intensive such as a dairy feedlot, this uses many of the management factors discussed last semester Backgrounding • Preparing stock to later be managed in feedlot/confinement • Yard weaning • Ideally straight from property to background/feedlot (not mixed) • Background cohort on property in feedlot group before arrival • Relevant vaccines prior to feedlot entry so already have immunity before stress and acclimitisation • Improve • Socialisation • Feed intake • Health (less disease)‐ particularly respiratory disease • Some enterprises specialise in background stock for feedlots Backgrounding • Some feedlots pay producers a per kilogram rate to manage cattle in groups pre feedlot entry • One program shown on right • Avoid capital outlay for producer https://www.mortco.com.au/backgrounding‐profit‐share Induction • Quarantine • Collection LPA NVD information and Vendor Declaration • Record NLIS details • Clean water and fresh roughage (mostly use hay) • HGP +/‐ • Kept in group or drafted into group – same weight, age, sex, target market/weight • Vaccination/anthelmintic & often additional eartag • IPM to control flies (feedlot) • May include shearing/wigging/crutching for sheep • =Needed for feedlot but not containment (HGP only beef) Parasite control • Internal parasites • Nematodes • Trematodes (primarily liver fluke) • Cestodes • External parasites • Lice • Flies • Mites • Ticks • Range of options – Pour‐on, injection & oral Vaccine • Exact vaccine used depends on species • Generally 5 in 1 used, except 7 in 1 likely in intensive dairy for both livestock and people (Leptospirosis is a zoonosis), 6 in 1 potentially sheep containment zone • Also may use vaccine against respiratory disease e.g. BRD– bacterial and/or viral • Potentially pinkeye vaccine • Ideally use in pre‐feedlot period so that immune response present prior to arrival at feedlot From APHIS, Info Sheet, April 2013 Adapting to intensive diet • The routine diet in intensive feeding predominantly consists of grain due to its lower cost c/MJ • However introduction to the feedlot commences with primarily roughage and gradually builds up the grain component over the first few weeks to month • The final diet will depend on the required growth rate and end market • For containment feeding it will be about meeting maintenance while for a feedlot it is about performance (milk/meat) VETS30032 / VETS90127 Animals in Intensive Production Systems Feeding types and budgets Dr Stuart Barber srbarber@unimelb.edu.au An example feed budget • Note that labour is not included in this budget, important to recognise this cost somewhere • Assume feed cost includes depreciation etc on yards and costs to feed ie.

Geoff Duddy and Chris Shands Grain introduction https://futurebeef.com.au/knowledge‐centre/managing‐beef‐cattle‐feedlots/ Bunk space per head • The table below demonstrates bunk space required per animal in a beef feedlot • These requirements are in place to ensure all animals are able to access feed without bullying • For sheep in a feedlot fed ad lib 3 cm required per head, on lower feed rations up to 30cm per head needed https://futurebeef.com.au/knowledge‐centre/managing‐beef‐cattle‐feedlots/ Types of feeds • Grains • Roughage • Vitamin/Mineral VETS30032 / VETS90127 Animals in Intensive Production Systems Feedlot welfare Dr Stuart Barber srbarber@unimelb.edu.au Feedlot welfareTools to assess heat load index risk • Heat load is one of the biggest potential issues around feedlots • Fat animals almost ready for slaughter often at most risk, particularly if dark colour • Shade • Wind Stock inspection • Pen riders • Regular stock inspection by trained observers • Animal health (particularly BRD) • Remove any sick animals early Extract from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y0KtZZl‐z0","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
