Release of molecules 2. Membrane bound molecules Neurotransmitters (wired networks) Hormones (broadcast) Local mediators (shouting) Immune system (Cellular neighbours) AO Exosomes? http://www.umm.uni- heidelberg.de/inst/cbtm/mbio/research/exosomes.html Exosomes/Extracellular vesicles 500 nm Extracellular vesicles shuffling intercellular messages: for good or for bad. Lo Cicero A, Stahl PD, Raposo G. Curr Opin Cell Biol. 2015;35:69-77 Communicators Diagnostic biomarkers? Therapeutics? Autacoids • Diverse group of (patho)physiological mediators. • Often considered as defense mediators - formation and release associated with infection and inflammation. • Are important therapeutic targets. • Modulatory Functions – Smooth muscle tone/length – Glandular secretion – Permeability (vascular & airway) – Sensory nerves (pain & itch) Autacoids • Autacoid- ‘Self Remedy’ • Multiple interacting mediators that include: – Histamine – Bradykinin – Eicosanoids • Prostaglandins • Leukotrienes • Why do they usually only act locally? – Often quite labile or are rapidly broken down close to their site of release. Histamine • Largely stored in and released from: – Mast cells (tissues- particularly mucosal surfaces/skin) – Basophils (blood) • Enterochromaffin-like cells (GIT) – regulate stomach acid secretion • (Also peripheral and central histaminergic neurones.) Janeway et al; Immunobiology 5th edition; Fig. 9.35 The Age.com.au Mast Cells and Histamine www.imperial.ac.ukwww.mendsstreetpharmacy.com.au www.heraldsun.com.au AO Histamine • Mediates its activities through interacting with 4 distinct receptors- H1, H2, H3 & H4 • All are GPCRs. • Therapies – H1R antagonism- allergic disease (mainly) – H2R antagonism- peptic ulcer disease (and related conditions) – H3R antagonism- narcolepsy – H4R antagonism- none approved yet (pruritus?) H1 Receptor Antagonists- ‘Antihistamines’ • Competitive, reversible antagonists of H1 receptors • Useful in treating: – Hayfever (allergic rhinitis) – Atopic dermatitis (adjunct to glucocorticoids) – Urticaria – Anaphylaxis & angiodema (adjunct to adrenaline) – Bites & stings H2 Receptor Antagonists • Were revolutionary in the treatment of peptic ulcers – “Blockbuster drugs” – Cimetidine/Ranitidine • Improved understanding of the condition have led to alternative methods of treating peptic ulcers Chorus For it's mine, for it's mine, Decarboxylated Histidine, We've extracted you and weighed you, By the living gut assayed you, But we've yet to find your function - Histamine!

Bioactive Component in Semen • Contraction (or relaxation) of the uterus observed during artificial insemination. • In vitro/vivo studies- contraction of smooth muscle and reduction of blood pressure demonstrated when semen/reproductive gland extracts administered. • Active components thought to be from prostate gland- termed Prostaglandins. What Next? • Isolation and characterisation of bioactive component in semen. • 20 carbon containing compounds- eicosanoids • Structural similarity to essential fatty acids- arachidonic acid PGE1 arachidonic acid What Next? • Enzymatic pathways to eicosanoid generation uncovered. • Many different prostaglandins and other bioactive products derived from arachidonic acid revealed. – Prostaglandins – Thromboxanes – Leukotrienes • Prostaglandins produced by most cells- broad regulatory activities • Eicosanoids not stored by cells- produced on demand (synthesised de novo) Prostanoids Phospholipids and Release of Arachidonic Acid by PLA2 Rang: Fig. 13.6 Alberts: Fig. 10-2 arachidonic acid Generation of Eicosanoids R cytokine inflammatory mediator other stimulus mechanical trauma Ca2+ phospholipase A2 (PLA2) liberation of arachidonic acid (AA) plasma membrane cellular membrane • Very low levels of free AA in resting cells • PLA2 liberation of AA- rate limiting step Phospholipids Arachidonic Acid PLA2 Leukotrienes Lipoxygenase LOX Prostanoids • Prostaglandins • Thromboxanes Cyclooxygenase COX PGI2 TXA2 Cyclooxygenase COX PGF2a PGD2 PGE2 PGG2 PGH2 Arachidonic Acid Most cells Cell specific synthase enzymes most cellsmast cellsuterus prostacyclin vascular endothelium platelets 5-Lipoxygenase LTB4LTC4 LTD4 LTE4 Arachidonic Acid Mainly inflammatory cells Cysteinyl- leukotrienes • First identified in activated leukocytes How do eicosanoids produce their effects? • Act via selective receptors- all G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) • Subsequent generation of second messenger molecules Fig. 11.6 Campbell and Reece, Biology 6th Edit, Benjamin Cummings, 2002 G-Protein Coupled Receptors PGs- Inflammation Stewart AG and Mackay GA.
