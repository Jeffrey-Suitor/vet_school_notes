L E C T U R E O V E R V I E W In this lecture, we will overview various diseases of the upper gastrointestinal tract focusing on the oesophagus. Pathology of tonsils and salivary glands are briefly reviewed. Some of the inflammatory lesions in the oesophagus are caused by extension of the inflammation from the oral cavity. Congenital and acquired megaoesophagus will be reviewed in detail in this seminar.
