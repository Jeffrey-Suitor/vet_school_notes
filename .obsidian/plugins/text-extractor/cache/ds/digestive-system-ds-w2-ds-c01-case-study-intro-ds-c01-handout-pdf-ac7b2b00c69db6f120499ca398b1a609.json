Respectful listening enhances a positive group dynamic, and creates a space where it is safe for all to contribute. • Taking time to discuss is really important - discussing involves questioning and responding, reviewing and reflecting, sharing understanding. This is where deep learning occurs. It can often be greatly enhanced by visualisation - by sharing of ideas, summaries and processes on your white board and by collective rephrasing and reframing of ideas. • Sharing of tasks and responsibilities is also important in group work. Perhaps make a roster and each week have a different group member take responsibility for the keyboard, and for completing your interactive pdf. 3 SCENARIO You are working as a veterinarian in a busy inner-suburban small animal practice. Mrs Brown has scheduled an appointment for her cat Snowy, a 12-year-old female Siamese. Mrs Brown is very concerned, as since this morning Snowy has been restless, crying out and falling off the furniture. 4 QUESTION 1 • In the box below, list the key information about Snowy. (Key information is all the information that may be relevant in assessing her current condition - including the signalment, present condition and anything relevant that her owner has told you.) • What further information might help you to better understand Snowy's presenting problem(s)? Make a list of these questions, explain your reasoning for asking these questions. 5 history You review Snowy's clinical records from previous visits to the clinic. 6 • Adapt your problem list from Question 1 to incorporate new information. Are there any new problems you would like to add? • List the possible causes for each identified problem. (At this stage these possible causes are just hypotheses - you will need more information in order to reach a definitive diagnosis). Where possible assign an organ system to each of these possible causes. • Are there any terms or abbreviations in the history you don't understand? • Draw a basic flow diagram that summarises the progression (history) of presenting signs for Snowy between his first presentation and most recent presentation at the clinic. 7 • Discuss amongst your group the possible organ system(s) that could link all of the presenting signs that you have listed. • For as many presenting signs as you can manage (e.g. weight loss or excessive drinking), explain step-by-step how disease of this organ system could lead to one of Snowy’s presenting signs. Whilst you may not be able to do this alone, the power of group work is that each one of you brings prior learning and experience to your discussion - you may be surprised how well you can build your shared understanding of the processes involved! (But please don’t be concerned if you get stuck…we are not expecting you to be content experts at this stage!) 8 FINAL ACTIVITY Each case study, you will construct a flow diagram to explain how the particular disease presentation can be explained in pathophysiological terms - in other words, how has a disease (pathological process) affected normal physiology, and how does that explain the clinical signs that are observed. Once you have explained each of the presenting signs individually, you are equipped to construct a flow diagram that links all of the presenting signs in a more complex picture of Snowy's disease. Combine the steps you have identified above to construct a final detailed flow diagram. Remember: Once you have finished, save a copy of this editable PDF to share with all group members. You can post this document to your Group page on Canvas for easy access.","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
