K E Y W O R D S Palatoschisis, brachygnathia, stomatitis, vesicle, papule, erosion, ulcer, glossitis, epulis. L E C T U R E O V E R V I E W In this lecture, we will overview various diseases of the upper gastrointestinal tract focusing on the oral cavity. The protective mechanisms of the oral cavity and basic reactions of the gastrointestinal tract to injury will be reviewed. Developmental anomalies affecting palate, lips, mandible/maxilla as well as inflammatory and neoplastic conditions of the oral cavity will be examined in detail. Oral inflammatory lesions are classified into vesicular, erosive and ulcerative, papular, idiopathic, and deep stomatitis. The etiology and pathogenesis of these conditions are reviewed in detail. The common proliferative conditions of the oral cavity including gingival hyperplasia, epulis, papillomatosis, squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma, and fibrosarcoma are examined in detail in this lecture.
