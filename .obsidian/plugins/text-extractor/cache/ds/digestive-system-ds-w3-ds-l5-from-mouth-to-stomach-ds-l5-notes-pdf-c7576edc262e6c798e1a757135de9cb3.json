SALIVARY GLANDS • secrete saliva to - moisten food (assists mastication) - lubricate bolus during deglutition • scattered salivary glands in lips, cheeks, soft palate and tongue • secretions mostly mucous (carbohydrate-rich) • majority of saliva from distinct large salivary glands: • secretions mostly serous (watery and protein-rich) Parotid gland: • located superficially, ventral to ear • larger in herbivores than in carnivores • duct travels: • across lateral surface of masseter muscle in dog ⇒ opening in vestibule adjacent to upper fourth premolar tooth • medial to ventral border of mandible in horse and ox ⇒ crosses ventral border of mandible laterally ⇒ enters vestibule as for dog Mandibular gland: • located at angle of jaw • deeper and larger in herbivores • duct opens at sublingual caruncle (close to frenulum) Sublingual gland: • monostomatic (single duct) and polystomatic (multiple ducts) parts in most species • ducts run along floor of oral cavity and open adjacent to frenulum Zygomatic gland: • present in dog and cat • medial to zygomatic arch (in orbit) • duct opens opposite last upper molar Veterinary Bioscience 1: Digestive system 2 • Distribution of salivary glands (Dyce et al, 1987, Fig. 3-13, p. 103) 3 Microscopic structure of salivary glands: • branching duct system: acinus ⇒ intercalated duct ⇒ striated duct ⇒ interlobular duct ⇒ primary duct • secretory cells arranged in acini (clusters of cells arranged around a lumen) surrounded by basement membrane • contain serous or mucous acini, or both Structure of a mixed salivary gland (Jamieson, 1983, Fig. 21-16, p. 766) Acini Serous • cells pyramidal • round basal nuclei • basophilic perinuclear cytoplasm • secretory granules in apical cytoplasm Mucous • cells swollen with mucous secretions • flattened basal nucleus Mixed glands • individual acini composed entirely of serous or mucous cells, or both: • serous demilunes in mixed acini Parotid gland: purely serous in most species (not dog) Mandibular and sublingual glands: mixed mucous and serous 4 Ducts Intercalated duct: low cuboidal epithelium Striated duct: columnar epithelium with basal striations (alignment of mitochondria) Interlobular duct: simple columnar ⇒ stratified columnar Innervation: • secretion under autonomic (parasympathetic) control: • cranial nerve VII (facial) ⇒ mandibular, sublingual, buccal and zygomatic glands • cranial nerve IX (glossopharyngeal) ⇒ parotid gland PHARYNX • region common to digestive and respiratory tracts • demarcated from oral cavity by palatoglossal arch • lined by mucosa with mucous glands, and collagen and elastic fibres in lamina propria • wall formed by three groups of muscles: o constrictors o dilator o shortener • lymphoid tissue (defence against infection) - both scattered and in tonsils • tonsils may have smooth surface (e.g. palatine tonsil, dog) or crypts (e.g. palatine tonsil, horse) • partially subdivided by soft palate into nasopharynx (dorsal to soft palate) and oropharynx (ventral to soft palate) • HORSE: epiglottis overlaps with an elongated soft palate, holding it in the nasopharynx (except during swallowing. Therefore horses are obligate nasal breathers, and a stomach tube must be placed via the nose. Innervation: Motor and sensory: - contributions from cranial nerves IX and X (vagus). 5 DEGLUTITION • initiated voluntarily, but taken over by reflexes once food reaches pharynx Bolus of food prepared by mastication and insalivation ⇓ apex of tongue pressed against palate ⇓ rapid contraction of mylohyoideus and extrinsic muscles of tongue to propel food into pharynx ⇓ contact with pharyngeal mucosa sets off reflexes ⇓ soft palate raised, glottis (narrowest part of larynx) closed, hyoid apparatus drawn rostrally, pharynx shortened (by pharyngeal shorteners) ⇓ bolus moved into oesophagus by pharyngeal constrictors ⇓ wave of peristalsis conveys bolus to stomach 6 OESOPHAGUS • also known as the gullet Function • to conduct food from the mouth to the stomach Structure • simple muscular tube that runs from the pharynx to the stomach in 3 segments: • cervical, thoracic and abdominal Cervical segment: • from pharynx to thoracic inlet (surrounded by 1st ribs, 1st sternebra and 1st thoracic vertebra) • begins dorsal to cricoid cartilage of larynx (immediately rostral to beginning of trachea) • follows trachea down neck, initially inclining to left o medial to left jugular groove o returns to median position above trachea at about level of 1st rib Thoracic segment: • runs within mediastinum in thorax (mediastinum formed from membranes that separate thorax into two pleural cavities and surround unpaired structures such as heart and oesophagus) • passes over base of heart • crosses right side of aortic arch (beginning of aorta as it leaves heart) • runs dorsal to bifurcation of trachea (branching of trachea into two bronchi) • diverges slightly to left as it runs caudally in mediastinum ventral to aorta • penetrates oesophageal hiatus of diaphragm (muscular structure separating thorax from abdomen) Abdominal segment: • very short, especially in ruminant • passes over dorsal border of liver (indenting it) to join the stomach dorsally at the cardia 7 Structure of wall of oesophagus • conforms to common pattern of alimentary canal, with four main layers: • Mucosa • Submucosa • Muscularis externa • Adventitia or Serosa Mucosa: • innermost layer, facing lumen • thrown into prominent longitudinal folds, thus great dilation of tube possible • composed of 2-3 layers- Epithelium -stratified squamous keratinised or non-keratinised, depending on species (depends on consistency of ingested food - usually keratinised in horse, ruminant and pig but not in carnivore) Lamina propria - rich in collagen and elastic fibres; leucocytes; ducts of submucosal glands Muscularis mucosae -thin layer of smooth muscle in mucosa at caudal end of oesophagus - usually absent at cranial end (subject to species variation) - provides localised movement of mucosa Submucosa: • Loose connective tissue, mainly collagen and some elastic fibres o rich in glands - produce mucus for lubrication • contains glands at cranial end in most species (but along full length of oesophagus in dog) Muscularis externa: • muscle layer which moves food into stomach by contraction • cranial and caudal oesophageal sphincters suggested based on functional studies rather than morphological evidence; capable of maintaining intra-oesophageal intraluminal pressure higher than intra-gastric pressure. (The caudal \"sphincter\" in the horse has sufficient tone that it usually remains closed during gastric dilation to the point of gastric rupture without vomiting occurring.) • Usually thickest layer of wall • Two layers of muscle - difficult to define at cranial end, but at caudal end obvious inner circular and outer longitudinal layers • dog and ruminant- composed of skeletal muscle throughout; other species- usually skeletal at cranial end - becomes smooth at caudal third Adventitia/serosa: • outermost layer • Adventitia - where connective tissue merges with that of surrounding structures, e.g. in the neck, within the mediastinum. • Serosa - where oesophagus lies within the abdomen (very short); connective tissues covered by epithelial layer 8 Blood supply • branches of common carotid, bronchoesophageal and left gastric arteries, depending on region Nerve supply • branches of sympathetic and vagus nerves Sites of possible obstruction • Cranial and caudal oesophagus • Entrance to thoracic cavity - thoracic inlet • Over base of heart • Immediately anterior to diaphragmatic hiatus Comparative anatomy Birds: o on right side of neck in cervical region. o crop - a saccular diverticulum of oesophagus cranial to thoracic inlet.
