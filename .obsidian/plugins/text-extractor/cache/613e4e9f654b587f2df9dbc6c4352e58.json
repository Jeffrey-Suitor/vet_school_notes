M AT E RI AL P R O V IDE D Each group of students will have one sheep and/or pig heart. In addition, demonstration specimens will be available including the bovine and equine heart. All fresh specimens are dependent on availability that week, so the species may vary. Since these specimens were obtained from the abattoir, the major vessels entering and leaving the heart might have been cut too short and the pericardium might be damaged or not present. However, on the whole they should suffice for this exercise. OV E RV I E W Before comparing the heart of the different species, you should firstly be acquainted with the pericardium and the external and internal features of the heart. Take any heart provided on your table for this purpose. This prac therefore has two parts: Part1 Dissection of either a pig or sheep heart, to identify the structures of the heart and pericardium that are listed below. An excerpt from the sections on the heart and pericardium in Miller’s Guide to the Dissection of the Dog are also provided in this manual to assist you with finding these structures. Part 2: Examining the demonstration specimens provided to determine the differences between species with respect to the anatomy of the heart. A table of information is also provided to assist you in determining the species from which the different hearts originate. P ART 1 : D I S S E C T I O N OF T H E H E ART P ER IC AR D IU M The pericardium is the fibro-serous covering of the heart. Identify the base and the apex of the heart and visualise how the heart is anchored in position in the thoracic cavity in life. What is the ligament which attaches the apex of the sac to the sternum and mediastinal pleura? Make an incision from the base to the apex of the pericardium. Note that the pericardium and the epicardium are continuous at the base of the heart. Between these two layers is the pericardial cavity, which contains a small amount of fluid – pericardial fluid. What is the colour and nature of this fluid? Recall the function of this fluid. You may now reflect the pericardium and sever it carefully from the heart. EXT ER N A L F EAT U R ES O F T H E H EAR T Note the size and shape of the heart, and the colour and texture of the fat on the heart. Refer to the table of information and determine from which species this heart was obtained. Identify the following (you may use Miller’s Guide 4th Ed, pp 143-149): • Base • Apex • Atrial surface • Auricular surface • Coronary groove • Interventricular grooves o subsinuosal interventricular groove o paraconal interventricular groove • Right and left atrium and the auricles • Right and left ventricles • Major vessels entering and leaving the heart: o cranial vena cava o caudal vena cava o pulmonary trunk o aorta • Major vessels supplying the heart wall: o right coronary artery o left coronary artery o circumflex and interventricular branches o coronary sinus and great cardiac vein I N TE RN A L F E A TU RE S O F T H E H E A RT: TH E F O U R CH A M B E RS Dissect in the manner as described in Miller’s Guide 4th Edn pp 144-148: RI G H T A TRI U M Identify and examine the following: • Opening of the caudal vena cava, coronary sinus, cranial vena cava • Right atrioventricular orifice • Interatrial septum • Fossa ovalis (what was it in the foetus?) • Right auricle • Pectinate muscles • Endocardium RI G H T VE N TRI CLE Identify and examine the following: • Pulmonary valve • Right atrioventricular valve • Chordae tendineae (function?) • Papillary muscles • Trabeculae carneae (what similar structures are found in the atrium and what could be their function?) • Conus arteriosus RI G H T A TRI U M Identify and examine the following: • Note the openings of the pulmonary veins • Left auricle • Pectinate muscles • Valve of foramen ovale RI G H T VE N TRI CLE Compare the thickness of the wall with that of the right ventricle. Identify and examine the following: • Left atrioventricular valve • Chordae tendineae (compare with right ventricle) • Papillary muscles (compare with right ventricle) • Aortic valve • Aortic sinus • Opening of right and left coronary arteries P ART 2 : C OM P ARI NG H E ART S F ROM D I F F E RE NT S P E C I E S : Since you are now familiar with the various components of the heart, with the help of the table provided: • Identify from which species the other hearts were obtained • Compare the distinctive characteristic features of the other hearts.
