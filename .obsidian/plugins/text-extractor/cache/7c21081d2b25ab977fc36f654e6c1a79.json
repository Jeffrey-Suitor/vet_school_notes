Observation at rest • Respiratory rate and effort • Can be difficult in consultation setting • Train owners to monitor at home • Increased rate can indicate congestive heart failure • Dogs and cats: normal sleeping rate <30 breaths/min • Horses: normal resting rate 8 – 16 breaths/min Mucous membranes • Mucous membrane colour • Normal: ‘healthy pink’ • Capillary refill time • Normal: <2 sec Mucous membranesCyanosis • Blueish tinge to mucous membranes or skin • Generally indicates respiratory compromise • Cardiac causes: • Pulmonary oedema, pleural effusion • Right to left PDA • Differential cyanosis • Pulmonic stenosis or pulmonary hypertension with ASD or VSD (i.e. Tetralogy of Fallot) • Generalised cyanosis Systemic veins • Jugular vein most commonly assessed • Distension • Hepatojugular reflux • Increased filling pressures (often right sided CHF) • Thrombosis or extramural pressure • Pulsation • Tricuspid valve insufficiency • Cardiac tamponade • Pulmonary hypertension • Other signs of ↑ right sided pressures? Precordial palpation • ‘Precordial thump’ • Feel the heart hitting the body wall • ‘Precordial thrill’ • Vibration associated with turbulent blood flow • Auscultation will reveal a murmur Arterial pulses • Palpation simultaneous with auscultation • Pulse pressure = systolic pressure – diastolic pressure • Bounding pulse • Quick decay diastolic pressure • PDA • Aortic valve insufficiency • Weak pulse • Ejection impedance • Myocardial failure • Cardiac tamponade • Shock (cardiovascular collapse) • Aortic stenosis • Pulse deficit? Cardiac auscultation • Patient preparation important • Quiet • Still, standing • Not panting or purring • Forelimb held/placed forward • Thorough auscultation over entire precordium Heart sounds Sound Aetiology S1 “lub dub” Closure of the AV valves S2 “lub dub” Closure of the semilunar valves S3 “lub dub-da” Rapid early ventricular filling S4 “ba-lub dub” Atrial contraction Cardiac auscultationHeart murmurs • Abnormal sounds – turbulent blood flow • Described by: • Timing • Intensity • Point of maximal intensity • Radiation • Quality/character Heart murmurs: Timing • Systolic murmur • Holosystolic • Pansystolic • Examples? • Diastolic murmur • Examples? • Continuous murmur • Example? • To and fro murmur • Two separate problems Heart murmurs: Intensity Grading system: I-VI Grade not proportional to severity of disease • Size and velocity of turbulent jet • e.g. smaller ventricular septal defect louder murmur • Contact with heart wall • e.g. mitral regurgitation directed to middle of atrium vs. atrial wall Point of maximal intensity (PMI)Heart murmurs: Quality/character • Frequency/shape of sound • Ejection (crescendo-decrescendo) • Plateau (even) • Blowing (decrescendo) • Musical (high pitched vibration) Heart murmurs • Species variations • S3 and S4 • Pathologic in dogs and cats (‘gallop’) • Can be heard in normal horses • Systolic ‘click’ • Early pathology in dogs and cats • Can be heard in normal horses • Split S1 and S2 • Closure of valves on left and right sides slightly offset • Occasionally heard in horses (slow heart rate) • ‘Physiological’ or ‘functional’ murmur • Normal turbulent high velocity blood flow through large diameter vessels of young fit horses Cardiac auscultation • Audibility • Increased • Hyperdynamic heart • Cardiac enlargement • Decreased • Pericardial effusion • Pleural effusion • Thoracic mass • Myocardial failure Heart rhythm • Normal – regular rhythm • ‘Regularly regular’ • Arrhythmia/dysrhythmia – irregular rhythm • ‘Regularly irregular’ • ‘Irregularly irregular’ Pulmonary auscultation • Normal sounds: • Bronchovesicular sounds – soft, breezy, low-pitched • Abnormal sounds: • Crackles – Usually end-inspiratory, fine or coarse. May indicate small airways opening with alveolar oedema or pulmonary fibrosis. • Wheezes – Associated with airway obstruction, e.g. feline asthma or bronchial disease. • Rhonchi – Coarse rattling sounds. Summary • Lecture concepts reinforced in practical classes • Refer to intended learning outcomes • Practice your clinical examinations at every opportunity! • Learn normal • Recognise abnormal","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
