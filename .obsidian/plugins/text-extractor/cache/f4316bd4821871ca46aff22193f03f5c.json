Coronary 2. Pulmonary 3. Cutaneous 4. Cerebral circulation 1. Coronary circulation • Supplies oxygen to the heart – critically important! • Must deliver oxygen at a high rate to meet myocardial demand (dramatic  during exercise) • Left & right coronary arteries – Each has circumflex and interventricular branches 5 • The coronary arteries are the first branches of the aorta 1. Coronary circulation  Left coronary artery opens from L aortic sinus  Right coronary artery opens from R aortic sinus 6 1. Coronary circulation Left coronary artery • Opens from left aortic sinus • Passes laterally beneath left auricle • Divides into: – Left (or paraconal) interventricular artery • Lies in the left I-V groove – Left circumflex artery • Lies in the circular coronary groove 1. Coronary circulation Right coronary artery • Opens from right aortic sinus • Passes laterally beneath right auricle • Divides into – Right (or subsinuosal) I-V artery • Lies in the right I-V groove, and – Right circumflex artery • Lies in the circular coronary groove 8 1. Coronary circulation • Key difference: origin of the right interventricular artery Dog, Ruminants: R. interventricular artery arises from L. coronary artery! • Left coronary artery supplies:  All I-V septum  All L. ventricle  Regions of R. ventricle adjoining the L. and R. interventricular groove • Right coronary artery supplies:  Remainder of R. ventricle ∴ L. coronary a. carries 80% of coronary arterial flow Species variation Right coronary artery Left coronary artery Paraconal IV branch Circumflex branch Subsinuosal IV branch It’s not doing much! 10 1. Coronary circulation Species variation R. interventricular a. from RIGHT coronary artery • Left coronary a. supplies:  Most of the I-V septum  Most of the L. ventricle  Little of the R. ventricle • Right coronary artery supplies:  Part of I-V septum  Regions of L. ventricle adjoining the R. interventricular groove  Most of R. ventricle ∴ Both coronary arteries similar in size Horse, Pig Left coronary artery Paraconal IV branch Circumflex branch Right coronary artery Subsinuosal IV branch Microcirculation of the heart Most vascular part of the myocardium - • Subendocardial plexus  extensive network of arterioles and capillaries 1. Coronary circulationMyocardial capillary density is very high • Reduced diffusion distance: facilitates rapid O2 transport • Coronary blood flow/gram tissue: 10 times the whole-body average • Venous drainage of heart via: o Great cardiac vein and coronary sinus o Great cardiac v.: ascends L. (paraconal) IV groove  around L. coronary groove  coronary sinus on R. side Equine heart 1. Coronary circulation Coronary sinus: o Opens into R. atrium o Carries ~ 75% of total coronary flow Small coronary veins o Numerous, small, open directly into all four chambers of the heart Control of coronary blood flow • Increased oxygen required at  cardiac work rates supplied by  coronary blood flow Metabolic (active) hyperaemia: Coupling of blood flow to demand for oxygen Control of coronary blood flow Metabolic (active) hyperaemia: • Myocardium releases metabolic by-products in proportion to work rate (e.g. adenosine) • Act as local vasodilators  increased coronary blood flow • Sympathetic NS stimulation causes coronary vasodilation indirectly by increasing cardiac work rate ( heart rate and  contractility) Systole obstructs coronary blood flow Control of coronary blood flow • 2/3 of coronary arteries are intramural • Intramural vessels compressed during systole • Especially during isovolumetric contraction phase • 80% of coronary blood flow occurs during diastole • ß-blocker used to treat heart disease (esp cats) • Slows heart rate  reduces cardiac oxygen demand; and • Lengthens the interval of good perfusion of coronary arteries 19 2. Pulmonary circulation • Pulmonary circulation receives the output of the right ventricle • Supplies the alveolar capillaries involved in gas exchange • Control mechanisms exist to perfuse each alveolus in proportion to gas supply blood flow matches local gas supply Blood flow will distribute preferentially to well-oxygenated regions of the lungs 20 Pulmonary Arteries Pulmonary Trunk  Arises from conus arteriosus of R. ventricle  Bends caudally over base of the heart  Divides caudal to the aortic arch  Gives rise to L. and R. pulmonary arteries 2. Pulmonary circulation 21 Pulmonary Veins  Only veins to carry oxygenated blood  Conduct blood to left atrium  Have no valves  The pattern of distribution usually corresponds to the number of pulmonary lobes 2. Pulmonary circulation Pulmonary circulation differs from systemic circulation • Pressures are low due to low pulmonary vascular resistance  vessels more compliant  arteries & arterioles shorter and thinner walled • Basal tone is low • Sympathetic vasomotor nerves play no major role • Metabolic vasodilatation has no role; alveolar perfusion vastly exceeds metabolic demand 2. Pulmonary circulation Alveolar hypoxia is a potent constrictor of small pulmonary arteries:  Blood flow to poorly ventilated alveoli  Blood flow to better ventilated areas of lung This optimises local ventilation:perfusion ratios Note: in the systemic circulation, local hypoxia causes vasodilation 2. Pulmonary circulation 24 3. Cutaneous blood flow • Cutaneous blood flow plays an important role in thermoregulation  regulates core temperature • Heat is lost by radiation, conduction, convection and evaporation of sweat • Dermis well vascularised, epidermis is avascular 25 3. Cutaneous blood flow Supplied by: • Superficial • Middle and • Deep vascular plexuses 26 • Superficial and deep vascular beds  counter-current heat exchange mechanisms • Warm conditions: blood perfuses superficial capillary beds  heat loss via superficial veins • Cold conditions: peripheral vasoconstriction  • flow to deep capillaries and deep veins : countercurrent heat exchange between arteries and veins conserves heat 3. Cutaneous blood flow 27 • Arteriovenous anastomosis: present in the skin of the extremities • Direct connections between dermal arterioles and venules • Coiled, muscular-walled vessels • Controlled by sympathetic vasoconstrictor fibres • Dilate in warm conditions, constrict in cold conditions 3. Cutaneous blood flow 28 • Superficial and deep vascular beds  countercurrent heat exchange mechanisms ArterioleVein Venous plexus Capillary loop Sympathetic vasoconstrictor fibres Heat ↑ skin temperature ↑ heat loss ARTERIOVENOUS ANATSTOMOSIS 3. Cutaneous blood flow 30 4. Cerebral blood flow • Brain accounts for nearly 20% of resting oxygen consumption • Due to high oxygen demand  exquisitely sensitive to hypoxia  Consciousness lost after a few seconds of ischaemia • Primary role of cerebral circulation is to maintain oxygen delivery to the brain at all costs! 31 4. Cerebral blood flow Arterial supply to the head: • Two main vessels: 1. Common carotid arteries (L&R) 2. Vertebral arteries (L&R) 32 4. Cerebral blood flow • Extend up the neck along the trachea Branch at the atlanto- occipital joint into:  Internal carotid a.  intracranial circulation  External carotid a.  extracranial circulation Common carotid arteries (L&R) 33 4. Cerebral blood flow Vertebral arteries (L&R) • First branch of subclavian a. • Extends cranially through the transverse foramen of the anterior 6 cervical vertebrae • Fuses with occipital a. → cerebrospinal a. 34 4. Cerebral blood flow Cerebrospinal arteries (L&R) • L&R branches fuse to form the basilar artery Circle of Willis • Basilar artery anatomoses with internal carotid artery, forming the Circle of Willis • Circle of Willis supplies the brain with oxygenated blood 35 4. Cerebral blood flow Circle of Willis: functional significance • Artery to artery anastomosis: provides for collateral circulation • Preserves cerebral perfusion if carotid artery or vertebral artery (or their branches) are obstructed → safeguards arterial supply to brain • Brain microcirculation consists of functional end arteries  blockage causes local ischaemia 36 4. Cerebral blood flow Cerebral capillaries form a tight blood-brain barrier • BBB functions to:  protect the cerebral neurons from interference from circulating solutes and pathogens  maintain a tightly controlled pH  prevent washout of neurotransmitters • Lipid-soluble molecules (oxygen, carbon dioxide, general anaesthetic drugs) diffuse freely across capillaries • Created by specialised endothelial cell junctions Blood – brain barrier • Endothelial cells have closed intercellular (tight) junctions • Thick basement membrane • Surrounded by ‘end feet’ from astrocytes 4. Cerebral blood flow Major veins :  External jugular v.  Internal jugular v.  Vertebral v. Venous drainage of the head All drain → Cranial vena cava → R. atrium • Begins near angle of the jaw with union of: – Maxillary v. – drains deeper and caudal structures of head – Linguofacial v. – drains superficial and rostral structures • Superficial – passes down neck in jugular groove • Commonly used for venepuncture Venous drainage of the head External jugular vein Jugular VenepunctureSummary 1.
