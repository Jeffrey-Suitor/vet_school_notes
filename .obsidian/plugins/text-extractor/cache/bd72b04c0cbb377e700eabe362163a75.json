In parts of the oral cavity the epithelium is ‘keratinised’ (cornified)* – extent depends on species. (Cornified cells have lost their nucleus and are filled with a keratin protein matrix that, among other roles, provides increased resistance to mechanical forces *All epithelial cells contain keratin, so ‘cornified’ is probably more accurate.) Lamina propria – a layer of connective tissue (Lamina muscularis – 3rd layer seen in other mucosae, but not oral mucosa – this absence results in an indistinct margin between lamina propria and submucosa) Submucosa: is a further layer of connective tissue that in certain regions of the oral cavity (lips, tongue, palate, cheeks) contains minor salivary glands 2 Muscular tunic: where present (lips, cheeks, soft palate) comprises skeletal muscle. (is mostly smooth muscle elsewhere in the digestive tract) LIPS Layers: • mucosa: epithelium keratinized in horses and ruminants, not in carnivores or pigs • submucosa: contains minor salivary glands (labial glands) with ducts opening through oral mucosa • muscle (see below), tendon • skin Major muscles • orbicularis oris – encircles opening of oral cavity within lips and acts to close lips • other muscles (variation between species) • levator nasolabialis – dilate nostril and lift upper lip • levator labii superioris – lift upper lip +/- dilate nostril • caninus lift upper lip (eg snarling - dog) +/- dilate nostril • depressor labii inferioris (not dog, cat) – depresses lower lip • all innervated by cranial nerve VII (= Facial N.) 1.Orbicularis oris 2. Caninus 4. Depressor labii inferioris 6. Levator nasolabialis 7. Levator labii superioris Dyce 1996 Diagram of section through lip 3 • species variations: • loose with thin, serrated margin in dog • sensitive and mobile in horse • ox: insensitive and thick, lined with buccal papillae • philtrum (dogs, cats, camelids, sheep): cleft marking division of upper lip (feature allows closer grazing by sheep compared with cattle) • extent in relation to dental arcade varies with diet type - affects size of ‘gape’ -one result is different methods of drinking - e.g. herbivores vs. carnivores CHEEKS • form the walls of the oral cavity caudal to lips and together with the lips form the vestibule • layers as for lips • Mucosal epithelium may be keratinized, depending on the particular area and the species • in ruminants and camelids buccal mucosa has caudally directed conical buccal papillae • Buccal glands = minor salivary glands in submucosa • Muscular tunic formed by the buccinator muscle - functions to return food from vestibule to oral cavity proper (Facial N/CN VII) 4 PALATE • Forms roof of oral cavity – separates oral cavity from nasal cavity • comprised of hard palate rostrally and soft palate caudally Hard palate • bone covered by thick mucosa which forms ridges (rugae) – help guide food caudally • Mucosal epithelium keratinized, submucosa dense and closely attached to periosteum • Ruminants have a dental pad = rostral portion of hard palate, with heavily keratinized mucosa overlying a thick layer of dense connective tissue • Palatine glands (minor salivary) are present in all domestic species except pigs • bone= incisive, maxilla and palatine bones Soft palate • Comprises a dorsal and a ventral mucosal layer separated by connective tissue, minor salivary glands (palatine) and 3 paired muscles which shorten, tense and raise the palate TONGUE • root - attached to hyoid apparatus (fine bony structure suspended from skull) • body - attached to mandible • apex – free rostral portion • connected to the floor of oral cavity by the frenulum 5 • The mucosal epithelium on the dorsum of the tongue is thick and keratinised and bears numerous lingual papillae. Mucosal epithelium on the ventral aspect is non- keratinised. • The mucosa has abundant capillaries and arteriovenous anastomoses, and these participate in thermoregulation (eg heat loss – panting) • Minor salivary glands are in the submucosa (lingual glands). Serous gustatory glands open into the sulcus of the vallate papillae Papillae – mechanical or gustatory • variations between species regarding those present and relative abundance • Filiform: mechanical function, cover most of tongue surface, short, point caudally, keratinised, assist with gripping of food. Modified in cats: hollow spines (‘cavopapillae’) that wick fluids, allow deposition of saliva deep into fur (thermoregulation, grooming) • Conical: mechanical function-larger than filiform papillae ⇒present on root of tongue in dogs cats and pigs, on torus linguae in ruminants (also inside cheeks and lips) • Lentiform/Lenticular: mechanical function, round to ovoid, present on torus linguae of ox • Fungiform: somewhat mushroom shaped, scattered among the filiform papillae, are gustatory papillae (taste function) - number of taste buds carried varies between species • Foliate: ‘leaf like’ – parallel folds on lateral margin of tongue rostral to the palatoglossal arch – also gustatory. Absent in ruminants, lack taste buds in cats. • Vallate/circumvallate: Large, flattened and surrounded by a circular sulcus, demarcate junction between body and root of tongue – gustatory. Number varies between species. • NB marginal papillae found on margin of rostral tongue in newborn dog and pig – mechanical: aid suckling, disappear with change from liquid to solid food Taste buds: clusters of specialised cells embedded in the epithelium of gustatory papillae – have a small opening, the taste pore at the epithelial surface and their base is in contact with fibres of nerves that convey sense of taste to brain from tongue (Facial N/ VII and Glossopharyngeal N/ IX). NB. Taste buds are also present in soft palate, epiglottis and other areas of oral cavity and pharynx Dyce et al, 1996, p105 6 • species differences: • torus of ruminant tongue - enlarged body with lingual fossa rostral to it. • Carnivores have a lyssa: responsible for median groove/sulcus in tongue, rod shaped fibrous body in median plane beneath ventral mucosa = sheath of connective tissue enclosing muscle, adipose tissue and a small amount of cartilage • horse tongue has median dorsal lingual cartilage under dorsal mucosa Muscles • The tongue is supported by mylohyoideus m. – the most ventral muscle between the paired mandibles and just dorsal to the mylohyoideus, the geniohyoideus m. – extends from the chin to the hyoid apparatus. These muscles do not insert directly onto the tongue so act on it indirectly • Is highly muscular ⇒ very mobile (prehension, lapping, grooming, manipulation of food) • Intrinsic muscles (located entirely within tongue):- longitudinal, transverse and vertical bundles, protrude tongue, complex local movements • Extrinsic muscles: are muscles which originate on the hyoid apparatus (styloglossus, hyoglossus) or mandible (genioglossus) and insert in the tongue - act to depress, protrude or retract the tongue (Evans and Christensen p 438) Summary of Tongue Innervation: • Motor: • all (intrinsic and extrinsic) muscles innervated by cranial nerve XII (hypoglossal) • Sensory: • General/somatic sensation: • rostral two-thirds – cranial nerve V (trigeminal-mandibular division) • caudal third – cranial nerve IX (glossopharyngeal) • taste: • rostral two-thirds – cranial nerve VII (facial) • caudal third – cranial nerve IX (glossopharyngeal) 7 MUSCLES OF MASTICATION Mandibular muscles in the dog – Lateral aspect, zygomatic arch removed (Konig and Liebich, Fig.2.4, p122) Jaw-closing muscles: All innervated by mandibular branch of trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V) Temporalis • Origin on extensive area of lateral surface of cranium (frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital bones) and insertion on coronoid process of mandible • contraction pulls mandible upward • large in carnivores; relatively small in herbivores Masseter • origin - maxillary region of skull and zygomatic arch • insertion - wide area of caudal mandible • main actions • to raise mandible (close jaws) • move lower jaw laterally when contracted on one side (origin lateral to insertion); greater sideways movement in herbivores than in carnivores • protrude lower jaw 8 Pterygoids (lateral and medial pterygoid mm.) • medial to mandible • origin - pterygopalatine region of skull • insertion - medial face of mandible • actions • close jaws • move lower jaw medially when contracted on one side (origin medial to insertion) • protrude lower jaw Jaw-opening muscle Digastricus (‘2-bellied’) • Innervated by both mandibular branch of trigeminal (rostral belly) and facial (cranial nerve VII; caudal belly) • origin on occipital bone (jugular process) of skull, caudal to temporomandibular joint • insertion on mandible (ventral aspect) 9 Temporomandibular Joint: Evans,1993,p223 • articulation between zygomatic process of temporal bone of skull and condyloid process of mandible • In all domestic species is divided into a dorsal and ventral compartment by an intra articular disc – arrangement thought to allow complex movements to occur at the joint • Flat articular surfaces in herbivores allow lateral to medial excursions of mandible for grinding of food between cheek teeth – action relies on coordination between pterygoids and masseters on each side, these muscles therefore relatively larger in herbivores • Bony processes around the joint restrict movement to hinge like action in carnivores – in these animals the emphasis is usually on vertical force to grasp and kill prey. Temporal muscle is typically the most important in these species (Popowicz and Herring, p 67) 10 PHARYNX • The caudal boundary of the oral cavity is demarcated by the palatoglossal arches that extend from the soft palate to the body of the tongue • Is the passage that is, in part, common to the respiratory and digestive system • Has three parts: • Oropharynx: ventral to soft palate - extends from palatoglossal arches to base of epiglottis and caudal margin of soft palate • Nasopharynx: dorsal to hard and soft palate - extends from choanae (internal nostrils) to intrapharyngeal ostium (formed by the palatopharyngeal arches and the caudal (free) boundary of soft palate). Is part of the air passages and food does not enter it. • Laryngopharynx: Dorsal to larynx and extends from intrapharyngeal ostium to opening of oesophagus. Wider rostrally, narrows towards entrance to oesophagus. Its floor is largely occupied by the entrance to the larynx. The epiglottis (most rostral laryngeal cartilage) acts to divert fluids into the piriform recesses that run along either side of the larynx (Evans and Christensen, p452, 1979) Pharyngeal Muscles: Skeletal muscles with function related to fibre orientation: 1. Dilator: transversely oriented fibres in the rostral pharynx – act to widen the rostral pharynx to allow it to accept the food bolus 2. Constrictors: the rostral, middle and caudal constrictors = the major constrictors. These originate from either side of the pharynx and meet in the dorsal midline to form arches of muscle. They contract in succession to move the bolus of food towards the oesophagus 3. Shorteners. These are longitudinally (rostro-caudal) oriented muscles that act to shorten the pharynx and thus draw it forward over the bolus of food. There are species differences regarding the specific muscles present for each action. Innervation of the pharynx: Sensory and motor innervation is provided by both Glossopharyngeal (CN IX) and Vagus (CN X) Nerves. 11 References: Eurell J and Frappier BL (eds): Dellmann’s Textbook of Veterinary Histology, 6th ed., 2006 Hermanson JW, de Lahunta A and Evans HE, Miller and Evans Anatomy of the Dog 5th Ed. 2020 - also previous editions of Millers Anatomy of the Dog Evans HE, de Lahunta, A: Miller’s Guide to the Dissection of the Dog.
