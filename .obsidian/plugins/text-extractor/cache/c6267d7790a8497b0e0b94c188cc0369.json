Understand the causes and potential consequences of systemic hypertension and explain why systemic hypertension tends to be a self-perpetuating phenomenon LO 3 6 Systemic Hypertension Sustained increase in arterial BP Ettinger, 2017 Systemic Hypertension 7 • Arterial baraoreflex is crucial in beat-to- beat control of the circulation: both heart rate and blood pressure • Every time the heart beats, BP rises (artery stretch). • There are arterial and cardiopulmonary baroreceptors, activation of which will cause inhibition of sympathetic output. • The body is constantly measuring and readjusting heart rate • Blood volume is also constantly being measured https://derangedphysiology.com/main/cicm-primary-exam/required-reading/cardiovascular- system/Chapter%207.6.0/normal-arterial-line-waveforms Systemic Hypertension 8 • Regulation of arteriolar diameter is regulated both intrinsically and extrinsically Normal Dilate Constrict Intrinsic Regulation e.g. • Pressure myogenic response • Endothelially derived factors • E.g. Nitric Oxide • Paracrine factors -e.g. histamine • Local metabolites • Temperature Extrinsic Regulation • Vasomotor nerves esp. sympathetic vasoconstrictors • Vasoactive hormones: e.g. Angiotensin II, ADH (vasopressin), Adrenalin. Aldosterone Systemic Hypertension 9 Doppler blood pressure measurement in a dog 10 • Non-invasive measurement of BP • Doppler machine • Blood pressure cuff measured to the size of the patient • Sphygmomanometer • Willow, our canine volunteer ☺ • SH can be divided into two categories – Secondary hypertension → more common – Primary, or idiopathic, hypertension • More common in older male dogs than females • Doppler (better for cats) or oscillometric techniques for measurement. • Be aware of the white coat effect – Take many readings – Quiet room »Cats > 160mmHg »Dogs > 150mmHg https://vetgirlontherun.com/veterinary-continuing-educationdoppler- blood-pressure-vetgirl-video/ http://seattleclouds.com/myapplications/MattWalker/VetExam/CatBlood.html Systemic Hypertension in dogs and cats 11 Conditions commonly associated with systemic hypertension: • Kidney Disease – The most common • Hyperadrenocorticism • Adrenal Tumours • Hyperthyroidism • Diabetes Mellitus • Cardiovascular Disease • Obesity • Drugs http://doctoritapisicilor.blogspot.com/2015/02/importanta-unei-examinari-clinice.html Secondary Hypertension 12 • Target-organ Damage (TOD) 1. Ocular Manifestations • Choroidopathy/Retinopathy → Altered vessel diameter --> partial or complete retinal detachment, haemorrhage, multifocal oedema • Common in geriatric feline patients Ettinger, 2017 Clinical Manifestations 13 • Target-organ Damage (TOD) 2. Cardiac Manifestations • Left ventricular hypertrophy most common – Normalise wall stress and preserve left ventricular chamber function Clinical Manifestations 14 • Target-organ Damage (TOD) 3. Renal Manifestations • Hypertensive nephrosclerosis • Cause and effect? 4. Neurological Manifestations • Hypertensive encephalopathy 5. Epistaxis Clinical Manifestations 15 • Once identified it should be treated • Treatment of primary disease • Goal – amelioration of clinical signs if present Ettinger, 2017 Treatment 16 Systemic Hypertension Systemic Hypotension 17 SAP = cardiac output x total peripheral vascular resistance = (heart rate x stroke volume) x total peripheral vascular resistance • Systemic hypotension can therefore result from any condition that promotes a persistent decrease in the CO and/or PVR • Sustained hypotension can result in shock »SAP < 80 mmHg »MAP < 60mmHg 1.

What is shock? Inadequate cellular energy production leading to a critical decrease in oxygen delivery (DO2) in relation to oxygen consumption (VO2) Hypovolaemic Cardiogenic Distributive Obstructive Hypoxaemic Metabolic What is Shock? 21 1.

Describe the six main categories of shock and understand their aetiopathogenesis (hypovolaemic, cardiogenic, distributive, obstructive, metabolic and hypoxaemic) LO 5 2223 Hypovolaemic Shock • Decrease in blood volume (internal or external loss) • Excessive loss of other bodily fluids (urine, vomit, diarrhoea, burns) • Compensatory mechanisms are triggered to attempt to raise circulating blood volume “compensated shock” • Decompensated shock follows J. Charles 2020 24 Distributive Shock • A marked decrease in systemic vascular resistance (vasodilation) or maldistribution of blood • Examples include ➢ Sepsis (release of endotoxins, induction of pro-inflammatory cascades) ➢ Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) ➢ Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC, more next lecture) ➢ Anaphylactic shock (degranulation of mast cells and basophils) ➢ Catecholamine release (extreme fear, pheochromocytoma) J. Charles 2020 J. Charles 2020 25 Cardiogenic Shock • Failure of the heart to provide forward flow • This may be due to a systolic or diastolic failure – Loss of myocardial contractility – Dysrhythmia – Structural or mechanical failure The University of Surrey, 2019 The University of Surrey, 2019 • Pericardial effusion • Cardiac tamponade occurs when intrapericardial pressure equals or exceeds RV pressure. • CO is severely compromised and systemic venous pressure is substantially elevated. Obstructive Shock Vets Now Emergency Service, 2019 • A slow rise in pericardial pressure leads to signs of right sided congestion alongside low CO • Idiopathic PE • Neoplastic PE • A rapid rise in pericardial pressure can cause signs of poor CO alone without a large volume effusion • Left atrial rupture • Septic PE Pathophysiology Vets Now Emergency Service, 2019 • Cardiac tamponade is alleviated by pericardiocentesis and removal of a small quantity of fluid can cause rapid reduction in IP and relieve clinical signs. • It is not necessary to remove all of the pericardial fluid to achieve a beneficial haemodynamic effect Pathophysiology 30 Metabolic and Hypoxemic Shock Metabolic shock: Deranged cellular metabolic machinery ➢ Hypoglycemia ➢ Cyanide Toxicity ➢ Mitochondrial dysfunction Hypoxemic Shock: A decrease in oxygen content in arterial blood ➢ Anemia ➢ Carbon monoxide toxicity ➢ Methemoglobinemia 31 Shock is an emergency • In the compensatory stages the neurohormonal mechanisms are activated to maintain central venous pressure and O2 supply to the heart, brain and lungs • Neurohormonal mechanisms include ➢ release of glucocorticoids ➢ activation of the sympathetic nervous system ➢ release of catecholamines ➢ activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system ➢ release of anti-diuretic hormone ➢ release of aldosterone 32 Shock is an emergency • Early recognition of shock is vital • Aim to rapidly restore the cardiovascular system so that the delivery of O2 to tissues is normalised as soon as possible 33 ✓ Revise the terms cardiac output, stroke volume, contractility, afterload and preload ✓ Define and utilise the terms hypertension and hypotension in relation to domestic animals ✓ Understand the causes and potential consequences of systemic hypertension and explain why systemic hypertension tends to be a self-perpetuating phenomenon ✓ Define the term ‘shock’ and relate this to the ‘tree of life’ ✓ Describe the six main categories of shock and understand their aetiopathogenesis (hypovolaemic, cardiogenic, distributive, obstructive, metabolic and hypoxaemic)","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
