Introduction to clinical pathology 2. Laboratory evaluation of GI Case studies: Vomiting Diarrhoea Protein-losing enteropathy (PLE) Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) – Evaluating data and considering further tests What is clinical pathology? • Utilisation of laboratory tests to: – Diagnose disease – Narrow down differential diagnoses (DDx) – Direct further investigations – Monitor disease progression or response to therapy – Screen for underlying disease in clinically healthy animals How to use clinical pathology • Appropriate laboratory tests are selected after a full history and complete physical examination – Identify a problem list first, to ensure selection of appropriate and cost effective tests • Laboratory tests are frequently used in conjunction with other diagnostic procedures, as part of an integrated diagnostic approach: – e.g. imaging, endoscopy, laparotomy, biopsy, treatment trial Clinical pathology laboratory testing: Part of the “art” of veterinary medicine Fluid analysis Biochemistry UrinalysisHaematology Cytology Molecular diagnostics and serology Learning the lingo Common clinical pathology acronyms (CCPA just joking!) • Haematology – PCV: packed cell volume – Hct: haematocrit – Hb (or Hgb): haemoglobin concentration – RCC: red cell count – MCV: mean corpuscular volume – MCHC: mean corpuscular Hb concentration – RDW: red cell distribution width Learning the lingo – WCC: white cell count (aka leukocyte count) – TNCC: total nucleated cell count – Neut: neutrophil (aka seg or polymorph) – Lym (or Lymph): lymphocyte – Mono: monocyte – Eo: eosinophil – Baso: basophil – PLT: platelets (platelet count) – PDW: platelet distribution width Learning the lingo • Biochemistry: Electrolytes – Na: sodium – K: potassium – Cl: chloride – Mg: magnesium – Ca: calcium (may also be “Total calcium”) – Ca++: ionised calcium – PHOS: Phosphate – Anion Gap: calculated value: (Na+K) – (Cl+n) Plasma Serum Learning the lingo • Biochemistry – Urea: measured as BUN (blood urea nitrogen) in USA – Cr (or CREAT): creatinine – Gluc: glucose – Chol: cholesterol – Bili: bilirubin, usually “total bilirubin” – Bili Total ~ Unconjugated + Conjugated – BA: (serum total) bile acids Learning the lingo • Biochemistry: Enzymes – ALT: alanine aminotransferase (previously SGPT) – AST: aspartate aminotransferase (previously SGOT) – AP: alkaline phosphatase (aka ALP, AlkPhos) – GGT: gamma glutamyltransferase (aka gamma GT, gGT) – SDH: sorbitol dehydrogenase – GLDH: glutamate dehydrogenase – CK: creatine kinase (previously CPK) Learning the lingo • Biochemistry: More enzymes – TLI: (serum) trypsin-like immunoreactivity – Amylase: sometimes AMYL – Lipase: sometimes LIP – cPL: canine pancreatic-specific lipase – cPLI: canine pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity Learning the lingo • Biochemistry: Proteins – TP: total protein (measured biochemically) – TS: total solids (refractometer total protein value) – Alb: albumin – Glob: total globulins – A:G (ratio): Alb/Glob – Fib: fibrinogen – SPE: serum protein electrophoresis Learning the lingo • Urinalysis (UA): – USG: urine specific gravity (‘concentration’) – RBC: red blood cells (erythrocytes) – WBC: white blood cells (leukocytes) – #/LPF: number per low power field (x100 magnification) – #/HPF: number per high power field (x400 magnification) – TNTC: too numerous to count (lots and lots!) Learning the lingo • Miscellaneous: – Ag: antigen – Ab: antibody – EDTA: ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid – Ig: immunoglobulin – SDMA: symmetric dimethyl arginine – T4: thyroxine – T3: triiodothyronine Learning the lingo • Miscellaneous: – TPR: temperature, pulse (rate) and respiration (rate) – MN or MC: desexed male – FS: spayed female – NAD: no abnormalities detected – NS: not stated – WRI: within reference interval – WNL: within ’normal’ limits – (AbN: abnormal; N: normal) Learning the lingo • Diagnoses: – EPI: exocrine pancreatic insufficiency – DM: diabetes mellitus – DKA: diabetic ketoacidosis – DI: diabetes insipidus – HyperA: hyperadrenocorticism – HypoT: hypothyroidism – etc, etc, etc!! Choosin’ the tube Na or K EDTA Chelates Ca++ Haematology Na or Li heparin Anti- thrombin Plasma General biochemistry “Plain” tube Clots Serum General biochemistry Some specific tests Fluoride Oxalate tube Plasma Glucose (Lactate) Haematology • PCV and TS • Complete blood count (CBC) – Erythrocytes • Hct (PCV), Hb, RCC, MCV, MCHC – Leukocytes • Total and differential cell counts – Platelets • Blood smear examination – Cell morphology and validation of analyser results • Reticulocyte count Coagulation tests • ACT: activated coagulation time • APTT: activated partial thromboplastin time • PT: prothrombin time • TT: thrombin time • Fibrinogen • vWf (VWF): von Willebrand factor • FVIII: Factor VIII (similar for other Factors) Transfusion medicine • Blood typing – Performed when reagents (Ab) are available • DEA 1.1 in dogs • A, B and AB in cats • Cross-matching for compatibility – Major crossmatch • Donor’s RBC tested against recipient’s serum – Minor crossmatch • Donor’s serum tested against recipient’s RBC Diagnostic ‘groupings’ • Renal disease: urea, Cr, USG, SDMA • Electrolytes: Na, K, Cl • Acid Base: pH, bicarbonate, anion gap • Minerals: Ca, Phos, Mg • Muscle injury: CK, AST • Liver: ALT, GLDH, AST, ALP, GGT, bilirubin, bile acids • Pancreatic function: amylase, lipase, TLI • Energy metabolism: glucose, cholesterol • Proteins: TP, albumin (globulins) Biochemistry ‘profiles’ • Larger groupings of biochemistry tests – Will vary between laboratories Urinalysis • Testing the physical and chemical characteristics of fresh urine • Collection may be free-catch, catheter or cystocentesis • Assessment of: – Gross appearance and odour – Urine specific gravity (USG) – Urine ‘Dipstick’ chemistry – Urine sediment (microscopy) Image: Amrls.cvm.msu.edu Cytology The study of cells: • Fine needle aspirate (FNA) or impression smear – Skin masses, lymph node (LN) or tissue • Body fluids – Effusions: peritoneal, pleural, pericardial, synovial – Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) • Washes – Tracheal, prostatic, BAL • Swabs – Vaginal, skin lesions, ears, conjunctiva Inflammatory mass; macrophages with Mycobacteria 100x Sample collection • Avoid artifactual changes – Good venepuncture technique – Correct blood tube – Correct ratio of blood to anticoagulant – Harvest plasma or serum asap – Make ‘fresh’ blood smears – Gentle preparation techniques for tissue cytology Echinocytes? Crenation? The ideal patient • Is fasted and rested • Post-prandial samples may have: – Lipaemia – Hyperglycaemia – Mild azotaemia • Excited animals may have: – Erythrocytosis – Physiological leukocytosis – Hyperglycaemia In-house Laboratory • Simple In-house Laboratory • More sophisticated Referral Laboratory • ‘Out-sourcing’ – Quality control (QC) still begins with YOU! • Larger range of tests • Provides interpretative support • Contacts for referring samples Remember the old adageInterpretation of data • Providing a pertinent history is important! – The more information given to the laboratory, the better the interpretation and comments vs Interpretation of data • Ultimate responsibility for interpretation of lab results rests with you, the practitioner • You must understand the units, reference intervals and significance of abnormalities Units of measurement • Australia, Canada, Europe use SI units • USA still use ‘conventional’ units • For example: – PCV in SI of 0.45 L/L = 45% in USA – Total cell count 10 x 109/L = 10,000/ml – Glucose of 5.5 mmol/L = 100 mg/dL – TP of 75 g/L = 75 g/dL – Urea of 2.1 mmol/L = Urea nitrogen of 6 mg/dL Reference values • Reference values (or reference intervals) are results derived from a specified population of clinically healthy animals • They may vary according to: – Species – Breed – Age – Sex – Method of collection – Method of analysis Reference intervals • Define your population Reference intervals (values) • Reference intervals usually represent the test results from 95% of the reference (‘healthy’) population • Therefore ~ 2.5% of ‘healthy’ animals have values above, and ~ 2.5% below, the reference interval From Kaneko, JJ: Clinical biochemistry of domestic animals (1989) Warnings! • Always interpret lab results in conjunction with history, clinical findings and other tests • Anticipate expected findings, so that you can: – Question unexpected results – Identify pathological processes when lab results are within reference limits • e.g., an anaemic animal that is also dehydrated may have a ‘normal’ PCV More Warnings! • Do NOT over interpret mildly increased or decreased test results (especially if they are ‘unexpected’ or do not fit the clinical diagnosis) Final advice • The more information that you have steering you in the one diagnostic direction, the more certain you can be of the diagnosis • However, remember that common things occur commonly and do not succumb to the paralysis of over-analysis If you hear hoof-beats….. Think horses not zebras! You’ll be right 99% of the time (unless you’re on safari!) from Pixabay Laboratory evaluation of gut disease • Laboratory investigations are an important component of the diagnostic approach to gastrointestinal disease by: – Narrowing the list of differential diagnoses (DDx) – Providing a diagnosis in some cases – Directing further investigations • Baseline data: – Routine haematology, biochemistry, urinalysis Laboratory evaluation of GI disease • Possible other tests/procedures: – Imaging (radiographs, ultrasonography, etc.) – Effusion analysis (TNCC/TP, cytology) – Endocrine (hyperthyroidism, hypoadrenocorticism) – Pancreas (pancreatitis, EPI) – Folate/Cobalamin (intestinal function) – Mass lesions: FNA for cytology or surgical biopsy for histopathology – Faecal tests V & D • How do vomiting and diarrhoea affect haematology and biochemistry values?

Evaluating Na and Cl • Chloride and sodium should move together when changes only relate to water • Determining if there is a selective loss or gain of chloride, helps refine DDx and also suggests an acid base disturbance Calculate “corrected Cl” Cl(cor)= Cl (measured) x (normal Na ÷ measured Na) * normal Na is midpoint of Na ref interval * Cl cor should be within the Cl ref interval Evaluating Na and Cl • Corrected Cl = 70 x (152/123) = 86.5 • The corrected Cl value is not within the Cl reference interval – thus selective Cl loss is confirmed • Gastric vomiting, concern for pyloric obstruction • Metabolic alkalosis very likely (need blood gas to confirm) Na mmol/L 123 144-160 (152) Cl mmol/L 70 109-122 Case 1: Outcome • Placed on intravenous fluids to correct electrolyte balance and restore hydration • Imaging revealed a likely foreign body • Exploratory laparotomy was performed • A foreign body was found to be obstructing the pylorus • Sandy made a full recovery!
