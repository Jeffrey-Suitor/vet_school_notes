Ligand-gated ion channels 2. 3. 4. Nuclear receptors (class I and class II) ➢ Discuss the mechanism of nuclear receptor activation • Be able to give an example of each. • Describe how different types of G proteins (Gs, Gi ,Gq, Gt signalling) can be linked to different intracellular signalling pathways • Describe how endothelial cells can be stimulated to produce nitric oxide, causing dilation of smooth muscle. • Describe how enzyme-linked receptors, such as growth factor receptors and the insulin receptor, activate downstream effector proteins. • Understand how some hormones act through intra-cellular receptors, leading to changes in gene transcription via hormone response elements.

Ach binds Muscarinic M3 receptor linked to Gq protein on endothelial cell 2. Causes cascade that activates NO synthase (eNOS) 3. Arginine converted to citrulline + NO 4. NO diffuses into adjacent smooth muscle cells 5. NO activates cytosolic guanylyl cyclase 6. cGTP is converted to cGMP 7. cGMP activates protein kinase G which phosphorylates muscle proteins to induce muscle relaxation – more blood flow • Small, toxic gas • Acts locally • Short ½ life of 5-10 sec • Endogenous NO release stimulated by bradykinin, acetylcholine, adenine nucleotides M3 Ach Gt proteins & phosphodiesterase Phototransduction in the retina • Boron & Boulpaep 2012 Closes cation channels Na+ & Ca2+ Rhodopsin Slide 9 Diversity of G Protein-Coupled receptor signal transduction pathways G-protein families +  signalling Decrease cGMP Gt Slide 10Slide 11 Examples – ion channel vs G protein transduction  signalling • Ionotropic receptor ➢Nicotinic Ach receptor ➢Opens Na+ ion channel Ø Membrane depolarization Ø Action potential produced Ø Muscle contraction Skeletal muscle • Metabotropic receptor ➢ Muscarinic receptor ➢ G protein activated ➢  subunit activates K+ channel ➢ Opens K+ ion channel ➢ Membrane hyperpolarization ➢ Decreased heart rate • Cardiac muscle Boron & Boulpaep 2nd ed 2012 G protein-coupled receptors 2nd messengers Effector enzyme 2nd messenger Adenylyl cyclase cAMP Phospholipase C Inositol (1,4,5) trisphosphate (IP3) & Diacylglycerol (DAG) Ligand or signal Adrenaline (epinephrine) Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) Angiotensin II (epithelial cells) Catecholamine ( receptors) Acetylcholine (ACh, via a muscarinic receptor) Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) Corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) Glucagon Vasopressin (V2 receptor - epithelial cells) Angiotensin II (vascular smooth muscle) Catecholamine ( receptors) Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) Growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) Oxytocin Thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) Vasopressin (V1 receptor - vascular smooth muscle) Nitric oxide Atrial natriuretic hormone Light Guanylyl cyclase (+) Phosphodiesterase (-) Slide 12 cGMP Activation of receptor kinase Slide 13 http://membranereceptors.com/Test2/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Enzyme-linkedreceptors1.jpg Slide 14 Mechanism of action of insulin • Activates insulin receptor substrates (IRS) via tyrosine kinase receptor Growth factor receptors Slide 15 Functional classes of hormones • Water soluble • Amines (other than thyroid hormones) • Peptides & proteins, Eicosanoids 1. First messenger (hormone) binds to membrane receptor 2. Activated receptor sets off cascade that activates an enzyme 3. Enzyme reaction produces a second messenger (eg cAMP) 4. Second messenger produces response in cell • Lipid soluble • Steroids • Thyroid hormones (amines), Nitric oxide 1. Diffuse through plasma membrane (except thyroid hormones transported ) 2. Bind to specific receptors in cytoplasm or nucleus 3. Hormone & receptor bind to DNA 4. Gene is transcribed or deactivated Receptors (>80 identified) include those for: 11 Corticosteroids (glucocorticoid, mineralocorticoid) cytoplasm 11 Sex hormone receptors (estrogen, testosterone) 11 Thyroid hormone receptors (nuclear) Source : Marieb, 2012 Transduction differences Slide 16 Class I Nuclear Receptors -Steroids http://human.freescience.org/htmx/nuclear_receptor.php 1.

NR located in nucleus 2. Thyroid hormone receptor (TR) heterodimerized to the retinoic acid receptor RXR. 3. TR is bound to corepressor protein. OFF 4. Ligand binding to TR causes a dissociation of corepressor and recruitment of coactivator protein ON 5. Activate RNA polymerase that are responsible for transcription For example, Thyroid hormones Key aspects of hormone signalling 1. Specificity: • A high receptor ligand specificity • Non-covalent interactions 2. Amplification • First messengers are often short-lived and in low concentrations • Induce key intracellular signalling proteins to behave as a molecular switch. • Amplification proceeds usually via enzyme cascades 3. Integration • Cells frequently receive multiple signals • Must be coordinated with integrated cellular response 4. Rapid decay • Hormones give short-term, reversible messages so system must decay relatively rapidly. 5. Desensitization • Often achieved by a feedback loop • The target may be the receptor – affinity, activity or expression Slide 19 Summary: receptor-linked transduction pathways Slide 19 [ R = receptor, G = G protein, E = enzyme]","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
