She briefly worked in mixed animal practice in Kerala before moving to Australia. Smitha then worked as a research scientist in the Department of Medicine, Monash University. In 2015, she completed the National Veterinary Examination and started small animal practice in Melbourne. She started her career as an anatomic pathologist in 2018 when she joined the Melbourne university as a lecturer. She became a diplomate of the American College of Veterinary Pathologists in 2021. Her research interests are in epithelial cancers affecting the skin, oral cavity, and oesophagus, and is an author of several publications Email: s.georgy@unimelb.edu.au LECTURE 17 – PERTURBATIONS OF FLOW II – THROMBOSIS Thrombosis is the inappropriate formation of a blood clot (thrombus) within the cardiovascular system. Thrombosis similar to haemostasis is a clotting process involving platelets, clotting factors and endothelial cells. The resultant thrombus protrudes at least partially into the lumen of the affected vessel and may, therefore, interfere with blood flow. Three major mechanisms can be responsible for thrombosis: vascular endothelial injury, hypercoagulability of blood, and/or altered haemodynamics. Of these, endothelial injury is the most important trigger. Once formed, a thrombus may continue to enlarge (propagation) due to continued blood coagulation occurring on its surface. Thrombi may resolve via the process of fibrinolysis catalysed by plasmin (particularly in the period soon after thrombosis occurs) or via organisation by phagocytic macrophages and ingrowth of endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts. Thrombi may also undergo fragmentation, yielding thromboemboli that can pass downstream to become trapped in smaller calibre blood vessels. The gross appearance of thrombi and its consequences are discussed.
