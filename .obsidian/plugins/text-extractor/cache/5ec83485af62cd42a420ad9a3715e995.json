Describe the main signal transduction pathways involved in cell signalling Ligand-gated ion channels1. 2. G-protein coupled receptors, 3. 4. • Receptor enzymes (i.e., tyrosine kinase), Nuclear receptors (class I and class II) Be able to give an example of each. 2. Explain through the use of examples how a G protein signal transduction pathway is regulated 3. Describe how bacterial toxins such as cholera toxin are able to interfere with heterotrimeric G protein signalling. Slide 2 Signal transduction - conversion of signals into cellular responses Hormone receptors exhibit: • Specificity, Affinity, Saturability, Reversibility (deactivation) • Cell surface or intracellular • Activate cellular responses (ion channel permeability, enzymes or changes in gene expression) Slide 3 Cellular Signalling Cascade signal receptor Primary transduction (conformational change) Relay (modulation by other factors) Amplification (second messengers; enzymes) Divergence to multiple targets Responses (altered metabolism; gene expression; movement etc) Switch on Termination Slide 4(Then appropriate controls and feedback pathways terminate the response)[ R = receptor, G = G protein, E = enzyme] Main types of signal transduction pathways Rang et al, 2003Slide 5 Catalytic No transduction Mechanism – ion current Second messenger cAMP, cGMP, DAG, IP3 and Ca++ Receptor is an enzyme or part of enzyme complex Receptor is cytosolic or nuclear • Berne, Levy, Koeppen & Stanton 2004 Slide 6 Signal transduction pathways & second messengers Slide 7 Ligand gated ion channels • Many ion channels open or close in response to binding a ligand. • Some ion channels are gated by extracellular ligands; some by intracellular ligands. • External ligands E.g. Acetylcholine (ACh). • Ionotropic receptor • Nicotinic Ach receptor • Opens Na+ ion channel • Depolarization Boron & Boulpaep 2nd ed 2012 G-protein coupled receptors G proteins (guanine nucleotide-binding proteins) • Largest family of cell surface receptors o (>1000 genes encode for GPCRs) • 7 transmembrane domains • Coupled to intracellular effector systems via G- proteins • Includes receptors for many hormones and transmitters o Examples: muscarinic AChR; adrenergic receptor Slide 8 Basic components of a GPCR-mediated signalling system GPCR effector molecule heterotrimeric G protein e.g AT1 (angiotensin) adrenergic muscarinic E  At least 23  12 and 6  subunits Phospholipase A2 Phospholipase C Adenylate cyclase calcium channels second messenger generation phosphorylation of cytosolic and nuclear proteins cellular response to stimulus G proteins & GPCRs G proteins (guanine nucleotide-binding proteins) Slide 9 GPCRs: Function of the G protein Response depends on the effector protein G subunits can also activate downstream effectors Slide 10 G protein activation Adrenalin Slide 11 Stryer 1995 Adrenaline/adrenergic receptor 1. G protein  subunit with GTP activates adenylyl cyclase 2. Adenylyl cyclase hydrolyses ATP to cAMP 3. cAMP binds to PKA regulatory subunit and releases the PKA catalytic unit 4. Catalytic unit is phosphorylated 5. Activated PKA phosphorylates glycogen phosphorylase enzyme 6. Glycogen broken down to glucose Slide 12 Figure 3-6 Activation of protein kinase A by cAMP. Downloaded from: StudentConsult (on 21 April 2012 12:36 A © 2005 Elsevier Activation Protein kinase A by cAMP SMl)ide 13 Signal amplification through G proteins Slide 14 Important regulatory control points 1. Ligand- Receptor interaction • Activation via the G protein system occurs only while hormone-receptor conjugates persist • Depends on hormone concentration & lifespan in blood • Many receptor hormone conjugates are internalized and ‘new’ receptors expressed o Ligand-induced receptor internalisation through clathrin- coated pits • Proteins called -arrestins bind to GPCR and downregulate a response to prolonged hormone exposure (desensitization) • Inactivate GPCR • Promote removal by endocytosis Slide 15 Important regulatory control points G proteins molecular switch 2. “Ground state\" G protein reforms resulting in the deactivation of adenylate cyclase. Slide 16 Important regulatory control points 3. Degradation of cAMP is catalysed by specific a phosphodiesterase • cAMP → AMP 4. Intracellular protein phosphatases • Remove the phosphate groups from the key enzymes affected by their addition in the first place. • Eg, deactivation of protein kinase A etc • The balance between kinases (adding phosphates) and phosphatases (removing) activity plays a major role in the control of signalling events. Slide 17 Phosphodiesterase enzyme breaks down cAMP (regulatory control) PDE enzyme inhibitors: Caffeine, theophylline Slide 18Slide 19 OH OH O P O P Reversible phosphorylation plus ATP kinase phosphatase conformational change change in function change in location tyrosine, threonine or serine residue What do kinases do?? Slide 20 Cholera toxin and G proteins Cholera toxin inhibits G protein hydrolysis -Switched on longer Slide 21 Effect of Cholera toxin on salt and water balance http://www.chegg.com • • 1. Cholera toxin enters intestinal crypt cells across the apical membrane 2. The toxin  subunit detaches and catalyses ADP ribosylation (addition of a ribosome unit) of the Gs protein coupled to adenylyl cyclase Inhibits GTPase activity and GTP cannot be hydrolysed back to GDP 3. GTP remains permanently bound to Gs subunit Adenylyl cyclase remains activated 4. cAMP levels 100x higher than normal 5. Cytosolic PKA is over-activated 6. PKA phosphorylates cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl- channel proteins ATP-mediated secretion of Cl- ions 7. Leads to secretion of other ions and 8. Water loss of up to 2L/h Balanced Consequence: severe dehydration and diarrhoea Slide 22 http://yakko.bme.virginia.edu/biom204/slides/cholera_bnw.pdf Pertussis toxin – increases cAMP by blocking Gi Toxins 2011, 3(7), 884-899 Slide 23 Summary Key events in signal transduction: 1. Recognition (Receptor specificity) 2/3. Transduction / transmission • Ligand binding causes a conformational change in the receptor • Triggers catalytic activities to the receptor or causes the receptor to interact with cytoplasmic or membrane enzymes. • Second messengers • Activate catalytic cascade & effectors 4. Modulation of an effector. • protein kinases, phosphatases - altering enzyme activity. 5. Appropriate response of cell to initial stimulus. • Summation and integration of multiple signalling pathways. 6. Termination of response. • Inbuilt controls and feedback pathways.","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
