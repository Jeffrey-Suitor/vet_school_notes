Must be in diet. Conditional essentiality Biological Value Amount of absorbed protein that is retained by animal Limiting amino acids aa found in the lowest quantity in a feedstuff relative to requirements, thus limiting protein construction • arginine • histidine • isoleucine • lysine • leucine • methionine • phenylalanine • threonine • tryptophan • valine • taurine Essential amino acidsLimiting amino acids  Main limiting aa is LYSINE, then Threonine Ideal Protein g/kg diet % of ideal in barley Lysine 70 49 Threonine 42 83 Methionine & Cysteine 35 92 Leucine 70 97 Valine 49 110 Protein Peptides Microbial Protein Dietary protein Protein metabolism in the rumen Amino acids Ammonia Urea in blood plasma Dietary non-protein N + salivary urea Dietary protein + Microbial protein Lipids • Lipids – fats (animal based) and oils (plant based) – Simple lipids e.g. triglycerides – Compound lipids e.g. phosholipids – Others: waxes, steroids etc • Energy storage mechanism • Essential Fatty Acids Essential Fatty Acids 20:4 n6 Arachidonic Acid Linoleic Acid (18:2 n6)  6 Desaturase 18:3 n6 elongase 20:3 n6 5 Desaturase Fibre Soluble Fermentable to physiologically active compounds (& gases) Insoluble Metabolically inert.
