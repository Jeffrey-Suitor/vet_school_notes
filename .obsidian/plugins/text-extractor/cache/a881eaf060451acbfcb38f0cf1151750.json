S L I DE 3 9 (Ha e m a t o x yl i n a nd E o s i n ) Link: http://www.best.edu.au/s/cqkfxq1x This section, from a sheep, shows a liver in which classical lobules are not demarcated by any connective tissue septa. It is nonetheless possible to discern classical lobules by reference to the central lobular (hepatic) veins, the portal canals and their enclosed portal triads (hepatic artery, portal vein, bile duct), and the radial pattern of the liver cell cords. Draw a low power diagram to illustrate the nature of at least three adjoining \"classical\" lobules. Mark in this drawing, in dotted outlines, the areas occupied by a \"portal lobule\" and an \"acinus\". To illustrate the nature of liver tissue, draw a medium power diagram of each of the following: a) a portal canal and its contained triad b) a central lobular vein and the immediately adjacent cords of hepatocytes and their related sinusoids. In which directions do blood and bile flow within the classical lobule? Along what channels does bile flow within the lobule? Why are these channels not visible in this section? S L I DE 4 0 (V an G i es o n ) Link: http://www.best.edu.au/s/a6vh7mwe This section, from the liver of a pig, shows the collagenous septa which so clearly demarcate the liver lobules in this species. What explanations can you offer for the apparent variability in the size and shape of the lobules in this section? S L I DE 4 1 (H a e m a to x y l i n a n d Eo s i n ) Link: http://www.best.edu.au/s/n5t41bj6 This section is from the liver of a rat into which an intravenous injection of Indian ink was made some time before death. The presence of some phagocytic cells, which are black due to their high content of engulfed ink (carbon) particles, is obvious in many of the sinusoids. What is the name of these phagocytic cells? What would be their function in life?
