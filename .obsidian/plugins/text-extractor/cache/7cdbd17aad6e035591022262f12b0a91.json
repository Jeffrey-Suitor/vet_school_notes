Where does it all start? Gastrulation Inner cell mass ≈ embryo Cross section McGeady, 2017, Fig. 11.6 (ad.) Senger, 2003, Fig. 13.4 (ad.)

The primitive gut T McGeady, 2017, Fig. 18.2 The primitive gut • within the embryo: – Foregut – Midgut – Hindgut yolk sac • extraembryonic: – yolk sac – allantois Derivatives of the gut tube Derived from the foregut: • Parts of the oral cavity • Pharynx / Oesophagus • Stomach/ prox duodenum • Liver and pancreas • Thyroid / parathyroid/ thymus • Trachea and Lungs Derived from the hindgut: • Distal part of transverse colon to descending colon • Cloaca → anal canal / urogenital sinus Derived from the midgut: • Duodenum to transverse colon → think about blood supply! Embryology of the digestive system Learning objectives • Describe the derivatives of the primitive gut tube (fore-, mid-, hindgut) • Explain the developmental anatomy in the embryo of the mouth and associated structures, including the tongue. • Discuss the developmental anatomy of the oesophagus, stomach and intestines Derivatives of the gut tube Derived from the foregut: • Parts of the oral cavity • Pharynx / Oesophagus • Stomach/ prox duodenum • Liver and pancreas • Thyroid / parathyroid/ thymus • Trachea and Lungs Derived from the hindgut: • Distal part of transverse colon to descending colon • Cloaca → anal canal / urogenital sinus Derived from the midgut: • Duodenum to transverse colon → think about blood supply! Development of the Mouth Stomodaeum = ectodermal depression at rostral end of embryo Oropharyngeal membrane stomodaeumepithelium of mouth is ectodermal Oropharyngeal membrane = membrane composed of ectoderm and endoderm which separates stomodeum from foregut Formation of facial region Pharyngeal arches & Fronto-nasal prominence contribute to head and neck formation stomodaeum Fronto-nasal prominence McGeady, 2017, Fig. 22.1 (ad.) Fronto-nasal prominence • Gives rise to: – Frontal process – 2 lateral nasal processes – 2 medial nasal processes Frontal process McGeady, 2017, Fig. 22.3 (ad.) Fronto-nasal prominence Fronto-nasal prominence differentiation Frontonasal prominence stomodeum DIFFERENTIATION Noden, 1985 1st Pharyngeal Arch foregut = mandibular arch • Left and Right Maxillary process • Left and Right Mandibular process • Elongation of these processes forms the oral cavity McGeady, 2017, Fig. 22.4 (ad.)Noden, 1985, Fig. 9.7McGeady, 2017, Fig. 22.3 (ad.) Facial Development Processes fuse: • Upper jaw/ lips – Naso-medial processes + maxillary processes • Nose – Frontal process + naso-lateral processes • Lower jaw/ lips – Fusion of the mandibular processes Video showing facial development https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFY_KPFS3LA Normal Species variation • Upper lip anatomy – Sheep- cleft upper lip – Carnivore -groove in upper lip – Horse/ cattle smooth upper lip Normal Species variation • Dolocephalic vs BrachycephalicWhich processes failed to fuse in this puppy? Development of the oral cavity (= primary palate) Caudal part atrophies Large tongue reaching into nasal cavity Oral cavity grows faster than tongue Sulcus between lips/ cheeks and gingiva forms McGeady, 2017, Fig. 22.5 (ad.) Division of the oro-nasal cavity Secondary palate derives from: • lateral palatine processes (2) • Maxillary process (rostral) Cleft palate • Failure of palatine processes (but not maxillary processes) to fuse • Serious consequences for suckling neonate Development of the tongue • Mesenchymal swellings: 1. Median tongue swelling 2. Two lateral tongue swellings 3. hypopharyngeal swellings • Arises from the floor of the pharynx atrophies McGeady, 2017, Fig. 22.8 (ad.) foregut Oropharyngeal membrane stomodaeum Development of the tongue • Mesenchymal swellings: 1. Median tongue swelling 2. Two lateral tongue swellings 3. hypopharyngeal swellings • Arises from the floor of the pharynx Body = ectoderm Root = endoderm atrophies McGeady, 2017, Fig. 22.8 (ad.)

Formation of the oesophagus • Narrowed cranial end of the foregut • Elongation occurs during growth → Epithelium and glands are endoderm derived → Connective tissue and muscle layer are partially derived from mesoderm → Striated muscle derived from caudal pharyngeal arches Formation of the stomach • Midline spindle shape swelling of foregut Dorsal surface grows faster → greater curvature Ventral surface grows slower → lesser curvature LOCATION?! McGeady, 2017, Fig. 18.7 (ad.) Formation of the stomach • Stomach rotation – Rotates so that the greater curvature is first to the left and then caudo-ventral – Enlarged dorsal mesogastrium (mesoderm) elongates to form the greater omentum spleen Dorsal mesogastrium Lesser omentum Falciform lig. liver liver Omental bursa Greater omentum spleen For. epiploicum McGeady, 2017, Fig18.4 (ad.)
