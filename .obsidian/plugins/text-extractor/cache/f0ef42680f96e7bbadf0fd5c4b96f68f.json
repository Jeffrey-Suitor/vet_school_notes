Cattle breeds • About 9,000 year ago domestication of two sub-species occurred, zebu cattle (Bos indicus) in South Asia and European cattle (Bos taurus) in Eurasia. • Most Bos Indicus cattle in Australia are crossbreeds with Bos Taurus (e.g., Brahman, Brangus, Belmont Red) Cattle breeds • Beef (e.g., Angus, Hereford, Charolais) and dairy (e.g., Holstein, Jersey) breeds • General temperament: Bos indicus cattle > beef cattle > dairy cattle (although dairy bulls are considered more aggressive than beef bulls) • Breed affects temperament but so does age and previous experience Herd behaviour • Living in a herd provides safety in numbers • Also a good strategy to find food, water and shelter • Cattle are not territorial, but have a ‘home range’. • Naturally herds consist of females and their offspring • Adult males live in bachelor groups • Strong social structure, complex hierarchy, little aggression • Affiliative behaviour and special bonds between individuals Grazing behaviour • Grazing in the morning and late afternoon • Spent 10-14hrs lying (resting and ruminating) • Behavioural synchronisation • Time budget of dairy cows is driven by twice daily milking Sensing the world • Eyes on the side of the head means wide field of vision (300 degrees) • Sensitive to movement and contrast, can cause escape response • Ears rotate to the direction of sound • Smell and vocalisation important for social communication • Most social communication through body language • Ear, head, tail, body position and movement are used for communication • Facial expressions may indicate emotion, look for wrinkling under the eye, the white of the eye, drooping ears Show of aggression • Mostly use of threats (stare, head tossing, foot stamping) • Aggression mainly head butting, can be deadly particularly with horned cattle (sometimes charging) • May charge when they perceive a threat (for example dog) • Kicking or striking, can be either aggressive or defensive • Escape attempts when fearful, can be dangerous both to the animal and to humans Handling of cattle • Be aware of point of balance • Move animals in groups • Use as little pressure as possible, give them time • Food can help to move animals • Watch their body language and look out for fear and threats Natural behaviour of cattle https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7B2-M14YAs Communication of cattle https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2pb4Vbrz2c Aggressive cow https://www.youtube.com/watch/L9WQaxr3lrA","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
