KEYWORDS alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH), sorbitol dehydrogenase (SDH), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), cholestasis, bilirubin, hyperbilirubinaemia, bilirubinuria, jaundice/icterus LECTURE 5 – LABORATORY INVESTIGATION OF THE LIVER AND BILIARY SYSTEM 1 The liver is a key organ in the body for metabolism and excretion. Liver disease can have acute (active) and/or chronic manifestations. Laboratory tests afford the opportunity to confirm such diseases and rationally determine appropriate further diagnostic procedures and/or treatment. There is no single laboratory test that adequately identifies liver disease – thus a combination of tests is used to assess the hepatobiliary system. This lecture will explain how clinical pathology tests assist in the detection of active hepatocellular and biliary disease in the major domestic animal species, with a focus on enzymatic assays which help evaluate hepatocellular injury and cholestasis. Bilirubin metabolism and excretion and the mechanisms and diagnosis of various types of jaundice will be discussed. Specific species variations which affect test selection and interpretation will be identified. FURTHER READING Latimer KS. Duncan and Prasse’s Veterinary Laboratory Medicine.
