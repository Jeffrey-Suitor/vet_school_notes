I wish to thank my wife and colleague, Debbie, for her support over the years and my children, Heather and Matt, for tolerating my time-consuming career.

I appreciate their support of me and of my efforts in projects such as this book. Don Thrall","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
