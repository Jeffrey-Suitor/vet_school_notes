It describes best-practice techniques for a number of husbandry practices used when managing sheep. It can help producers provide good health, welfare and management outcomes for their livestock. We recognise that there are major variations in sheep production across Australia. That means that the implementation of recommendations in the document may differ from one area to another. A producers guide to sheep husbandry practices provides information from a range of research and on-farm experience that will enhance animal welfare and potentially improve production outcomes. It has been put together following extensive consultation with a wide range of groups, individuals, welfare organisations, industry bodies, and people with expertise in sheep husbandry. This guide provides up-to-date information on the best animal health and welfare practices for people working in the sheep industry. Animal welfare and management on-farm can affect the long term success of farming enterprises and the sheep industry. Sheepmeat Council of Australia recommends this booklet as a practical, easy-to-follow guide on animal health and welfare practices for anyone involved in the sheep industry.

Some sheep husbandry skills have only one acceptable method, for example mouthing sheep or administering intramuscular injections. If more than one accepted practice exists, (eg identifying sheep), advice is provided on best-practice technique in reference to the current Australian Model Code of Practice for the Welfare of Animals: The Sheep (second edition), the proposed Australian Animal Welfare Standards and Guidelines for Sheep (www.animalwelfarestandards.net.au), published scientific literature and opinions of recognised experts, while adhering to the criteria listed below. •\tPotential\tfor\tadverse\teffects\t(eg\taspiration\tpneumonia,\t bleeding, drowning, infection or transmission of disease). •\tOptimal\teffectiveness,\tso\tthe\tmethod\tachieves\tits\taim. •\tHigh\tstandard\tof\tanimal\twelfare,\tparticularly\tthe\t avoidance of pain, injury or distress. •\tHigh\tstandard\tof\tworkplace\thealth\tand\tsafety,\tincluding\t reducing exposure to insecticide concentrates, sheep blood, urine and other body fluids, and sharp cutting tools. •\tPromotion\tof\tworkplace\tproductivity,\tallowing\tlarge\t numbers of sheep to be processed efficiently, without compromising operator safety or animal welfare. In preparing this booklet, the authors only assessed the methods available at the time (late 2012) and did not include potential options for the future. The booklet does not cover all sheep husbandry skills. Skills not covered in this booklet might be covered elsewhere, such as Making More From Sheep published by Meat & Livestock Australia and Australian Wool Innovation, and in sheep husbandry information published by state departments of agriculture or primary industries. If needed, this best practice guide will be revised within five years to accommodate advances in husbandry practices and in legislative standards for good sheep welfare.

Mustering, yarding and handling Successful sheep handling depends on understanding and taking advantage of the natural behaviour of sheep. Sheep handling usually involves four key components: the sheep; humans or their substitutes (dogs or machines); facilities; and the treatments being undertaken. If all of these components are approached from the perspective of natural sheep behaviour, handling will be less stressful and safer for both sheep and their handlers. Sheep behaviour Vision Sheep have a wide angle of vision up to 300 degrees depending on the length of wool on the head. Because of this wide angle of vision, they are easily frightened by people and movements outside the pen or race; solid sides to races and pens will help prevent this. Sheep have excellent distance vision, but relatively weak eye muscles that make it difficult for them to focus quickly on close objects. Sheep have a blind spot directly below their muzzle and will slow or stop if they see changes on the ground ahead. Having handling facilities with floors of consistent materials, without grates, puddles, shadows or a change in flooring surface or texture, will allow a steady flow of sheep through the handling facilities. Sheep are sensitive to sudden movements and to anything that has a high contrast of light and dark. Handling facilities in one consistent colour are preferable. Ensure buildings that sheep are moved into have ample natural light and take advantage of sheep’s preference to move into brightly lit areas. Sheep can recognise faces of other sheep and other animals (ie humans and dogs). Hearing Sheep rely much more on their sight than hearing. They are more sensitive to loud noise than humans, especially sudden high intensity sounds (engines, vehicle horns, shouting, loud dog barking) and are easily frightened by these sounds. Avoid loud noises or shouting near sheep. Dogs should be trained not to bark excessively. Use rubber stops on gates to reduce noise and avoid the clanging of hanging metal and the rattling of chains. Pipe the exhaust of pneumatic equipment away from the handling area. Low level noises such as rattles or rustling plastic can be used to move sheep; however, if sheep become excited they may not respond to these sounds. 4 A producer’s guide to sheep husbandry practices Social behaviour Sheep are flock animals and naturally live in highly coordinated family or bachelor groups. Lambs learn about their surroundings from close association with their mothers. When threatened, sheep will form tight groups and move away and this can be taken advantage of during handling. Because of their flocking nature, sheep are calmer when they have body contact with other sheep. Sheep become highly stressed when separated from their flock mates, even when they can hear each other. Sheep, particularly Merinos, develop relationships and sub- groups within a flock. Sub-groups are commonly based on breed, age and sex, with sheep using their acute vision to tell familiar from unfamiliar sheep. Handling that involves separating groups will be difficult for a handler, while keeping sub-groups together will be much easier. Handling can disrupt the relationships between sheep, especially when there is crowding during yarding or mixing of flocks. If given the chance, sheep will re-sort themselves into their original sub-group; take advantage of this when sorting and handling sheep. Isolation of single sheep should be avoided. Isolated sheep can become frantic and injure their handlers or themselves. Sheep like to maintain visual contact with each other and readily follow a leader. Let sheep follow a leader at their own speed and do not rush them. Concentrate on moving the leaders rather than pushing the animals from the rear. During mustering keep the tail of the mob together and carry unfit sheep or lambs in a vehicle. Orphan lambs (poddies) do not learn to fear the person that raised them, which can be taken advantage of during handling. As adults, poddies can be used to lead a mob, for instance to bring a mob in or through the yards. Because sheep become used to their surroundings, they will return to their home paddock on their own after handling if given the opportunity. Take advantage of the homing behaviour of sheep during handling by providing laneways for the sheep to return to their home paddock. Sheep move within and between their familiar paddocks on well-defined tracks. Make use of this natural instinct by taking sheep to and from the yards by the same route every time. Sheep usually have a regular daily program of grazing and resting at set times and locations within their home paddock. Use this to locate sheep within their paddock at certain times of the day. Introducing sheep to new paddocks can lead to problems because the sheep will be unfamiliar with the sources of water or best feed. When introduced to new paddocks sheep tend to stay at the site of introduction, so make sure this is close to water and good feed. Alternatively, sheep should be taken to the water and food source in a new paddock. Breed Breeds of sheep can differ in their behavioural characteristics. Merinos tend to bunch or flock together, which is an advantage during handling. They also graze in a group formation. British breeds are more independent and split into small groups or graze alone. Sheep seek out others of the same breed. Make use of this breed preference when sorting sheep. Sex Sheep show some sex-dependent behaviour. Ewes are more independent than males because the ewe-lamb bond takes precedence over the flock. Groups of wethers have more consistent leadership orders. Understanding this difference can make handling easier. Age In young lambs, social attachment and following behaviour is based on the ewe and as the lamb ages, social attachment becomes more focussed on the flock. Because of this, groups of lambs or ewes with young lambs may not be as easy to muster as adult groups. Ewes and lambs will become distressed if separated. Very small lambs may struggle to keep up. Muster ewe-lamb mobs gently and let the lambs rest. Carry lambs that cannot keep up. 5A producer’s guide to sheep husbandry practices Muster ewes with lambs at an easy walking pace. Experience Sheep learn quickly, especially when young. Sheep remember and try to avoid painful or frightening experiences and will seek out positive experiences, especially those with a food reward. Take advantage of the natural learning ability of sheep. •\tUse\tgentle\thandling\ttechniques.\tAvoid\tshouting\tand\t loud noises. Do not strike sheep with canes, pipes or sticks. Do not use electric prodders on sheep. Do not hold onto the wool while catching or restraining sheep. Use the minimum restraint needed to get the job done. Use appropriate handling devices, operated by well trained staff. •\tFamiliarise\tsheep\twith\tthe\tyards\tand\trace\t configurations. Set up additional yards close to the paddocks. •\tTrain\tyoung\tsheep\tto\ta\tfamiliar\troutine.\tUse\tthe\tsame\t route to and from the yards every time. It is not best practice to use electric prodders on sheep. Electric prodders should only be used when there are no other options available. Consider the welfare of sheep when using an electric prodder, and do not use it on genital, anal, udder or facial areas of sheep, on lambs less than three months of age, or on sheep that are unable to move away. Stock handling skills Good stock handling skills and well trained dogs help ensure a successful outcome when handling sheep and are more important than good yards alone. Stock handling skills include three key skills based on the natural behaviour of sheep – observation, interpretation and action. Sheep naturally prefer to avoid contact with humans or dogs, and this preference is used to move and yard sheep. Humans come in direct contact with sheep during handling procedures, which is stressful for sheep, especially if they are overly fearful of humans because of previous rough handling or painful procedures. Each sheep or group of sheep is surrounded by a ‘flight zone’ or personal space. If a person moves into the space, the sheep will move away, or if the person moves in too close, the sheep will move towards and past the person. The size of the flight zone is reduced if a person approaches rapidly or from the front of the animal, and if sheep are on their own, confined or not used to human contact. Take advantage of the flight zone when handling sheep by using two landmarks on their body. The first is just behind the shoulder; forcing from behind this point moves the sheep forward and from in front of this point moves the sheep back. The second is between the eyes, with movement to the left resulting in the sheep moving to the right and vice versa. Take advantage of the flight zone when handling sheep by using two landmarks on their body, one just behind the shoulder and one between the eyes. 6 A producer’s guide to sheep husbandry practices •\tcurved\tlead-up\tyards\t •\tcovered\trace\tsides\tor\tstrategic\tuse\tof\tcovered\tand\t uncovered sides, with covered sides that hide visual distractions that slow down sheep movement and open sides to show things that speed up sheep movement (moving sheep, exits) •\tdouble\traces\tto\tallow\tefficient\thandling\tand\tloading\t •\ta\tgood\tdrafting\trace\t •\tgood\tdrainage\tof\tyards\tand\tlanes\t •\tflat\tfloors\tof\tconsistent\tmaterials,\twithout\tgrates,\tpuddles,\t shadows or a change in flooring surface or texture •\tone\tconsistent\tcolour\t •\tdiffuse\tlighting\twith\ta\tminimum\tof\tshadows\tand\tdark\tareas •\twide\tgates\t •\trubber\tstops\ton\tgates\tand\tno\tloose\tchain\tends,\twhich\t may rattle and distract sheep •\ta\tshaded\twork\tarea\t •\tfresh\tdrinking\twater\tif\tsheep\twill\tbe\theld\tin\tthe\tyards,\t water points and sprinklers for settling dust and a water source for dipping or jetting •\taccess\tfor\tdogs Sheep sometimes crowd together in a pen and may become smothered (especially in a corner) or push on top of others, causing injury. Allow adequate space in yards (1m2 per three adult sheep in forcing areas and 1m2 per adult sheep in holding areas). Design pens to avoid sharp corners. Check pens regularly and unblock if crowded. Ensure small lambs are not crushed by other sheep. Facilities Equipment used to muster, yard and handle sheep includes a set of well-designed sheep yards, and temporary yards for lamb marking. Seek advice from state government departments or farm advisers when designing sheep yards.

Dogs should be trained not to bite, bark excessively or chase sheep. Using poorly trained dogs can be highly stressful for sheep. Muzzle dogs that bite. 7A producer’s guide to sheep husbandry practices Restraining sheep •\tWhen\tsheep\tneed\tto\tbe\trestrained\tfor\tshort\t procedures, such as reading ear tags, mouthing or assessing body condition, use the catch-and-restrain method (see Figure 1). •\tFor\tprocedures\twhere\tsheep\tneed\tto\tbe\tsat\tup\ton\ttheir\t tail, such as foot inspecting or trimming, use the catch-and-turn method (see Figures 2–6). •\tUse\tsheep\thandlers\t(immobilisation\tequipment)\tto\t increase efficiency and operator safety when working with large numbers of sheep.

Identification determines ownership and facilitates management of sheep. Under national legislation, NLIS ear tags must be applied to sheep before they leave their property of birth. This allows sheep to be tracked for the purpose of disease control and to maintain international market access. NLIS ear tags are also useful for data management purposes in the flock. Each state of Australia has laws that require sheep to be identified. Contact your state department of agriculture or primary industries for details. It is best practice to identify individual animals or mobs when carrying out management practices such as breeding, selection, feeding and treatment of pests and diseases.

Identifying sheep Sheep treated with chemicals or veterinary medicines must be identified to demonstrate compliance with withholding periods, export slaughter intervals or wool handling intervals. Stud or breeding sheep should be individually identified to allow assessment and selection. For shows, sheep need to be identified to comply with the rules of competitions. Sheep can be identified at any age, although best practice is to earmark at lamb marking. Equipment Equipment used to identify sheep includes: •\ta\tcradle\tto\trestrain\tlambs\tduring\tlamb\tmarking,\tor\ta\t race, VE sheep handler or small pen for adult sheep at any time •\tbuckets\tfor\thandwashing\tand\tdisinfecting\tinstruments •\tdisinfectant\tfor\tinstruments,\tproperly\tdiluted •\tantiseptic\tfor\thands,\tproperly\tdiluted •\tear\ttags,\tchosen\tfor\ttheir\tpurpose\tand\tpreferred\tfeatures •\tapplicator\tappropriate\tfor\tthe\tear\ttags\t •\tearmarking\tpliers •\tspray\tcan\tof\tstock\tmarker,\ta\tregistered\tscourable\t marker in required colour •\traddle Out-dated methods of identification •\tSome\tolder\tmethods\tof\tidentification,\tsuch\tas\t tattoos and horn branding are no longer considered best practice and should not be used. •\tThese\tmethods\thave\tlargely\tbeen\treplaced\tby\t newer, more useful methods of identifying sheep. •\tTattoos\tand\thorn\tbrands\thave\tworkplace\thealth\tand\t safety disadvantages, as well as the potential to cause unnecessary pain or injury to the animal. •\tNeither\tof\tthese\tmethods\tis\trequired\tby\tlaw\tnor\t breed societies. 12 A producer’s guide to sheep husbandry practices Preventing infection when ear tagging •\tInsert\tclean\tear\ttags\tinto\tclean\tdry\tears.\t •\tIf\ttags\tare\tdirty,\twash,\tsoak\tin\tdisinfectant\tand\tdry\t before use. •\tPlace\tear\ttag\tapplicators\tin\ta\tdisinfectant\tsolution\t at least once per round of cradles, and preferably between lambs if there is any likelihood of disease transmission. •\tVaccinate\tsheep\tagainst\tclostridial\tdiseases\tand\t cheesy gland. Ear tags Sheep have sensitive ears. The type of ear tags used should have minimal effect on the animal and be clearly visible, without causing infection or bleeding, tearing the ear, creating a shearing hazard or cutting into the ear as it grows. Metal ear tags are no longer considered best practice because they have workplace health and safety disadvantages and are associated with a high level of damage to the ear. Flexible, plastic, self-piercing two-piece ear tags with male-female locks are the preferred ear tags for sheep, either with or without an electronic chip. These ear tags cause the least damage to the ear and are easy to place and read from a distance. With self-piercing ear tags, there is a low risk of disease transfer between animals. Plastic, one-piece, loop ear tags are associated with a higher level of damage to the ear than flexible, plastic, two-piece tags. If plastic, one-piece, loop ear tags are used, care must be taken to ensure the tag is placed correctly so it is neither too loose nor too tight.

In some states a register of property earmarks is kept. Check with your state department of agriculture or primary industries about the requirement for earmarks, and the location and type to be used. Problems with earmarks include pain at the time of application, bleeding, tearing of the ear and potential for disease spread. Earmarking pliers should be well maintained and sharpened frequently so they cut cleanly in a single closing. Check the pliers several weeks before use by making a test cut on a piece of thin cardboard. If the cut is not clean, replace or get pliers serviced. Keep spare pliers in case one set goes blunt. Earmarking pliers should be placed in a disinfectant solution at least once per round of cradles, and preferably between lambs if there is any likelihood of disease transmission. Earmarks are not recommended unless required by state legislation.

In sheep, incisor teeth are present in the bottom jaw, but not the upper jaw. Sheep have a hard fibrous pad on the upper jaw, instead of incisors. Adult sheep have eight incisor teeth located at the front of the lower jaw, which are used for grazing close to the ground. Temporary incisor teeth present for the first 12 months of life are gradually replaced with permanent teeth by 28–48 months of age. Molar teeth in the upper and lower jaws, toward the back of the mouth, are used for chewing. Sheep are mouthed to: •\testablish\tage •\tdetermine\tthe\tcondition\tof\tteeth\tand\tthe\tmouth •\tmeet\tmarket\tspecifications\t(eg\tlambs\tmust\thave\t temporary incisors only, hoggets must have two permanent incisors only) The teeth of sheep can be checked at any time, whenever they are in the yards for other reasons. When mouthing sheep, check for uneven or excessive wear of the teeth or loss of teeth. Sheep with greatly worn teeth or lost teeth should be culled because these animals will lose body condition. Teeth trimming or grinding Teeth trimming and grinding are methods of changing the length of the incisor teeth in sheep by mechanical means. A production benefit from teeth trimming or grinding has not been demonstrated in Australian or international field trials and these procedures are unacceptable. Equipment No special equipment is needed to mouth sheep. When first learning to mouth sheep, it is recommended to have on-hand a copy of the tooth pattern standards in this manual (see opposite). 15A producer’s guide to sheep husbandry practices Four tooth: four adult teeth, 18–24 months of age. Teeth of a lamb: birth to 12 months of age. Two tooth (hogget): two adult teeth, 12–19 months of age. Six tooth: six adult teeth, 23–36 months of age. Eight tooth (full mouth): eight adult teeth, 28–48 months of age. No more teeth to erupt. Worn adult mouth. Tooth pattern standards 16 A producer’s guide to sheep husbandry practices Broken mouth: old sheep. Gummy mouth. 17A producer’s guide to sheep husbandry practices an untreated control group. This procedure is called a Worm Egg Count Reduction Test (WECRT). Regular use of WECs to monitor sheep parasites may reduce the need for drenching and help slow the onset of drench resistance.

Collecting faecal samples for worm egg counts Faecal samples are small samples of sheep dung collected to conduct WECs and larval differentiation of worms. Samples can be taken from sheep at any time to determine their parasite burden. In particular, faecal samples can be used to decide if drenching is required or to determine the seasonal pattern of worms. Many stud breeders take samples so the WEC can be included in a ram or ewe’s ASBV. This gives an indication of the animal’s genetic merit in reducing WECs in their progeny. Comparing ASBVs between sheep enables selection of sheep for better resistance to worms. Taking samples after use of an anthelmintic (drench, capsule or injection) to check that worm egg counts are low or zero is called a ‘post-drench check’. This indicates whether the drench has been effective. To properly check the efficacy of a drench, faecal samples are taken 10–14 days after treatment and WECs are compared with either pre-drenching levels or against Reasons for performing a WEC WEC is done to: •\tmonitor\tparasite\tburdens •\tdecide\tif\tparasites\tare\tthe\tcause\tof\tscouring,\tpoor\t health or ill-thrift •\tassess\tthe\tgenetic\tmerit\tof\tan\tanimal •\ttest\tdrenches\tand\tdetermine\tthe\tmost\teffective\t drenches for different species of worms Equipment The equipment required to collect samples for a worm egg count includes: •\tdisposable\tgloves •\tsealable,\tairtight\tcontainers\t(eg\tcollection\tbottles,\t ziplock bags, sample trays) •\tpackaging\tand\tpostal\tenvelope\tto\tmail\tsamples\tto\t the laboratory Recommended method Collecting samples for routine monitoring •\tFor\troutine\tmonitoring,\tcollect\tsamples\tfrom\tthe\t ground.

Drenching for worms Worms can reduce animal growth rates and wool growth, and cause weakness, scours, poor reproductive performance or death. Many worm treatments are not effective due to resistant parasites. To check if a drench is effective, contact a veterinarian or animal health adviser to conduct a drench test. A veterinarian or animal health adviser can also plan a strategic drench program to reduce the risk of losses due to worms. The WormBoss website (wormboss.com.au) provides information on worms, drenches and animal health advisers.

Drenching sheep Drenching refers to administration of a liquid formulation to sheep by mouth, using a drench gun or other dispensing equipment. Drenching is a convenient way to treat a large number of sheep in a short time, and is well tolerated by sheep. Incorrect drenching can lead to spillage, injury, toxicity or death of the animal. Sheep can be drenched with anthelmintics (wormers), vitamin or mineral supplements and other medicines, particularly for metabolic diseases such as pregnancy toxaemia. 20 A producer’s guide to sheep husbandry practices Drench gun care and servicing Before use •\tDo\ta\tpressure\ttest\tto\tcheck\tseal\tand\tvalve\tintegrity\tby\t placing a finger over the end of the barrel and squeezing the trigger. The plunger should not depress; if it does, there is leakage or backflow. Check the piston seal and inlet and outflow valves. •\tRun\ta\tfinger\taround\tthe\tlength\tof\tthe\tbarrel\tto\tcheck\tfor\t any rough edges that could cut the sheep’s mouth. After use •\tRemove\tplastic\ttubing\tfrom\tthe\tbackpack\tand\tdrain\t remaining drench back into the container. •\tUse\t1\tlitre\tof\tclean\twarm\twater\twith\ta\tfew\tdrops\tof\t household detergent added. •\tSquirt\twater\tthrough\tthe\tgun\twith\tdose\tset\tto\tmaximum\t until clean. Carefully wash the outside of the barrel and handpiece with warm water and detergent. •\tRinse\tthoroughly\tby\tpumping\tclean\twater\tthrough\tthe\t gun. Seals may be damaged if the gun is not rinsed completely. •\tRemove\tfrom\twater,\tpump\tdry\tand\tremove\ttubing.\t •\tLubricate\tby\tdropping\ta\tsmall\tamount\tof\tapproved\toil\t (eg vegetable oil) into the cylinder and pumping the trigger a few times to disperse it into the seals. Do not use mineral oil. Products •\tStore\tdrench\tproducts\taccording\tto\tlabel\tdirections,\t and strictly adhere to directions for use. Note and act on all label precautions. •\tRecord\tthe\tbatch\tnumber\tand\texpiry\tdate,\tand\tcheck\t withholding periods and export slaughter intervals to ensure the product is suitable, particularly for sheep being sold for slaughter. •\tFollow\tthe\tlabel\tdirections\tfor\tshaking/mixing\tproducts\t prior to use. •\tIf\tnecessary,\tdispense\tthe\tcorrect\tamount\tinto\ta\t backpack, using a clean funnel. Precautions before drenching •\tFollow\tall\tlabel\tinstructions,\tespecially\twhere\tmixing\t is required. •\t‘Contraindications’\ton\tthe\tlabel\tmean\tthat\tthe\t product should not be given to specified classes of sheep. •\tPast\tadvice\tto\thold\tsheep\toff\tfeed\tand\twater\tbefore\t drenching is no longer recommended. •\tWeigh\ta\tproportion\tof\tthe\tmob\t(eg\t10\tlarge\tand\t10\t small sheep) to check the weight for adjusting the drench dosage. If there is a range of bodyweights, draft into ‘heavies’ and ‘lights’ to treat separately. Drench guns Set the drench gun at the correct dosage for the weight of sheep being drenched. Check the dosage by squirting ten doses into a measuring cylinder and reading the volume. Repeat the calibration after every 200 sheep. When finished, calculate the total amount that should have been used and check against the amount of drench remaining. Power drench guns should be set up and compressed gas or air hoses attached as per manufacturer’s instructions. Spare drench guns, as well as seals and springs, should be kept handy in case the gun needs servicing. Calibrating the drench gun before use. 21A producer’s guide to sheep husbandry practices Recommended method Administering large volume drenches, for example to treat pregnancy toxaemia Some preparations given to sheep for metabolic diseases, such as pregnancy toxaemia, need to be given in large volumes (50–160ml). Large volume drenches can be given in multiple small doses via a drench gun, or by a single dose in a large dispenser. The method is similar to that for small volume drenches (opposite), but sheep may need more time to swallow, as they are often weak at the time of treatment. Check that the sheep is swallowing by stopping briefly after each 10ml is dispensed. The emphasis should be on safely and effectively dispensing the product, not speed. When drenching, keep one hand under the sheep’s chin to hold its head level (NJ Phillips Pty Limited). •\tDo not use force on the plunger when drenching sheep. •\tIf\tforce\tis\trequired,\tit\tusually\tmeans\tthe\tbarrel\tis\t pushed against the lining of the pharynx, where it could cause bruising or injury if forced. •\tWithdraw\tand\tre-position\tthe\tbarrel\tof\tthe\tdrench\t gun and gently depress the trigger. Drenching is a convenient way to treat a large number of sheep in a short time, and is well tolerated by sheep (MSD Animal Health). Lambs should not be drenched in the lamb- marking cradle because of the risk of aspiration (drench going down the wrong way) causing pneumonia or toxicity. Administering small volume drenches, for example wormers •\tDrenching\tcan\tbe\tdone\tfrom\twithin\tthe\trace,\tholding\t each sheep firmly with the knees, or from the side of the race if the sheep are packed tightly. In a race, start at the back and work forward (optional). •\tKeep\tthe\tsheep’s\thead\tlevel\t(horizontal)\tby\tholding\tone\t hand under its chin. •\tGently\tinsert\tthe\tbarrel\tof\tthe\tdrench\tgun\tinto\tthe\tside\t of the sheep’s mouth, between the front teeth and the molars. Twist the gun slightly as it is inserted to help entry. •\tSlide\tthe\tbarrel\tgently\tbackwards\tover\tthe\ttongue\tuntil\t the tip rests on the back of the tongue. •\tPress\tthe\tplunger\tslowly\tand\tsteadily\tto\tdeliver\tthe\tfull\t dose of drench. •\tKeep\tone\thand\tunder\tthe\tsheep’s\tchin\tfor\ta\tmoment\t to prevent the sheep from immediately spitting out the drench. •\tFeel\tor\tlisten\tfor\tthe\tsheep\tto\tgrind\tits\tteeth\tas\ta\tsign\t that it has swallowed the drench. 22 A producer’s guide to sheep husbandry practices Aftercare Observe sheep before and after they are let out of the race, to check for abnormal signs of coughing or spluttering, convulsions, tremors, unsteadiness or stiff gait. Toxicity is more likely with drenches containing organophosphates or levamisole, or in lambs treated with abamectin. If toxicity is suspected, contact a veterinarian and treat as directed. Sheep spitting out drench is a sign that the drenching technique was incorrect. Start again, ensuring that the sheep’s head is level (horizontal) and that the tip of the barrel is placed over the sheep’s tongue. 23A producer’s guide to sheep husbandry practices Mineral supplementation Mineral capsules and pellets should be given as part of a strategic nutritional or management plan, after completing appropriate diagnostic tests. Supplementing with cobalt, copper or selenium without prior knowledge of the flock’s mineral status can poison sheep. Do not use copper supplements in sheep suffering from liver diseases, such as liver fluke or plant poisoning, or in sheep that are receiving other sources of copper, such as in-feed supplements or injections. Some anthelmintic capsules also contain mineral supplements. If in doubt, consult a veterinarian and have blood or liver samples checked for supplementation requirements. Take care not to use multiple products containing mineral supplements eg selenium injections and drenching with a product containing selenium can poison sheep. Equipment The equipment required to deliver capsules, pellets and boluses includes: •\tspecial\tapplicators\t–\tcheck\twith\tthe\tsupplier\tto\tensure\t you have the correct applicator •\ta\trace\tor\tsmall\tyard\t–\tsheep\tshould\tstand\twhile\t being treated. Take care to select the correct size of product for the class of sheep being treated. For example, the standard identification bolus can only be given to sheep over 12kg, but smaller sizes are available for lambs down to 8kg. Anthelmintic capsules come in sizes for large sheep (40–80kg) or small or young sheep (20–40kg). Key points •\t Check\tthe\tmineral\tstatus\tof\tsheep\tbefore\t supplementation\tto\tensure\tcorrect\tdosage\tand\t type\tof\tmineral\tused. •\t Use\tthe\tcorrect\tapplicator\tfor\teach\ttype\tof\t capsule,\tpellet\tor\tbolus. •\t Hold\tthe\tsheep’s\thead\tup\twhen\tadministering\t capsules,\tpellets\tor\tboluses.\t •\t Do\tnot\tforce\tthe\tapplicator\tor\tplunger,\tas\tthis\tcan\t result\tin\tinjury\tto\tthe\tsheep\tor\tincorrect\t administration. 6.

These include: •\tcontrolled-release\tcapsules\t(eg\tfor\tanthelmintics\tor\t other medications) •\tsolid\tmineral\tsupplements\t(eg\tselenium\tor\tcobalt\t pellets) •\tcapsules\tthat\trelease\tafter\tbreakdown\tin\tthe\tstomach\t (eg copper capsules) •\telectronic\tidentification\tboluses Capsules, pellets and boluses are given to sheep using an applicator inserted into the mouth. They remain in the rumen and dispense medication over a prolonged period, from 100 days (for drenches) up to 3–5 years (for cobalt or selenium pellets). Identification boluses remain active during the life of the animal. Check withholding periods and export slaughter intervals before giving capsules or pellets to sheep. 24 A producer’s guide to sheep husbandry practices Correct positioning of the applicator when administering pellets to sheep (Diagram courtesy of MSD Animal Health).

Flies and lice cause serious animal welfare problems, as well as economic losses for sheep producers. Integrated pest management should be used to ensure that lice and fly problems are managed appropriately, in a way that does not lead to chemical resistance. Use the LiceBoss decision tools to decide on the best time and choice of treatment for lice in sheep (www. liceboss.com.au).

Sheep should be dipped for lice 2–6 weeks after shearing to allow time for shearing cuts to heal. Dipping after 6 weeks may not be fully effective, as the dip wash cannot penetrate through fleece down to the skin. For the best results, dip sheep that are clean shorn with no remaining tufts of wool and that do not have lumpy wool (dermatophilosis) or other skin problems. For fly control, sheep should be dipped 4–6 weeks off-shears to allow sufficient wool growth to retain the chemical. Dipping must result in the thorough wetting of sheep so the chemical can penetrate to the skin. It can be slow hard work and requires the re-mustering of sheep after shearing. A well-maintained dip must be available, as well as a source of water. Other disadvantages of dipping are that operators must work with chemical concentrates when making up the dip wash, the potential for splashing from the dip wash, the need for disposal of unused dip wash at the end of each day and the risk of spreading diseases such as lumpy wool through the dip wash. However, if done properly, plunge dipping is very effective and eradication of lice is possible. Plunge dips Plunge dips can be fixed or mobile, swim-type or cage-type. Swim-type dips can be straight line or curved. Both require a 9 metre swim length with the head of the sheep dunked twice to be fully effective. Chemical left over at the end of the day needs to be disposed of in a soil-bunded area of a well-grassed paddock on deep soil that is not accessible to sheep. A cage dip decreases the chance of exposing operators to dip chemical, but it is an expensive machine that requires an external power supply, such as a tractor. Cage dips are efficient and can dip several thousand sheep a day safely and effectively. Cage dipping is often conducted by contractors that are usually highly trained and experienced.

Shower dips Shower dips can effectively saturate sheep with insecticide if they are modified according to strict guidelines and operated for 12–15 minutes. Extensive research has shown that if the shower dip is run for less than 12–15 minutes, the sheep are rarely treated sufficiently for the skin to be saturated. Due to the slow throughput and increased risk of exposing operators to spray drift, shower dips are not recommended as best practice.

Wear appropriate personal protective equipment when handling chemical concentrates (MSD Animal Health). 30 A producer’s guide to sheep husbandry practices Using a fire hose to wet sheep is not acceptable. It is not an adequate substitute for jetting because it does not allow fluid to thoroughly wet the skin of all sheep. Using a fire hose will result in excess residues on some sheep and insufficient protection on others. Chemical manufacturers do not support the use of fire hoses to apply chemical to sheep.

Jetting Jetting is an effective way of applying insecticide for control of lice or flystrike in long wool. Sheep can be jetted for lice at any time from six weeks after shearing, if product label directions allow. Jetting to protect against flystrike should be done at least six weeks after shearing, based on the risk of strike, and taking account of weather and sheep factors. Jetting is a slow physical job that cannot be rushed. Operators need to wear appropriate protective equipment, maintain thorough application technique and avoid working when fatigued. Other disadvantages of jetting include operators working with chemical concentrates and the disposal of unused jetting fluid at the end of the day. 31A producer’s guide to sheep husbandry practices fluid is dripping from the belly. Jetting wash will drip from the belly several minutes after application. •\tSheep\tcan\talso\tbe\tchecked\tfor\tsaturation\tto\tthe\tskin\tby\t using an indelible pencil to test for wetness in a few key spots (eg in the folds of skin behind the neck and on the brisket).

Treating with backline products Pour-on backline and spray-on products are a fast and easy way to apply chemical to sheep for lice and fly control. These products require low capital costs, are labour- efficient and do not expose workers to as much spray as other methods of chemical application. An additional benefit is that a source of water is not required because the products come in ready-to-use formulations that can be applied without dilution. Compared to saturation methods, pour-on backline and spray-on treatments are less stressful to sheep and reduce the risk of post-dipping lameness, cheesy gland and other infections. Products are available for long and short wool and for lice or fly control. Backliners for lice work best on sheep that are clean-shorn, without any tufts or wool, scabs, crusting or lumpy wool. Treatment of sheep in long wool for lice will not result in eradication, and sheep will need to be re-treated after shearing with an appropriate off-shears or short wool product. When treating large numbers of sheep, operator fatigue must not compromise application technique. Equipment Equipment to treat sheep with pour-on or spray-on backline products includes: •\tchemical\tand\tcorrect\tapplicator •\tappropriate\ttubing\tand\tgas\tcanisters\t(for\tpowered\t application) •\tpersonal\tprotective\tequipment\tas\tspecified\ton\tthe\t product label 33A producer’s guide to sheep husbandry practices Application pattern •\tCheck\tthe\tlabel\tcarefully\tto\tensure\tthe\tcorrect\tvolume\t is applied using the correct application pattern.

Sheep usually receive injected drugs subcutaneously (under the skin), but some injections may be given intramuscularly (into the muscle). Care should be taken to ensure injections are administered in the correct place, do not harm the animal or the operator, and do not cause adverse reactions or abscesses. Read the label or seek advice from a veterinarian or animal health adviser to plan the best time for vaccination. Sheep are sometimes treated for metabolic conditions, such as pregnancy toxaemia, with large volume subcutaneous injections (70–100ml).

The skin on this part of the neck is loose and this improves the ease of subcutaneous injection and helps to minimise carcase damage when swelling occurs. It is also less likely to be dirty, reducing the risk of contamination. One-handed techniques using a self-tenting vaccinating gun are encouraged when giving oil-based vaccines, such as the ovine Johne’s disease vaccine. However, it is very important that vaccines and other products labelled for subcutaneous use are not accidentally given intramuscularly. To give a subcutaneous injection: •\tpick\tup\tthe\tskin\tbetween\tthe\tthumb\tand\tforefinger\tof\t one hand and deliver the injection with the other, with the needle parallel to the animal’s body •\tdo not push the needle through the skin tent and out the other side, or too deep (into the muscle) •\tpush\tthe\tplunger\tto\tdeliver\tthe\tdose If pressure is felt during the injection, do not keep pressing the plunger. This may indicate that the needle is resting in the muscle. Reposition the needle and try again. •\tNeedles\tthat\tare\tblunt,\tbent\tor\tare\tdropped\tshould\tbe\t changed immediately.

Use the catch-and-restrain method or catch-and-turn method to restrain sheep that are not being injected in a race or sheep-handling device. Giving subcutaneous injections Subcutaneous injections should be given high on the neck, behind the ear. The product being injected is delivered into a pocket under the skin, above the muscle layer. Many injections result in small lumps in the skin or muscle of the animal. Injection high on the neck, behind the ear, allows for easy trimming of the carcase at Giving a low-volume subcutaneous injection high on the neck, behind the ear (Photo courtesy of NJ Phillips Pty Limited). 36 A producer’s guide to sheep husbandry practices Operator safety when injecting All injections have the potential to cause injury to operators.

Vaccines Vaccines help protect against common diseases, such as blackleg, tetanus, pulpy kidney, cheesy gland, scabby mouth and arthritis in lambs caused by Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae. A few vaccines are single-dose treatments (eg ovine Johne’s disease vaccine and scabby mouth), and a single vaccination will usually be sufficient for lifetime protection, but most vaccines require a booster to provide full immunity. Ensure sheep complete the vaccination program for each type of vaccine or they may suffer sickness, death or production losses. 38 A producer’s guide to sheep husbandry practices Trimming the horns of adult rams may result in excessive bleeding and distress to the animal, and should only be done under veterinary supervision with appropriate pain relief.

Horn trimming Horn trimming is the removal of the hard tip of rams’ horns. If done correctly, this should not cause distress or injury to the ram, as the cut area does not contain nerves or blood vessels. Rams’ horns may need to be trimmed to prevent ingrown horns damaging the face and eyes, to prevent injury to other rams and handlers, to help prevent flystrike, to make rams easier to load and transport, and to stop rams catching their horns in fences, yards or trees. Horns are best trimmed at hogget age (before 12 months of age). Trim the horn half way around the first curl, midway between the ear and the eye, with the direction of cut perpendicular to the ground and parallel with the serrations on the horn. Trimming at hogget age and in this way reduces the risk of the horns growing into the ram’s face. When trimming rams’ horns, the cut surface should not bleed. Polled rams Polled rams are available in many breeds of sheep. Without horns, these rams are less prone to injure themselves and other sheep, giving them distinct advantages for animal welfare and carcase quality. Equipment Equipment for horn trimming includes: •\thydraulic\tshears •\tlong-handled\tcutters •\thorn-cutting\twire\tsaws\twith\thandles 39A producer’s guide to sheep husbandry practices Choice of de-horning method Hydraulic shears are the quickest method of de- horning, and cause minimal risk of injury and little operator fatigue. However, they are more expensive than other equipment. Long-handled cutters are also fast and effective, but may contribute to operator fatigue if many rams are being trimmed. Using wire saws with handles is a slow and physical method of de-horning, which can injure rams and operators and cause operator fatigue. They are only practical for small numbers of rams, and should only be used when the other options are not available. Power tools are not acceptable due to the high risk of injury to operators and rams.

The cut is made at an angle perpendicular to the ground, and parallel to the serrations of the horn. •\tThe\toperator\tshould\tuse\tboth\thands\tto\thold\tthe\tblades\t in position, and ensure the handler’s hands are away from blades. •\tFor\thydraulic\tshears,\tactivate\tthe\tswitch\tto\tclose\tthe\t jaws of the shears. •\tFor\tlong-handled\tcutters,\tsqueeze\tthe\tblades\ttogether\t in one smooth action. •\tFor\tdehorning\twire,\tuse\ta\tsmooth\taction\tto\tcut,\t ensuring that the handler keeps the ram’s head as still as possible throughout the process to ensure a neat cut.

Scurs Scurs are vestigial (small) horns that can occur in an animal that it was expected would be polled. Scurs are not attached to the skull and can grow into random shapes. They are rarely a concern in slaughter lambs, but may be a problem in rams. If trimming is required, consult a veterinarian. 40 A producer’s guide to sheep husbandry practices Infectious disease, such as footrot, should be diagnosed early so that a control program can be started before the disease spreads through the flock. In some regions of Australia, footrot is a notifiable disease. Prior to purchasing sheep always inspect the feet of as many of the sheep as possible and request a fully completed National Sheep Health Statement/valid footrot vendor declaration. Rams should have their feet inspected at least eight weeks before the start of joining. Pare to a normal shape if required and treat any other foot problems. Inspect the feet of all other sheep annually or if the animal is showing signs of lameness. Avoid inspecting the feet of ewes in the 4–6 weeks leading up to the start of lambing; after this time, foot treatment may cause stress and lambing losses. It may be unnecessary to turn over ewes for inspection at this time, but any cases of lameness should be inspected to determine the cause and treat appropriately.

Inspecting and paring feet Foot health is essential to the wellbeing of sheep. Lameness can cause major losses in productivity, largely because the sheep are unable to walk to find adequate food and water. Lameness can lead to malnutrition, ill-thrift, reduced wool growth, flystrike, low reproductive performance and even death. Conditions such as wet weather, muddy conditions, certain feeds, grass seeds, infections, poor conformation and certain ‘soft’ geological soil types can result in the hoof wearing unevenly, overgrowing or breaking down. It’s important to know normal foot anatomy, how to examine sheep for lameness and how to pare feet. Veterinarians may need to be engaged to diagnose and treat foot disease, and livestock contractors can pare feet. Signs of lameness in sheep Sore or diseased feet can result in lameness. Signs of lameness can be obvious or very subtle.

Footbaths Footbaths are commonly used to toughen soft feet and to treat infectious causes of lameness. Trimmed feet can more readily absorb chemicals, such as zinc sulphate that is used to toughen the feet, enabling them to better withstand wet conditions. Because of workplace health and safety concerns and the availability of effective alternatives, formalin is no longer recommended for foot bathing. 43A producer’s guide to sheep husbandry practices operator. This should be possible in most sheep production systems in Australia that have a 5–6-week joining interval and that mark lambs two weeks after the end of lambing. Castrating lambs older than 12 weeks of age is not considered best practice. If the lambs are older than 12 weeks, castration may coincide with the onset of puberty, increasing the risk of complications. Use appropriate pain relief products for the procedure being undertaken if practical, cost-effective pain relief products are registered and available for use in sheep. Consult your veterinarian for information on pain relief products for use in sheep. Traditionally, sheep have been castrated using lamb- marking rings or a lamb-marking knife. Of these two methods, lamb-marking rings are preferred, and are used by\tapproximately\t90%\tof\tAustralian\tsheep\tproducers\tto\t castrate lambs.

Castrating Consider engaging an accredited livestock contractor to mark lambs. Accredited livestock contractors are trained and experienced in various lamb-marking procedures, including castration. Lambs for speciality markets that will be slaughtered before 12 weeks of age should not be castrated. Lambs that will be slaughtered before the onset of puberty (at around 3–6 months of age) may also not require castration. Lambs should be castrated at 2–8 weeks of age, when they have smaller testicles and scrotums. This means that the lambs have less sensitive tissue to be removed, resulting in smaller wounds and faster healing. Younger lambs are easier and safer to handle, meaning castration can be done faster and with less stress for lamb and It is essential that ewes are given a booster dose of tetanus or clostridial disease vaccine 2–4 weeks before the start of lambing. This gives lambs disease protection via the colostrum (first milk).

The lamb-marking rings do not remove the woolly skin on the tip of the tail and there is a risk of tetanus if the ewes and lambs are not properly vaccinated. The tails of sheep should only be docked when there is no alternative to improve the lifetime welfare benefit to sheep and flock management. Tail docking should not be done for cosmetic reasons. Wool-shedding breeds and short-tailed breeds (eg Wiltshire Horn, Dorper) do not require tail docking. Lambs should be tail docked at 2–8 weeks of age. Younger lambs have smaller tails; that means less sensitive tissue to be removed, resulting in smaller wounds and faster healing. Younger lambs are easier and safer to handle, meaning docking can be done faster and with less stress for lamb and operator. This should be possible in most sheep production systems in Australia that have a 5–6-week joining period with lamb marking two weeks after the end of lambing. If docking is delayed until after lambs are eight weeks of age, healing is slower and the risk of infection will increase. The best method of docking lambs is to use a gas-heated tail-docking knife, preferably designed to remove the woolly skin on the tip of the tail.

The lamb-marking knife is not a best practice method for tail docking lambs and is not recommended. Using mulesing shears to tail dock lambs is an unacceptable practice for the humane care of livestock. Use appropriate pain relief products for the procedure being undertaken, if practical, cost-effective pain relief products are registered and available for use in sheep. Consult your veterinarian for information on pain relief products for use in sheep. Equipment Equipment to tail dock lambs includes: •\tgas-heated\ttail-docking\tknife,\tfull\tgas\tbottle(s),\t connecting hoses, wire brush to clean the cutting edge of the knife, iron stand and shroud for holding the knife •\tbuckets\tfor\thandwashing\tand\tdisinfecting •\tantiseptic Recommended method The information on lamb marking in Chapter 1 (on pages 9–10) should be read in conjunction with this section.

In addition, short tails: o take longer to heal o are more likely to become infected during healing, increasing the risk of arthritis o increase the lifetime risk of flystrike o increase the risk of rectal prolapse o predispose sheep to a higher risk of vulval and anal cancers Lamb-marking knives and mulesing shears create a higher risk of bleeding and of transferring blood and spreading diseases between animals. Using mulesing shears to tail dock lambs can result in misshapen, deviated tails. Use of the lamb-marking knife is not considered best practice for tail docking lambs and using mulesing shears is unacceptable. Recommended tail length. 48 A producer’s guide to sheep husbandry practices Consider engaging an accredited livestock contractor to mark lambs. Accredited livestock contractors are trained and experienced in the various lamb-marking procedures, and most will have access to a gas- heated tail-docking knife designed to preferentially remove the woolly skin on the tip of the tail. Lambs should be given their first dose of tetanus or clostridial disease vaccine at lamb marking, and a booster dose at weaning, then annual booster vaccinations in subsequent years.

The poll shot gives the best results in sheep because the brainstem, which lies between the ears, is easily targeted and destroyed from this position. The brainstem must be destroyed for death to occur. To destroy the brainstem with a poll shot, aim at the back of the head, behind the horns, so that the bullet or bolt will pass midway between the base of the ears, which is where the brainstem lies. When using a rifle or pistol: •\thold\tthe\tend\tof\tthe\tbarrel\t10–100cm\taway\tfrom\tthe\tpoll\t to prevent misdirection and maximise impact •\tkeep\tany\tother\tpeople\tin\tattendance\t(or\tin\tthe\tnear\t vicinity) behind the firearms operator and well out of the way •\ttake\tcare\tin\tconcrete\tand\tsteel\tyards\tto\tavoid\tricochet\t of bullets Key points •\t The\tmost\tacceptable\tmethod\tof\tkilling\tsheep\t on-farm\tis\tby\tshooting\twith\ta\tfirearm\tor\t penetrating\tcaptive\tbolt\tgun\tinto\tthe\tpoll\tof\tthe\t head\tto\tdestroy\tthe\tbrainstem.\t •\t When\tshooting\tsheep,\tthe\tbrain\tis\tthe\tonly\t approved\ttarget\torgan.\t •\t After\tbeing\tshot,\ta\tsheep\tmust\tbe\timmediately\t checked\tfor\tsigns\tconsistent\twith\tdeath\tand\tagain\t at\tleast\tfive\tminutes\tlater\tin\tcase\tit\twas\tonly\tstunned. 13. Humane killing When sheep must be killed, the primary consideration is preventing the animal from suffering pain and distress. Killing should be done promptly and safely by a competent person. The method used must result in rapid loss of consciousness and death while unconscious. The person performing the kill should have the relevant, knowledge, skills or experience to undertake humane killing of an animal, or be under the direct supervision of a person who does. The minimum number of people should be present and other distractions should be minimised. To prevent unnecessary distress or alarm, the sheep should be handled calmly and restrained in a race or small pen. Equipment for humanely killing a moribund sheep includes: •\ta\tfirearm\tcapable\tof\tdelivering\tat\tleast\tthe\tpower\tof\ta\t standard 0.22-long rifle cartridge plus appropriate ammunition or, •\ta\tpenetrating\tcaptive\tbolt\tdevice,\tblank\tammunition\tor, •\t a\tsharp\tknife Regularly clean firearms and captive bolts and maintain in optimal working condition. Equipment Personnel using firearms or captive bolt guns should be appropriately trained. Firearms licences and registrations are required for rifles and pistols in all states, but not for captive bolt guns, except in Western Australia and Tasmania. 50 A producer’s guide to sheep husbandry practices Confirming death Immediately after a successful killing shot or blow, the animal collapses, contracts its muscles for 15 to 20 seconds and then relaxes and begins reflex kicking that can last for minutes, and is especially prolonged and vigorous in lambs. The muscle contractions and reflex kicking are not signs of life or pain, and observers should be informed of this. Watch the animal carefully for signs of life, which are breathing, eye movements, blinking, bleating or attempts to lift the head or stand. If there is any doubt that an animal is dead, shoot it again, as quickly as possible. (In the case of a lamb less than 24 hours of age killed by blunt trauma, hit it again as quickly as possible). Direct the shot or blow between the ears again, but from a different angle. Do not leave or dispose of the animal without confirming that it is dead. This is in case an animal seems dead, but is only stunned. Perform a ‘five-finger head check’ of the brainstem reflexes five minutes after the shot or blow to confirm the animal is dead and not stunned. A dead animal will have: 1. no blink reflex 2. fixed dilated pupils 3. a flaccid lower jaw 4. a flaccid tongue 5. no breathing Kneel safely behind the animal’s head and check off the absence of each of these five reflexes using the fingers of one hand. When using a captive bolt gun: •\tpress\tthe\tmuzzle\tfirmly\tagainst\tthe\tskull\t\t •\tuse\tblank\trounds\tof\ta\tstrength\tappropriate\tfor\tthe\tclass\t of sheep •\tonly\tuse\ta\twell\tmaintained\tpenetrating\tcaptive\tbolt\tgun\t and ammunition that has been properly stored •\tbe\tprepared\tto\tperform\ta\tsecond\tshot\tif\tthere\tis\tany\t doubt the animal has been killed (see opposite for how to confirm death) Blunt trauma to the brain is an acceptable method of killing lambs younger than 24 hours of age. Using a heavy blunt instrument such as a mash hammer, strike the poll of the head with sufficient force to cause the skull to cave-in. The blow should be directed at the brainstem, which lies between the ears. Bleeding-out of sheep without pre-stunning using the neck cut with a suitable sharp knife should only be done when there is no firearm or captive bolt reasonably available. A – Recommended position and direction of fire for the humane killing of sheep using the poll shot. B – Straight down or crown shot that should only be used in emergencies when the poll is not accessible.
