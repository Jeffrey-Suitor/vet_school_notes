Explain how the structural and functional organisation of the cells, tissues, organs and body systems enable maintenance of homeostasis 2. Communicate anatomical and microscopic features of animal tissues using scientific terminology 3. Explain how homeostasis is maintained through normal hormonal, electrical and pharmacological communication 4.Describe the major components of the immune system and the clinical manifestations of an activated immune response 5. Apply the principles of common infectious and non-infectious pathological processes to explain the clinical features of infection and disease 6. Work collaboratively, communicate effectively, and apply an understanding of cellular and organ structure and function in order to analyse and interpret clinical problems in animals Lecture 1: ILOs • Describe the relationship between cells, tissues, organs and body systems in terms of their anatomical structure and physiological functions • Describe the basic structure of a cell and understand the function of the major cell components • Explain the general concept of homeostasis and the principles of positive and negative feedback in physiological systems Cells Tissues Organs Organ Systems Organism Cells Tissues Organs Organ Systems Organism • The basic structural and functional units of life • Perform basic functions such as • obtaining nutrients and oxygen, • producing energy from nutrients • eliminating wastes, • synthesising proteins • controlling the movement of molecules into the cell • growth • Cells are differentiated to perform a wide range of specialist functions Basic Cell StructureBasic Cell Structure Cell membrane: • Thin membrane that encloses cell • Selectively controls movement of molecules between ICF and ECF Basic Cell Structure Nucleus: • Contains the cell’s DNA: control centre of the cell • DNA – protein complex is called chromatin • Nucleolus: site of ribosome assembly Basic Cell Structure Endoplasmic Reticulum: • Membranous system of fluid-filled tubules and sacs • Rough ER: ribosomes attached, synthesises proteins for secretion and membrane construction • Smooth ER: no ribosomes, carbohydrate metabolism and lipid synthesis Basic Cell Structure Golgi Apparatus: (Golgi complex, Golgi body) • Post-translational modification of proteins • Packaging of proteins and lipids – especially for export Basic Cell Structure Mitochondria: • ‘Power plants’ of the cell : generate energy for cellular functions • Site of oxidation of carbohydrates and lipids Basic Cell Structure Ribosomes: • Synthesise proteins from mRNA under the direction of nuclear DNA • Some are attached to RER, others are ‘free’ in the cytosol Basic Cell Structure Lysosomes: • Intra-cellular digestive system • Sacs containing enzymes that digest cellular macromolecules Basic Cell Structure Peroxisomes: • Sacs containing enzymes which detoxify cellular wastes Basic Cell Structure Cytoskeleton: • Intracellular scaffolding to support ad organise cellular components • Includes microtubules, microfilaments and intermediate filaments Cells Tissues Organs Organ Systems Organism • Tissues are groups of cells that carry out a similar function • There are four primary types of tissues: o Nervous tissue: cells specialised in initiating and transmitting electrical impulses o Epithelial tissue: cells specialised in the exchange of materials between the cell and environment o Connective tissue: cells and extracellular material specialised for connecting and supporting o Muscle: cells specialised for contraction Cells Tissues Organs Organ Systems Organism • Organs are two or more types of tissue organised together to perform specific functions • Example: the stomach o Lined with epithelial tissue that controls absorption and secretion o Wall contains smooth muscle tissue to contract the stomach o Wall also contains nervous tissue with controls the frequency of contraction o Tissue types are bound by connective tissue Cells Tissues Organs Body Systems Organism • Body systems are groups of organs that perform related functions • Example: the digestive system, which includes: • Mouth, salivary glands, pharynx • Oesophagus, stomach, intestines • Pancreas, liver and gallbladder Body systems • Musculoskeletal • Digestive • Cardiovascular • Respiratory • Integumentary • Immune & Lymphatic • Nervous • Urinary • Endocrine • Reproductive Your studies in Veterinary Biosciences are organised by body system • Digestive • Cardiovascular • Respiratory • Urinary • Endocrine • Integumentary • Immune & Lymphatic • Musculoskeletal • Nervous • Reproductive DVM2DVM1 Cells Tissues Organs Body Systems Organism • Body systems are packaged together to form the organism • Many complex body processes require interactions of multiple body systems A critical skill for all veterinarians is the ability to integrate their understanding of how the body systems work together across the organism to form a cohesive whole Cells to Systems Lecture 1: Introduction Video 2 Dr Laura Dooley Senior Lecturer laura.dooley@unimelb.edu.au VETS30015 / VETS90121 Lecture 1: ILOs • Describe the relationship between cells, tissues, organs and body systems in terms of their anatomical structure and physiological functions • Describe the basic structure of a cell and understand the function of the major cell components • Explain the general concept of homeostasis and the principles of positive and negative feedback in physiological systems Homeostasis Homeostasis is the ability of physiological systems to maintain conditions within the body in a relatively constant state of equilibrium • Dynamic process – internal environment is constantly adjusting • For example: pH, oxygen levels, temperature, fluid volumes, cell numbers • Body systems work together in an integrated way to maintain homeostasis • Failure of homeostasis can lead to disease Homeotherms utilise a range of physiological and behavioural mechanisms to maintain their body temperature within a very narrow range Dog 37.9 - 39.9 ºC Cattle (dairy) 38.0 - 39.3 ºC Horse 37.0 - 38.3 ºC Sheep 38.5 - 39.9 ºCCat 38.1 - 39.2 ºC Homeostasis Homeostasis is the ability of physiological systems to maintain conditions within the body in a relatively constant state of equilibrium • Dynamic process – internal environment is constantly adjusting • For example: pH, oxygen levels, temperature, fluid volumes, cell numbers • Body systems work together in an integrated way to maintain homeostasis • Failure of homeostasis can lead to disease Interdependent relationship between cells, body systems and homeostasis Body Systems HomeostasisCells Maintain Is essential for the survival of Make up HomeostasisExample: thermoregulation Thermoreceptor sensory fibres located in the skin, skeletal muscles, hypothalamus Efferent autonomic pathways Vasodilation, Panting Hypothalamus thermoregulatory centre Feedback mechanisms • Homeostasis requires communication – lots of it!  Feedback is a critical part of this communication • Negative feedback loops counteract changes that of parameters that have varied from their set points  Contributes to maintenance of a relatively steady state (homeostasis!)  Disruptions to negative feedback disrupt homeostasis, which can lead to disease • In contrast, positive feedback amplifies the initial change, which moves the parameter further from its steady state  Positive feedback is not as common Negative feedback Example: Regulation of thyroid hormonesPositive feedback example: birth Provides rapid amplification, and works well where there is a mechanism to break the feedback loop Lecture 1: ILOs • Describe the relationship between cells, tissues, organs and body systems in terms of their anatomical structure and physiological functions • Describe the basic structure of a cell and understand the function of the major cell components • Explain the general concept of homeostasis and the principles of positive
