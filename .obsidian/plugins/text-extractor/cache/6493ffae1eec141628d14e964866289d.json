We see woolly sheep about 4,000 years later • The mouflon was very suitable for domestication: a relative lack of aggression, a compact size, early sexual maturity, a social nature, high reproduction rates • Studies comparing European and Asian breeds of sheep showed clear genetic differences between the two Sheep breeds • There are a large number of sheep breeds bred in different environments and for different purposes. • In Australia the majority of sheep are Merino (for wool) and Merino crosses (dual purpose wool/meat). Sheep breeds specifically for meat are becoming more popular (e.g. Poll Dorset, Dorper). Sheep are also used to produce milk (e.g. East Friesian sheep). • While breed, and genetics in general, has an effect on behaviour, life experience has a major influence. Group behaviour • Sheep are gregarious, but there are breed differences (e.g. Merinos, herding) • They tend to rest closely together (and in times of danger) but disperse more during grazing • Social facilitation of behaviour Flock behaviour • Live in flocks • Complex social hierarchy, particularly obvious when competing for limited resources (e.g. water trough, supplemental feed) • Use of home ranges with specific bedding grounds • Natural grazing behaviour can include 8-16 km/day, depending on water source and feed availability • Preferred grazing times are early morning and late afternoon Social hierarchy • Complex social hierarchy, but little aggression • Oldest ewe often most dominant, pushing, rather than fighting • Stomping leg can be threat, lowered head and head shake sign of submission • May lower head and rush at subordinates • Vocalisations used mainly for social re-instatement • Goats are more aggressive than sheep, use their horns • Goats rear heads when rushing at opponent • When sheep and goats are mixed and fight, sheep often win Handling of sheep • Isolation is highly stressful to sheep • Use of dogs causes stress • Move sheep in groups with gentle movement • Food can be used to entice them • Use confinement facilities • Drafting gates can be used draft off selected sheep Videos • Flight zone • https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zNKbfaCxbU&list=PL4OaBCdO3 4bBi3AxpqZLtIG-0qVZSnf8s&index=13 • Husbandry activities • https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6Lmmr8MMGY&list=PL4OaBCd O34bBi3AxpqZLtIG-0qVZSnf8s&index=12","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
