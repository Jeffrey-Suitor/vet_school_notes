Why is nutrition important to the veterinary profession? • Keeping domestic animals means feeding them differently to ‘in the wild’ • Feeding a ‘natural diet’ is not easy • Price; convenience; safety (cats and dogs) • Feeding for growth (production animals) • Feeding for performance (horses; racing greyhounds) • Many conditions linked to diet or feeding practices: • E.g. horses: tooth problems, colic, obesity, laminitis, equine asthma, hyperlipidaemia, ‘tying up’, Why is it needed? How is it used? • Nutrition is fundamental to animal well-being. • An understanding of animal nutrition is vital to maintaining animal health and correcting nutritional diseases. • In a world of ever-increasing competition for resources, as we use animals for food, fibre and work, nutrients must be utilised efficiently if we are to live sustainably and farms are to remain economically viable. Three major functions of foods • Energy • Provided by carbohydrates, fats, fibre (herbivores especially), [proteins] • Tissue building blocks • Provided by proteins and fats • Essential components • E.g. enzymes, hormones, vitamins Processing and use of major body metabolites in ruminants Sources of food components What’s special about foods from animals?Some species have more essential nutrients than others Module 2 – Care and Welfare of domestic animals Introduction to nutrition Part 2: Pasture, forages and concentrates Professor Simon Bailey bais@unimelb.edu.au (with acknowledgement to Dr. Ian Bland) VETS30030 / VETS90122 IVPNutritionally, what do we want from plants and pastures? • Supply of: • energy, • fibre, • protein • This can be achieved with sown pastures or natural pastures and plants An ideal pasture is: • Nutritious • Meets nutritional requirements year round • Persists under grazing and out-competes weeds • Maintains ground cover (prevents erosion) • Doesn’t cause health problems Comparing plant types: forages and concentrates Energy, fibre and protein in forages • High in fibre: • Plants’ structure derived from ‘structural carbohydrates’: cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin, lignin • Indigestible by the mammalian gastro-intestinal enzymes • BUT microbes can digest C, HC and P to obtain energy! • Herbivores use microbial function to digest plant fibre • (very few organisms can digest lignin) • Lower in energy • Variable protein Both forages and concentrates contain: energy, fibre and protein Seasonal variation in forage nutrient quality Example of seasonal variation in forage nutrition Autumn: Quality low before rainfall starts to increase Winter: high quality but low quantity Spring: High quality, abundant quantity Summer: Quality and quantity declinesquality → Energy, fibre and protein in concentrates • Higher in energy • E.g. starch – can be digested by mammalian GIT tract enzymes • Lower in fibre • Higher in peas, beans; lower in grains • Variable protein • High in peas, beans • Low in grains Typical plant feed compositions Fats Protein Fibre Carbohydrates Module 2 – Care and Welfare of domestic animals Introduction to nutrition Part 3: Feed utilisation by animals Professor Simon Bailey bais@unimelb.edu.au (with acknowledgement to Dr. Ian Bland) VETS30030 / VETS90122 IVPFeed utilisation by animalsHead adaptations: mouths and beaksBirds • Birds have no teeth and usually few jaw and tongue muscles (to save weight) • Food may be stored in the crop (part of the oesophagus) • The glandular part of the stomach is the proventriculus • Food grinding is in the muscular gizzard (ventriculus), which may contain swallowed grit or stones crop proventriculus gizzard (ventriculus) oesophagus caeca cloaca liver beak duodenum pancreas colon jejunum Gut complexity increases as diets become less based on animal-derived feeds Carnivores • High biological value foods are quickly and easily digested. A simple gut with small storage will do. • Diets of animal products are high biological value foods Omnivores • An omnivorous animal has more space for digesting and microbial fermentation. Herbivores • Herbivores ferment cellulose and other plant structural CHOs in the fore- and/or hindgut • Herbivores need large gut sections to hold enough low-density food while its digested and to house microbes to digest plant structural carbohydrates Foregut fermenters • Foregut fermenters get the benefit of microbial digestion FIRST • This is less efficient on high quality feed • But best at utilising low quality feed Sheep: • Ruminant foregut fermenters Kangaroo: • Non-ruminant foregut fermenters Hindgut fermenters • Hindgut fermenters can digest better quality feed themselves in the upper gut • Less wastage than with microbial digestion • But they can’t utilise as many microbial products as ruminants without eating their faeces (coprophagy) • Some do this (rabbits, guinea pigs) Herbivores Foregut fermenters Ruminates Chews cud to improve digestion Ruminants 3 fermentation chambers in Foregut + true stomach Grazers: most developed reticulorumen Mainly fibrous forage (grasses etc) diets e.g. cattle, sheep Browsers: relatively smaller reticulorumen Also called intermediates Prefer less fibrous diets, e.g. pasture forbs (herbs), leaves from shrubs e.g. goats Concentrate selectors: least developed reticulorumen Prefers fruits, seeds, other highly digestible plant components e.g. deer, giraffe Pseudoruminants (2+1 chambers) Doesn’t ruminate No separate forestomach compartment, e.g. kangaroo Hindgut fermenters e.g. horse, rhinoceros, elephant Monogastrics (along with omnivores and carnivores) ‘Multigastrics’ The way we classify herbivores helps us understand their dietary needs Summary • Different feed types, sources and nutritional ‘qualities’ • Pasture, forages and concentrates • Compare and contrast nutritional requirements with methods of feed utilisation","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
