KEYWORDS urine, dilute, concentrated, loop of Henle, countercurrent multiplication, countercurrent exchange, vasa recta, medullary interstitium, collecting tubule, antidiuretic hormone (ADH, vasopressin), aquaporins LECTURE 20 – STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF THE KIDNEYS 3 – DILUTION AND CONCENTRATION OF URINE AND ANTIDIURETIC HORMONE This lecture will cover how urine is diluted and concentrated by the kidneys, and the main mechanisms by which this happens – most notably the role of antidiuretic hormone (ADH, also called vasopressin), and the countercurrent multiplication/countercurrent exchange mechanism.
