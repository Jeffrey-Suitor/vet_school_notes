Duration? Response? • Any non-gastrointestinal signs? • Appetite • Changes in body condition Diet • Especially important for disorders that might involve the digestive system • Current diet • Quality (What food(s) – brand / source? Treats?) • Quantity (How much? How often?) • Provision (Competition? Indoor / outdoor? Scavenger?) • Recent changes to diet? • When? What was the former diet? • Access to other food sources in environment? (Toxins?) • Individual or herd? Vomiting or regurgitation? • Regurgitation • Passive process • Always oesophageal problem • Vomiting • Active process • Can be primary gastrointestinal problem • Can be metabolic / toxic issue • More in Lecture 12 Diarrhoea • Volume / frequency • Consistency • Appearance • Blood (fresh / melena) • Mucous • Pallor • Small or large intestine? • More in Lecture 25 Observation from a distance • Prior to approaching / handling animal – will depend on context • Demeanour & behaviour • Posture & gait • Defecation & urination • Respiratory rate • Environment • Bedding, feeding equipment, hygiene, ventilation Physical examination • Abbreviated (major body system assessment) in emergency situations (e.g. distress, collapse) • Cardiovascular, respiratory, neurological systems • Otherwise: thorough, systematic examination, including the digestive system More is missed by not looking than not knowing - Thomas McCrae (1870-1935) Physical examination • Approach will vary with animal species: • Context / environment / husbandry • Handling / restraint • Anatomy / physiology Physical examination • Body condition • Mentation & demeanour • Rectal temperature • Auscultation • Heart rate & rhythm, lung sounds, borborygmi • Hydration status • Skin turgor, mucous membrane colour & capillary refill time • Palpation • Pulses, body surface, joint / limb swelling or pain, pitting oedema • Oral examination • Dental health, foreign bodies cats, masses, ulceration, etc. Body condition • Prioritisation of differentials can vary with body condition • For example, 10-year-old cat presenting with vomiting: • Obese: Pancreatitis higher on DDx list • Thin: Infiltrative bowel disease higher on DDx list • Can revisit history to query owner observations or clarify timeframes, if necessary Body conditionOral examinationPitting oedemaPhysical examination • Abdominal auscultation (+ percussion) • Borborygmi • Rumen contractions • Ileocaecal valve flush • Abdominal palpation • Organ size and position • Foreign body • Lymph nodes • Ballottement in large animals Abdominal palpation • Cats and small dogs / puppies (can be difficult in larger dogs) • Can detect organomegaly, foreign bodies, etc. • Should be able to feel: • Both kidneys • Urinary bladder • Intestinal loops • Caudal margin of the liver • Faecal balls • Not normal to feel: • Spleen, lymph nodes Rectal examination • Small animals – digital palpation Rectal examination • Large animals Nasogastric intubationPutting it all together • You will have established: • Whether the animal is likely to have an infectious disease • Whether the animal requires treatment • Symptomatic • Specific • Treatment trial • Whether further investigation is required • Usually, localisation of the disorder, and sometimes the diagnosis Additional diagnostics • Clinical pathology – more in Lecture 30 • Haematology and serum biochemistry • Urinalysis • Faecal analysis • Abdominocentesis • Imaging – see Lecture 9 • Radiography • Ultrasound • Endoscopy – imaging / biopsy / FB retrieval • Exploratory laparotomy (+/- biopsy) Normal equine stomach Severe gastric ulcers AbdominocentesisExploratory laparotomy • If no response to non-specific treatment • Suspected foreign body / mass • Suspected septic peritonitits • Biopsy if abdomen looks grossly normal Conclusions • Not a comprehensive overview of the veterinary clinical examination for all species • Introduced key concepts to apply in case studies • Refine your problem-solving approach to clinical evaluation with experience and as your knowledge expands: • Modified questions that are asked • Refined problem lists • Prioritised lists of differential diagnoses","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
