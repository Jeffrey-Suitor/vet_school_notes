Infrequently, necropsy examination may reveal specific diagnostic information in the rumen or reticulum, e.g. an aromatic odour and pine needles consistent with ingestion of alkaloid-containing yews (Taxus spp.) or characteristic foliage of cyanogenic glycoside-containing plants such as Prunus spp.(plums, cherries, peaches, apricots, almonds). Seizuring calf with lead flakes apparent in the abomasum at necropsy The forestomach compartments should be hosed gently with water to remove content and allow identification of mucosal hyperaemia, erosions, ulcers or scars. The height of the ruminal papillae is an indicator of the previous diet of the animal. Bloat in a cow Bloat in a cow Experiment to measure the volume of eructation gases produced from the forestomach of a cowRuminal contractions to allow eructation of carbon dioxide and methanePrimary or pasture bloat is usually associated with consumption of succulent legumes such as clover. Sawhorse posture and abdominal distension in a cow dead from bloat Necropsy examination of a cow that died from bloat – note the congestion of tissues towards the head and the pallor of the hindquarter tissues Necropsy examination of a cow that died from bloat – note the congestion of tissues towards the head and the pallor of the abdominal viscera and hindquarter tissues Oesophageal bloat line in a cow (the oesophagus has been retracted during the necropsy examination – the congested portion is the cranial segment of the oesophagus) Oesophageal bloat line caudal cranial Oesophageal bloat line Frothy ruminal contents from a cow with primary bloatRuminal contents (right) and pale hindquarter muscles (left) from a cow with primary bloatOesophageal groove in a suckling calf (left) and in a weaned calf at 6 weeks of age (right) Putrefied milk in the rumen of a calf (“ruminal drinker”)Rumenitis in a “ruminal drinker” calfForeign body (plastic garbage bag) in the rumen of a cowTrichobezoars from the rumen of a calfTrichobezoars from the rumen of a calf Traumatic reticuloperitonitis – wire penetrating the reticular mucosa Prophylactic rumen magnets Traumatic reticuloperitonitis – wire penetrating the reticular mucosaTraumatic reticuloperitonitis – wire that had penetrated the reticulum Traumatic reticuloperitonitis – foreign body penetration of the reticulum with localised peritonitis Traumatic reticuloperitonitis – foreign body penetration of the reticulum with localised peritonitis Traumatic reticuloperitonitis – foreign body penetration of the reticulum with localised peritonitisSuppurative pericarditis in a cow due to traumatic reticuloperitonitis “Bread and butter” suppurative pericarditis in a cow due to traumatic reticuloperitonitisChronic suppurative pericarditis in a cow due to TRP Goat with vagus indigestion due to abomasal impaction abomasum Sheep with vagus indigestion due to abomasal impaction – note the distension of the rumen abomasum rumen Abomasal impaction in a cow Impacted material in the abomasum of a cow with vagus indigestion.
