VETERINARY BIOSCIENCE: METABOLISM The materials provided (lecture notes, annotated lecture images and practical Question and Answer sheets) should allow you to answer the following questions. • What is meant by the term jaundice? • What is meant by the term cholestasis? • Which part of the normal process of bilirubin metabolism is most vulnerable to disruption and why? • What are the three broad causal mechanisms that you should consider in any jaundiced animal? • Which domestic animal species develop hepatogenous photosensitisation? What clinical signs would make you suspect that an animal has photosensitisation? What is the pathogenesis of hepatogenous photosensitisation? • What is the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy? How may hepatic encephalopathy manifest clinically in domestic animals? What are the typical central nervous system lesions of hepatic encephalopathy? • In what types of liver disease can hypoalbuminaemia develop and why? Is oedema formation caused solely by hypoalbuminaemia common in domestic animals with liver disease? • What are the various mechanisms responsible for ascites development in animals with liver disease? • What is meant by the term portal hypertension? What are some causes of portal hypertension? Why do animals with portal hypertension often develop ascites? What is typical of the abdominal effusion in an animal with portal hypertension? • What are some conditions that can cause increased pressure in the hepatic sinusoids and perisinusoidal spaces and hence increased hepatic lymph formation? What is typical of the ascites fluid that can accumulate in an animal with excess hepatic lymph formation? • In what circumstances might you see an animal pass fresh faeces that are cream or white (acholic)? • Why does hepatic disease potentially predispose to haemorrhage? Conversely, why does hepatic disease potentially predispose to thrombosis? Veterinary Bioscience: Metabolism Lecture 4 2 • What is bilirubinuric nephrosis? Why do some animals with end-stage liver disease (cirrhosis) sometimes develop acute renal failure (hepatorenal syndrome)? • Why do some dogs with portosystemic shunts or liver failure have ammonium biurate crystals in their urine? • What other clinical signs in a dog might make you suspicious of liver dysfunction/failure?
