Vaccination • Large range of vaccines around the world • Lesser number in Australia as some not needed (e.g. FMD) • Most vaccinations are given under the skin (subcutaneous), most commonly using 16 or 18G needle • Vaccination needles are generally short (about 1cm), whereas needles for intramuscular injection tend to be more than 2cm long – note that needle length often reported in imperial measure • The gauge that reports the width of a needle comes from wire gauge measuring system Common vaccinations • Clostridial (often 5 in 1) • Adding in Leptospirosis = 7 in 1 • Others • BRD • Johnes disease • Pestivirus • Pinkeye • 3 day sickness • Vibriosis • Generally injected high in neck, under skin – but give according to label directions! • Vaccine generally comes in a “pillow pack” • Commonly given to calf 4-6 weeks apart and then yearly (but follow directions) Castration • Reduce aggressive bull behaviour • Bull injury • EHS • Reduce infrastructure damage on fences etc • Bulls grow more quickly than steers and less fat at same weight • Good guide on process at https://futurebeef.com.au/resources/castration/ • Pain relief now available (registered) • Ring/knife (+/- emasculator)/Burdizzo are options Dehorning/disbudding • Can check full MLA guidelines at https://futurebeef.com.au/resources/dehorning/ • Dehorning beef calves generally done later than dairy as dairy calves are already in sheds so can be done in small batches • Usually done in conjunction with ear tagging, castration, vaccination etc • Variable age, depending on calving period duration and if 1 or more musters • More variable in Northern Australia compared to Southern (generally) Dehorning/disbudding • Young calves use heat to disbud (<2 months age) • Dehorning knife • Scoop or cup (<12 mth) dehorner • Guillotine, surgical wire, saw • Pain relief Branding (fire) • Mostly done in northern extensive systems – limited access to freeze brand equipment (dry ice or liquid nitrogen) • Each property has own registered brand to allow lifelong identification • Useful in extensive enterprises where stock may wander eg loss of fences during wet season https://www.business.qld.gov.au/industries/farms-fishing- forestry/agriculture/livestock/animal-welfare/branding-livestock/three-piece-brands Drench • Drenching historically = giving product per os • More recently associated primarily with parasite control (by mouth, injection or pour-on) • Different “families” of anthelmintics • Timing of drenching varies between environments, less likely on more extensive enterprises due to lower numbers of parasites • Some anthelmintics short acting, some longer • Generally given at weaning time (and not before) Weaning weight • Relatively common to collect weight at weaning, particularly in stud enterprises (EBV) • Assess growth on dam and need for further growth • Electronic scale now common using NLIS https://am.gallagher.com/en-AU/Solutions/Weighing-and-EID-Solutions#case-studies Weaning process • Yard weaned versus non (weaned via a fence or weaned out of sight e.g. move to a different property away from dams) • Yard weaning useful as an education process for young stock, feedlots prefer yard weaned stock as calmer in that environment • Allows contact with people, vehicles, dogs etc • Nanny cattle (older cattle) may be used","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
