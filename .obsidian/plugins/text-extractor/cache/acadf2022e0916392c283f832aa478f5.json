Some of the examples of specific causes of diarrhoea that we will review include primary maldigestive disorders, bacterial, viral and parasitic infections, immune- mediated disorders and neoplasia of the intestines. We will also review the potential consequences of diarrhoea and provide guidelines to assist in distinguishing diarrhoea of small versus large intestinal origin in small animal species.
