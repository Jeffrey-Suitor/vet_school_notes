During the Age of Enlightenment in the 18th century, contrasting positions on the capacities of animals were symbolised by the views of the philosophers René Descartes (animals were unfeeling “automata”) and Jeremy Bentham, who argued that animals could suffer. In the 19th century, the debate moved on to whether animals should be granted a degree of protection against suffering. In 1822, Richard Martin pushed for the first anti-cruelty bill in the UK parliament, which granted protection for cattle, horses and sheep. Although, for many at the time, the idea of compassion for animals was seen as a bizarre concept, the formation of what became The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) soon followed, in 1824. During the past century, community views on animal welfare have moved from being concerned only with acts of wanton cruelty toward animals, to concerns about standards of animal care. An area of focus of this public concern has been systems where animals are kept for profit, such as agriculture. Intensive farming systems, where animals are managed in man-made environments, have received particular attention from animal welfare interest groups, and were the subject of the first farm animal welfare campaigns and regulatory scrutiny during the 1960s and 1970s. Concepts of animal welfare and its measurement It is probably under-recognised that the concepts and definitions involved in animal welfare provoke almost as much debate among professionals directly working within this field as the welfare issue does within society at large. Many people prefer to differentiate between defining animal welfare as a concern for the highest standards of care for animals, and animal rights as a philosophical concept that translates into an avoidance of the utilisation of animals. Within the animal welfare spectrum, some concepts act essentially as checklists that may be used as screening tools, or to support “tick-box” welfare assurance. The UK’s Farm Animal Welfare Council’s “Five Freedoms” are an influential example (Farm Animal Welfare Council 1993). The Five Freedoms incorporate elements relating to nutrition, health, normal behaviour, comfort and psychological stress of animals. As can be seen from Table 1, although concepts such as the Five Freedoms may be a useful screening tool, they do not easily translate to objective measurement for herd improvement or selection purposes. Table 1. The Five Freedoms Freedom Explanatory detail 1. Freedom from hunger and thirst By ready access to fresh water and a diet to maintain full health and vigour 2. Freedom from discomfort By providing an appropriate environment including shelter and a comfortable resting area 3. Freedom from pain, injury or disease By prevention through rapid diagnosis and treatment 4. Freedom to express normal behaviour By providing sufficient space, proper facilities and company of the animal’s own kind 5. Freedom from fear and distress By ensuring conditions and treatment which avoid mental suffering More complex models of animal welfare attempt to understand what constitutes normal levels of these welfare components, and what the consequences may be for the animal if they are not normal. The most widely-utilised definition views animal welfare as an optimal condition of the animal’s biology. An alternative model of animal welfare argues that how an animal feels is the prime determinant of its welfare. The biological state concept of animal welfare readily incorporates the various challenges to animal welfare that can occur, such as infectious disease, congenital defects, physical trauma, thermal challenges, and perturbations in the animal’s social environment. The biological responses that result can be used to assess animal welfare. Such responses may include alterations in behaviour, physiological changes, clinical signs of disease, reductions in weight gain and reduced reproduction. Current concepts of animal welfare seek to integrate the underpinning biology with the importance of animal feelings. An example of this is the ‘Five Domains’ model, which also uses the components of animal welfare identified in the Five Freedoms. Figure 1. The Five Domains model. From Mellor et al.
