Amino acids 2. VFA 3. Vitamins B and K • Coated in mucous • Expelled as soft paste in ‘honey comb’ • Pass rapidly through the colon to the anus • Eaten directly from anus • Prey species, easily stressed • Social animals; best in pairs or groups – form strong bonds. FN/MN or MN/MN combos work well • Diet: 70-80% grass hay (Oaten) + 20-30% fresh, leafy greens + 0-5% pellets and treats (Oxbow) • Housing: Variable, but need lots of room to run (time out of cage essential) RabbitsEnvironmental Enrichment A Hutch is NOT Enough! Ideally all rabbits should have a large, secure hutch or indoor cage with access to a large run to allow freedom to express natural behaviour Substrates • Cat litter for the latrine areas – wood based pellets is best • Newspaper • Dust free woodshavings, paper based e.g. Carefresh, compost soil for digging • Hay, hay and hay!!! For eating, for bedding, for eating! • Grass and concrete • Carpet and laminate Environmental Enrichment Express natural behaviours: • Running • Jumping • Standing up on hind legs • Digging • Chewing • Hiding House Rabbits However they are: • Messy (hay) • Destructive – Chewing – Digging Rabbits can make good house pets and can be litter trained NORMAL BEHAVIOUR House rabbits • Secure cage for when unsupervised • Rabbit proofing • Litter tray • Opportunity to dig • Hide box to sleep • Mimics the burrow • Allows escape from companions, humans, other pets etc SexingReproduction • Induced ovulation • Take doe to buck as doe very territorial • Nest-building – pluck hair • Altricial young; suckle for only 3-5 minutes per day Preventative health: • Desexing (females >2yo= uterine adenocarcinoma) • Vaccination- Calicivirus (RHDV), currently recc 6 monthly boosters: Myxomatosis (not Australia) • Ectoparasites- Selamectin (NB- FIPRONIL KILLS RABBITS) • Common diseases: • Gut stasis, • Dental disease (congenital vs acquired) • Pododermatitis • Encephalitozoon cuniculi (protozoan parasite) – neurological and renal disease RabbitsFerrets • Domesticated European polecat • Males= hobs, females=jills • Used for hunting, racing, pets • Intelligent, playful, inquisitive, sleep 18 hrs/day • Seasonal weight and hair loss Ferrets • Housing: Outdoor – hutch or enclosure; use one area/litter tray for latrine,. Indoor – secure cage/room when unsupervised. Regular exercise • Diet: Commercial dry food or whole prey. Stash food, eat frequent small meals Control of breeding • Prolonged oestrus if unmated - hyperoestrogenism • Vasectomised males for sterile matings (induced ovulation). • Surgical neutering linked to adrenal gland disease so NOT recommended. • Hormonal neutering: – “Jill Jab” – proligestone – short term – GnRH agonist implants - males and females Ferrets Preventive medicine: • Hormonal neutering (Deslorelin). • Annual distemper vaccination • Flea/ear mite treatment – eg Selamectin Common diseases: • Adrenal gland disease (if surgically neutered) • Insulinoma • Gastric ulcers • Cardiomyopathy • Lymphoma","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
