The images that were created using this technology have tremendous contrast resolution compared with images acquired using a film-screen system. What this means to the reader is that every image in this book is the highest quality possible and all regions of the part being displayed can be assessed. Both thick and thin parts are assessable, which is something that is impossible when using film screenâ€“based images. Things that are described in the text and labeled in the image can be seen. Imagination is not needed to gain an appreciation for the message being delivered. Over 95% of the images in this book were acquired on clinical patients. This introduces a level of relevance that is extremely valuable in terms of putting radiographic anatomy into per- spective. Because the images were derived from clinical patients, there will be some minor disease that is visible in some images. This is pointed out where it is relevant to make sure that the reader does not misinterpret this as part of the normal variation process. Having absolutely no abnor- mality in any image could have been avoided by imaging cadavers, but the breadth of variation in patient size, age, and breed could not have been duplicated in that instance. The value gained by this variation far outweighs any minor disease that may be seen occasionally.","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
