Each of you should find one article – if two or more of you find the same article search out another one. 1. Who is the organisation that has published the article (eg. is it from a newspaper, welfare organisation, rights organisation, university etc)? 2. What is the background/qualifications of people presenting information in the article (eg. if they are being interviewed. Potentially may just be the single author providing commentary). Detail a short biography if available eg. Name, role, background. 3. What species of animal/s is being discussed? 4. What are the procedures or welfare elements being discussed? 5. What are the listed benefits or welfare impacts of the procedure or elements? 6. Are there any alternatives to improve the particular area that is being discussed? • Do the above task individually and then come together as a group to discuss each one on your Padlet. Please note that there will be many different opinions on animal welfare and this is a good chance to understand how others may think about animal welfare. It is highly likely that not everyone in the group will agree on each topic as is the case within the community. Please be respectful of each others opinions even though they may differ from your own. Nutrition • The first step in any supplementary feeding regime or even knowing what quality pasture is on a property is getting a feed test done. • Can you find any companies in Victoria offering feedtest services? What samples do they require to be submitted to run a feedtest and how should these be collected? • • Going back to one of the properties in question 1 that were stocked at 10,000 DSE in winter (just pick one of them). How would you go about working out the change in DSE over the year? 1. What categories of livestock would you have on the property? 2. How does their DSE rating change over time? 3. Try to work out the DSE for each season of the year listing your assumptions as to when stock leave property or change category. Eg how many DSE for each category in Autumn, Winter, Spring, Summer Lets work with our Hereford commercial enterprise • 10,000 DSE in winter (from French equation) • August calving enterprise • Therefore mid winter = mid/late pregnancy • 10 month old weaner calves (castrate male and female) – assume 0.9 calves per cow • 3 % bulls (this ratio could vary but is a useful starting number) • Use technique from last week (see Week 2 discussion board video) Winter stocking • JULY • 563 cows (11DSE) & 507 (7 DSE) weaners & 17 bulls (15 DSE) • Total DSE we know is 10,000 • 3 months later • Lets say no animals die (unrealistic) • 563 cows & calves at DSE rating of 15 DSE • 253 weaners at rating of 8 DSE • 254 steers at rating of 8 DSE • 17 bulls at 15 DSE • TOTAL DSE in October = 563*15 +507*8 + 17*15 = 12,756 DSE (increased compared to winter) 6 months later • January – at this point we sold all the steers that were 15-18 months old • We have kept heifers until pregnancy tested • Still have calves on the cows • Still have bulls • Increased DSE for cow/calf units and kept heifers same as have reduce growth a little, although they are bigger • 563 cows & calves at DSE rating of 16 DSE (this is increased compared to earlier to note increase in size of calves) • 253 weaners at rating of 8 DSE • 17 bulls at 15 DSE • Total DSE = 11287 9 months later • Calves have been weaned • Heifers pregnancy tested, only need 100 replacement heifers so join for 3 weeks and get this number, sell remainder as PTIC or empty • Sold older cows or cull cows – will bring in 2 year old heifers to replace (as we are operating self replacing system we want to get to the same number of pregnancy cows for winter) • 463 @ 10 DSE cows • Wean 0.9 calves per cow = 505 calves @ 6 DSE • 100 PTIC heifers at rating of 10 DSE • 17 bulls at 15 DSE • Total DSE = 8915 DSE How does this look through the year? Season DSE Winter 10000 Spring 12756 Summer 11287 Autumn 8915 Demand versus supply • This isn’t a perfect fit for our pasture supply curve but is a better fit than if we moved it six months earlier to a Jan/Feb calving (see below) Season DSE Winter 11287 Spring 8915 Summer 10000 Autumn 12756","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
