K E Y W O R D S Foregut fermenter; ruminant; hindgut fermenter; bacteria; nutrition; volatile fatty acids; carbohydrates; rabbits; guinea pigs; kangaroos; herbivores. L E C T U R E O V E R V I E W This lecture considers the role of microbes in digestive function for various animal species. Herbivores have developed different means of accommodating microbes in their digestive tract, in order to digest plant structural carbohydrates. The relative advantages and disadvantages of having bacterial digestion in the forestomach or the hindgut can be compared. While intestinal microbes bring great benefits to the animal, disruption of the microbiome can result in severe disease, and several clinical examples will be illustrated.
