Definitions Conceptus everything that develops from zygote (“product of conception”): – embryo/fetus – extra-embryonic membranes Definitions Embryo (Greek - that which grows): – organism in early stages of development (blastulation, gastrulation and organogenesis) – usually not yet identifiable as member of a species Definitions Fetus (latin: offspring, hatching of young) – controversial definition: often just “more advanced form of an embryo” – can be recognized as member of the species OR – from organogenesis to term Fetal stage ends with expulsion from uterus → neonate Organogenesis/ Basic Body Plan formation Early embryonic development Fertilisation Development inside zona pellucida (Cell division = Cleavage) Hatching of the blastocyst Formation of 3 germ layers (= Gastrulation) Formation of extra- embryonic membranes Sperm transport Fertilisation Fertilisation Secondary oocyte Primary oocyte (=diploid) 1st meiosis (puberty) Secondary oocyte (=haploid) Spermatozoon (=haploid) 2nd meiosis (after fertilisation) Zona pellucida = thick transparent non-cellular layer around oocyte → Needs to be penetrated by sperm cell → changes once first sperm penetrated (=zona reaction) → prevents polyspermy → prevents embryo from growing in size Fertilisation Spermatozoon penetrating corona radiata Spermatozoon penetrating zona pellucida Fusion of cell membrane of spermatozoon and oocyte Entry of spermatozoon into oocyte 2nd meiosis completed Zona reaction Fertilisation Formation of male and female pronuclei Fusion of pronuclei zygote Early embryonic development Fertilisation Development inside zona pellucida (Cell division = Cleavage) Hatching of the blastocyst Formation of 3 germ layers (= Gastrulation) Formation of extra- embryonic membranes Organogenesis/ Basic Body Plan formationUterus Uterine tube 5 days Embryo developmentDevelopment inside zona pellucida Development inside zona pellucida Development inside zona pellucida Early embryonic development Fertilisation Development inside zona pellucida (Cell division = Cleavage) Hatching of the blastocyst Formation of 3 germ layers (= Gastrulation) Formation of extra- embryonic membranes Organogenesis/ Basic Body Plan formation Hatching of the blastocyst Hatching of the Blastocyst Hatching of the blastocyst Species 2-cell 4-cell 8-cell Morula Blastocyst Hatching Bitch 3-7 - - - - 13-15 Cow 24h 1.5 3 4-7 7-12 9-11 Ewe 24h 1.3 2.5 3-4 4-10 7-8 Mare 24h 1.5 3 4-5 6-8 7-8 Queen - - - 5 8 10-12 Sow 14-16h 1 2 3.5 4-5 6 woman 24h 2 3 4 5 5-6 Timing of pre-attachment embryogenesis (after ov.)

Mono- vs dizygotic And how does it work with litters? Twins What about twins? Dizygotic (= derived from 2 zygotes) → 2 ovulations led to 2 oocytes ready for fertilisation by 2 different sperm cells • Hereditary basis Monozygotic (= derived from a single zygote) – explanations: • Development of 2 blastocysts in the same zona pellucida • Development of 2 ICM in the same blastocyst • Splitting of ICM and trophoblast during hatching of blastocyst Twins Are twins good or bad? It depends… Litters Usually each litter mate originates from a separate ovulation (‘multizygotic x-tuplets’) Fertilisation, zona pellucida, twinning, cleavage, 4-cell stage, morula, blastocyst, blastocoele, trophoblast/ ICM, hatching of the blastocyst Early embryonic development Fertilisation Development inside zona pellucida (Cell division = Cleavage) Hatching of the blastocyst Formation of 3 germ layers (= Gastrulation) Formation of extra- embryonic membranes Organogenesis/ Basic Body Plan formation GastrulationThe primitive streak Primitive streak • Median thickened area of embryo • defines cranio-caudal/ longitudinal axis of embryo • In the centre, the primitive groove forms which funnels cells ‘inside’ to form mesoderm and endoderm Mesoderm formation Embryonic mesoderm and lateral mesoderm Notochord formation • primitive streak regresses → primitive node (cranial end of p. streak) continually shifts closer to caudal pole of embryo • Cells around primitive node are deposited beneath ectoderm in midline and form the notochord • Notochord – Signals required for midline symmetry and neural tube formation – Marks future location of vertebral column cranial caudal Gastrulation https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADlYn0ImTNg Early embryonic development Fertilisation Development inside zona pellucida (Cell division = Cleavage) Hatching of the blastocyst Formation of 3 germ layers (= Gastrulation) Formation of extra- embryonic membranes Organogenesis/ Basic Body Plan formation Definitions Conceptus everything that develops from zygote (“product of conception”): – embryo/fetus – extra-embryonic membranes • Amnion • Allantois • Chorion • Yolk sac Extra-embryonic membranes Why does the mammalian conceptus produce tissue outside the embryo?? What is its function? Fetal membranes during parturition They are clinically relevant: during pregnancy after parturition Extra-embryonic membranes Fetal membranesEarly embryonic development Fertilisation Development inside zona pellucida (Cell division = Cleavage) Hatching of the blastocyst Formation of 3 germ layers (= Gastrulation) Formation of extra- embryonic membranes Organogenesis/ Basic Body Plan formation Organogenesis/ Basic Body Plan formation Ectoderm Mesoderm EndodermEctoderm Neurulation = transformation of ectoderm to nervous tissue in response to signal from notochord Neural folds Neural groove Neural plate (= neuroectoderm) Promotes cell proliferation Neural folds converge towards midline Neural tube Neural crest cells Surface ectoderm Neural crest cells arise from dorso-lateral cell migration of neural tube cells Neurulation The central nervous system arises from the neural tube. The peripheral nervous system arises from both the neural tube and the neural crest.
