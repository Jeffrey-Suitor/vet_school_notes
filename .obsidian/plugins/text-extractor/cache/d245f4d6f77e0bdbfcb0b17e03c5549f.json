Introduction to clinical pathology 2. Laboratory evaluation of gastrointestinal disease Case studies: Vomiting Diarrhoea Protein-losing enteropathy (PLE) Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) – Evaluating data and considering further tests What is clinical pathology? Utilisation of laboratory tests to: Diagnose disease Narrow down differential diagnoses (DDx) Direct further investigations Monitor disease progression or response to therapy Screen for underlying disease in clinically healthy animals How to use clinical pathology Appropriate laboratory tests are selected after a full history and complete physical examination Identify a problem list first, to ensure selection of appropriate and cost-effective tests Laboratory tests are frequently used in conjunction with other diagnostic procedures, as part of an integrated diagnostic approach: e.g. imaging, endoscopy, laparotomy, biopsy, treatment trial Learning the lingo Common clinical pathology acronyms (CCPA just joking!) • Haematology – PCV: packed cell volume – Hct: haematocrit – Hb (or Hgb): haemoglobin concentration – RCC: red cell count – MCV: mean corpuscular volume – MCHC: mean corpuscular Hb concentration – RDW: red cell distribution width – WCC: white cell count (aka leukocyte count) – TNCC: total nucleated cell count – Neut: neutrophil (aka seg or polymorph) – Lym (or Lymph): lymphocyte – Mono: monocyte – Eo: eosinophil – Baso: basophil – PLT: platelets (platelet count) – PDW: platelet distribution width Biochemistry: Electrolytes Na: sodium K: potassium Cl: chloride Mg: magnesium Ca: calcium (may also be “Total calcium”) Ca++ : ionised calcium PHOS: Phosphate Anion Gap: calculated value: (Na+K) – (Cl+n) Biochemistry Urea: measured as BUN (blood urea nitrogen) in USA Cr (or CREAT): creatinine Gluc: glucose Chol: cholesterol Bili: bilirubin, usually “total bilirubin” Bili Total ~ Unconjugated + Conjugated BA: (serum total) bile acids Biochemistry: Enzymes ALT: alanine aminotransferase (previously SGPT) AST: aspartate aminotransferase (previously SGOT) AP: alkaline phosphatase (aka ALP, AlkPhos) GGT: gamma glutamyltransferase (aka gamma GT, gGT) SDH: sorbitol dehydrogenase GLDH: glutamate dehydrogenase CK: creatine kinase (previously CPK) TLI: (serum) trypsin-like immunoreactivity Amylase: sometimes AMYL Lipase: sometimes LIP cPL: canine pancreatic-specific lipase cPLI: canine pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity Biochemistry: Proteins TP: total protein (measured biochemically) TS: total solids (refractometer total protein value) Alb: albumin Glob: total globulins A:G (ratio): Alb/Glob Fib: fibrinogen SPE: serum protein electrophoresis Urinalysis (UA): USG: urine specific gravity (‘concentration’) RBC: red blood cells (erythrocytes) WBC: white blood cells (leukocytes) #/LPF: number per low power field (x100 magnification) #/HPF: number per high power field (x400 magnification) TNTC: too numerous to count (lots and lots!) Miscellaneous: Ag: antigen Ab: antibody EDTA: ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid Ig: immunoglobulin SDMA: symmetric dimethyl arginine T4: thyroxine T3: triiodothyronine TPR: temperature, pulse (rate) and respiration (rate) MN or MC: desexed male FS: spayed female NAD: no abnormalities detected NS: not stated WRI: within reference interval WNL: within ’normal’ limits (AbN: abnormal; N: normal) Diagnoses: EPI: exocrine pancreatic insufficiency DM: diabetes mellitus DKA: diabetic ketoacidosis DI: diabetes insipidus HyperA: hyperadrenocorticism HypoT: hypothyroidism etc, etc, etc!! Choosin’ the tube Haematology PCV and TS Complete blood count (CBC) Erythrocytes Hct (PCV), Hb, RCC, MCV, MCHC Leukocytes Total and differential cell counts Platelets Blood smear examination Cell morphology and validation of analyser results Reticulocyte count Coagulation tests ACT: activated coagulation time APTT: activated partial thromboplastin time PT: prothrombin time TT: thrombin time Fibrinogen vWf (VWF): von Willebrand factor FVIII: Factor VIII (similar for other Factors) Transfusion medicine Blood typing Performed when reagents (Ab) are available DEA 1.1 in dogs A, B and AB in cats Cross-matching for compatibility Major crossmatch Donor’s RBC tested against recipient’s serum Minor crossmatch Donor’s serum tested against recipient’s RBC Diagnostic ‘groupings’ • Renal disease: urea, Cr, USG, SDMA • Electrolytes: Na, K, Cl • Acid Base: pH, bicarbonate, anion gap • Minerals: Ca, Phos, Mg • Muscle injury: CK, AST • Liver: ALT, GLDH, AST, ALP, GGT, bilirubin, bile acids • Pancreatic function: amylase, lipase, TLI • Energy metabolism: glucose, cholesterol • Proteins: TP, albumin (globulins) • Biochemistry ‘profiles’ Larger groupings of biochemistry tests Will vary between laboratories Urinalysis Testing the physical and chemical characteristics of fresh urine Collection may be free-catch, catheter or cystocentesis Assessment of: Gross appearance and odour Urine specific gravity (USG) Urine ‘Dipstick’ chemistry Urine sediment (microscopy) Cytology The study of cells: Fine needle aspirate (FNA) or impression smear Skin masses, lymph node (LN) or tissue Body fluids Effusions: peritoneal, pleural, pericardial, synovial Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Washes Tracheal, prostatic, BAL Swabs Vaginal, skin lesions, ears, conjunctiva Sample collection Avoid artifactual changes Good venepuncture technique Correct blood tube Correct ratio of blood to anticoagulant Harvest plasma or serum asap Make ‘fresh’ blood smears Gentle preparation techniques for tissue cytology The ideal patient Is fasted and rested Post-prandial samples may have: Lipaemia Hyperglycaemia Mild azotaemia Excited animals may have: Polycythaemia Physiological leukocytosis Hyperglycaemia In-house Laboratory Simple In-house Laboratory More sophisticated Referral Laboratory ‘Out-sourcing’ Quality control (QC) still begins with YOU! Larger range of tests Provides interpretative support Interpretation of data Providing a pertinent history is important! The more information given to the laboratory, the better the interpretation and comments Ultimate responsibility for interpretation of lab results rests with you, the practitioner You must understand the units, reference intervals and significance of abnormalities Units of measurement Australia, Canada, Europe use SI units USA still use ‘conventional’ units For example: PCV in SI of 0.45 L/L = 45% in USA Total cell count 10 x 109 /L = 10,000/ml Glucose of 5.5 mmol/L = 100 mg/dL TP of 75 g/L = 75 g/dL Urea of 2.1 mmol/L = Urea nitrogen of 6 mg/dL Reference values Reference values (or reference intervals) are results derived from a specified population of clinically healthy animals They may vary according to: Species Breed Age Sex Method of collection Method of analysis Reference intervals (values) Reference intervals usually represent the test results from 95% of the reference (‘healthy’) population Therefore ~ 2.5% of ‘healthy’ animals have values above, and ~ 2.5% below, the reference interval Warnings! Always interpret lab results in conjunction with history, clinical findings and other tests Anticipate expected findings, so that you can: Question unexpected results Identify pathological processes when lab results are within reference limits e.g. an anaemic animal that is also dehydrated may have a ‘normal’ PCV More Warnings! Do NOT over interpret mildly increased or decreased test results (especially if they are ‘unexpected’ or do not fit the clinical diagnosis) Final advice • The more information that you have steering you in the one diagnostic direction, the more certain you can be of the diagnosis • However, remember that common things occur commonly and do not succumb to the paralysis of over-analysis If you hear hoof-beats….. Think horses not zebras! You’ll be right 99% of the time (unless you’re on safari!) Laboratory evaluation of gut disease Laboratory investigations are an important component of the diagnostic approach to gastrointestinal disease by: Narrowing the list of differential diagnoses (DDx) Providing a diagnosis in some cases Directing further investigations Baseline data: Routine haematology, biochemistry, urinalysis Laboratory evaluation of GI disease • Possible other tests/procedures: – Imaging (radiographs, ultrasonography, etc.) – Effusion analysis (TNCC/TP, cytology) – Endocrine (hyperthyroidism, hypoadrenocorticism) – Pancreas (pancreatitis, EPI) – Folate/Cobalamin (intestinal function) – Mass lesions: FNA for cytology or surgical biopsy for histopathology – Faecal tests V & D How do vomiting and diarrhoea affect haematology and biochemistry values? Case 1: Vomiting Sandy; 3-year-old, MN, Labrador retriever History: Vomiting for the past 3 days, especially after meals Clinical examination: Moderate depression. Anorexia. Slight skin tenting. Abdominal guarding on palpation, with possible mass in the anterior abdomen. HR 260 beats/min RR 46 breathes/min Case 1: Vomiting DDx include: • Gastritis/Enteritis • GI obstruction (e.g. foreign body, GDV) • Diseases of other systems: – Pancreatic, hepatic, renal, endocrine – Drugs/toxicity CBC: Marginal erythrocytosis A ‘relative’ increase in RBC is most common Likely secondary to fluid loss (dehydration) and pain (splenic contraction) Inflammatory leukogram, characterized by: Marked mature neutrophilia Mild monocytosis Moderate lymphopenia (‘stress’) Serum biochemistry: • Increased urea (normal creatinine) – Consistent with dehydration (pre-renal azotaemia) • Increased urea absorption in renal tubules • Decreased glomerular filtration rate (hypoperfusion) – Increased urea may also occur with GI bleeding • Less likely in this case, as erythrocytosis and ‘high normal’ albumin support dehydration rather than anaemia • Decreased electrolytes - Na, K, Cl – Electrolyte loss via persistent/severe vomiting – Note that there appears to be a more marked decrease in chloride compared to sodium • Suggests vomiting of gastric contents • Pyloric obstruction or gastritis? Evaluating Na and Cl • Chloride and sodium should move together when changes only relate to water • Determining if there is a selective loss or gain of chloride, helps refine DDx and also suggests an acid base disturbance Calculate “corrected Cl” Cl(cor)= Cl (measured) x (normal Na ÷ measured Na) * normal Na is midpoint of Na ref interval * Cl cor should be within the Cl ref interval • Corrected Cl = 70 x (152/123) = 86.5 • The corrected Cl value is not within the Cl reference interval – thus selective Cl loss is confirmed • Gastric vomiting, concern for pyloric obstruction • Metabolic alkalosis very likely (need blood gas to confirm) Case 1: Outcome Placed on intravenous fluids to correct electrolyte balance and restore hydration Imaging revealed a likely foreign body Exploratory laparotomy was performed A foreign body was found to be obstructing the pylorus Sandy made a full recovery! Case 2: Diarrhoea Bailey; 6-year-old, Arabian gelding History: Participated in endurance ride yesterday. Today off feed, abdominal discomfort, loose faeces. Clinical examination: Mild to moderate depression. Anorexia. Increased gut sounds. Moderate skin tenting. Tacky mucous membranes. CRT 1.5 sec. HR 55/minute. RR 14/minute. Case 2: Diarrhoea In a horse, DDx include: • Infectious agent • Antimicrobial induced colitis • NSAID toxicity • Sand enteropathy • Ingestion of toxicant • Exertional rhabdomyolysis CBC: Mild erythrocytosis Likely secondary to dehydration Supported by physical exam and increased urea with ‘normal’ creatinine (pre- renal azotaemia) Decreased TS Gastrointestinal protein loss most likely Need TP + Albumin to further characterize Leukopenia due to neutropenia with degenerative left shift and lymphopenia Indicates overwhelming inflammatory demand, exceeding the bone marrow’s production capacity Immature neutrophils (bands) released (left shift) Bands exceed mature neutrophils (degenerative) A common feature of severe enteritis caused by an infectious agent (e.g. salmonellosis) Lymphopenia: ‘stress’ response Biochemistry: Hyponatraemia and hypochloraemia Both are moderately decreased Proportionate loss, likely from GIT – Diarrhoea can be explosive event in horses! – Massive fluid and electrolyte losses in a short time Hyperkalaemia Likely secondary to metabolic acidosis – Titrational: lactic acid production secondary to hypovolaemia or ischaemia (anaerobic metabolism) – Secretory: bicarbonate loss with diarrhoea Mildly increased CK (and AST) indicate muscle damage Consistent with prior strenuous exercise and/or ischaemia from recumbency Unlikely to be due to exertional rhabdomyolysis Values would be much greater (CK likely > 10,000 U/L) Presumptive Dx: Salmonellosis Supportive management: IV fluids Made a full recovery after 3 days of treatment Case 3: Protein-losing enteropathy Princess; 5-year-old, FS, Poodle History: Losing weight for last few months, despite a reasonably good appetite Clinical examination: TPR OK. Abdominal distension. A fluid wave was palpable. Hypoproteinaemia: DDx Haemorrhage Renal loss (protein-losing nephropathy) Hepatic ’failure’ Maldigestion/Malabsorption Severe cutaneous exudation Starvation Marked effusion (usually with ‘drainage’) Gut loss (protein-losing enteropathy; PLE) Hypoproteinaemia – can we rule anything out? Haemorrhage Expect panhypoproteinaemia plus anaemia Liver failure Expect decreased alb, chol, glu, urea Protein-losing nephropathy Expect hypoalb, hyperchol, plus proteinuria So this might be a PLE! Expect weight loss, panhypoproteinaemia, hypocholesterolemia Peritoneal fluid • Reference values: Volume, colour and turbidity: Very low volume, colourless and clear TNCC: < 3.0 x 109 /L in small animals < 5.0 x 109 /L in horses Types of cells: Mostly mononuclear cells (macrophages, lymphocytes, mesothelial cells), with rare neutrophils in small animals Mostly neutrophils in horses Protein content: < 25 g/L Effusion Increased volume of fluid in a body cavity: Peritoneal, pleural, pericardial, synovial Classified according to appearance, TNCC, TS, cytology (and possibly other biochemistry tests) • Low protein transudate • High protein transudate (modified transudate) • Exudate • Other Haemorrhagic effusion Chylous effusion Uroperitoneum Neoplastic effusion Effusions Transudate ‘Normal’ gross appearance ’Low’ cell count, ‘low’ protein Hypoalbuminaemia (<15 g/L) Local and systemic venous hypertension, e.g. chronic hepatic disease, such as portosystemic shunt or cirrhosis High protein transudate (modified transudate) Mild increase in protein, ‘normal’ TNCC Congestive heart failure, thrombosis of caudal vena cava, ‘early’ cases of organ torsion Exudate Usually discoloured and turbid Increased TNCC and TS Inflammation (increased vascular permeability at serosal surfaces) Neutrophils usually predominate Macrophages may be numerous and phagocytic If cause is bacterial infection may see degeneration of neutrophils and presence of organisms Bile leakage, chylous effusion, uroperitoneum and neoplasia may cause an exudate Haemorrhage Haemorrhage or diapedesis of RBC can be part of an exudate or other effusions ‘A little bit of blood goes a long way’ DDx blood contamination at collection Platelets indicate haemorrhage at collection Phagocytosis of RBC and/or haemosiderinophages indicate prior haemorrhage Haemorrhagic effusion may occur in its ‘own right’ Usually in a coagulopathy, e.g. vitamin K antagonist poisoning Other effusions Bile peritonitis Fluid may have a ‘gritty’ texture Bile is irritant; provokes a good inflammatory response [Total bilirubin] in fluid > blood Chyloabdomen Fluid often opalescent (likely more so in chylothorax, due to chylomicrons) Initially cells are almost all small lymphocytes With time, increase of neutrophils and macrophages Uroperitoneum Urine is irritant; provokes an inflammatory response Initially [Urea] in fluid >>> blood; ditto [Creatinine] With time, these substances equilibrate across the peritoneum; urea equilibrates more rapidly In uroperitoneum, fluid [Urea] and [creatinine] will always be greater than the corresponding blood value Cases develop a marked hyperkalaemia (with clinical consequences) Neoplasia Effusion may appear as a transudate, modified transudate or exudate Neoplastic cells may or may not be visible Causes include: lymphosarcoma, metastatic tumours (especially carcinomas), haemangiosarcoma, mast cell tumour, mesothelioma Mesothelial cells Haemorrhagic effusion Case 3: Peritoneal fluid analysis Gross appearance: 20 ml of clear and colourless fluid easily collected Cytology: Good cell morphology: mostly lymphocytes and large mononuclear cells, little phagocytic activity Interpretation: Transudate Outcome Primary DDx = Protein-losing enteropathy Associated with a number of GI disorders eg IBD, lymphangiectasia, lymphoma, parasitism… Need further diagnostics! Princess underwent an exploratory laparotomy for intestinal biopsy Histopathology report: Lymphangiectasia Lymphangiectasia ‘Lacteal dilation’ Most commonly reported cause of PLE in dogs Most cases are idiopathic Some are congenital or secondary to obstruction Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency Loss of pancreatic enzymes: Lipase, Amylase and Proteases (eg trypsin) Leads to maldigestion Causes include: Pancreatic acinar atrophy …which breed is predisposed? Secondary to chronic pancreatitis Extensive loss of pancreatic mass required before signs of EPI evident (~ 90%) Clinical signs: Chronic diarrhoea Voluminous, pale, greasy, rancid faeces Weight loss, good appetite (coprophagia) Routine clinical pathology diagnostics: Haematology and serum biochemistry usually unremarkable Interestingly amylase and lipase are WRI … why? Panhypoproteinaemia usually not a feature OK, so how do we confirm EPI? Faecal tests for maldigestion have poor Sn/Sp and are no longer used routinely (Faecal fat/starch/mm + faecal proteolytic activity) Serum TLI Trypsin-like Immunoreactivity test High Sn/Sp, species specific EPI is confirmed by subnormal fasting sTLI < 2.5 ng/mL (RI healthy dogs: 5.2 – 35 ng/mL) Persistent low normal may be subclinical EPI False negatives: Non-fasted, decreased GFR, active pancreatitis Intestinal function tests Serum folate and serum cobalamin Used to evaluate intestinal function (absorption) Vitamin B12 abnormalities are common with EPI 82% dogs, 100% cats can have decreased cobalamin (folate can vary depending on concurrent disease) Recommended to assess folate & cobalamin with TLI Supplementation with vit B12 may be necessary before an optimal response to enzyme supplementation is achieved In addition, if TLI is normal, then finding a decreased folate and cobalamin supports a malabsorption disorder … don’t forget the faeces","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
