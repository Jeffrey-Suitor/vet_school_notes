Fixation Embedding Cutting Staining 4 H&E 5 H&E Colour Atlas of Veterinary Histology Things to consider while examining slides • Two-dimensional representation of a three-dimensional structure • When a tubular structure is cut in different planes the appearance will vary • Various artifacts – Post-mortem change – Variation in staining – Folds in section – Air bubbles in mounting medium – Shrinking of tissue 67 Interpreting sections Colour Atlas of Veterinary Histology 8 Artifacts Fold Stain precipitate Knife marks Separation artifact Terminology Staining Characteristics • Eosinophilic – pink - cytoplasm • Basophilic – blue – DNA and RNA Naming of cells – Cells with ‘blast’ at the end - e.g., Fibroblast – Cells with ‘cyte’ at the end - e.g., Fibrocyte 9 Tongue, Dog Types of tissue • Connective tissue • Epithelial tissue • Muscular tissue • Nervous tissue 10 https://medlineplus.gov/ency/imagepages/8682.htm Molecules Cells Tissue Organs Organ systems Organism Summary • Introduction to histology • How to process tissues for histological examination • Artifacts • Terminology • Types of tissue 11Molecules Cells Tissue Organs Organ systems Organism Microscopic Anatomy Connective Tissue Dr Smitha Georgy Senior Lecturer Veterinary Pathology s.georgy@unimelb.edu.au VETS30015 / VETS90121 Connective Tissue (CT) Function of Connective Tissue: • Support • Transportation • Energy source • Storage • Inflammation and tissue repair 13 http://leifsaul.com/tag/connective-tissue/ Composition of connective tissue 14 Cells (1) Extracellular material (2,3) • Amorphous (2)– no shape • Fibrous (3) 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 3 Umbilical cord, Cow Connective tissue cells 15 Cells: • Mesenchymal cell • Fibroblast • Fibrocyte • Adipocyte • Macrophage • Mast cell • Plasma cell • Melanocyte Mesenchymal cells Connective tissue cells 16 Cells: • Mesenchymal cell • Fibroblast • Fibrocyte • Adipocyte • Macrophage • Mast cell • Plasma cell • Melanocyte Fibroblasts Connective tissue cells 17 Cells: • Mesenchymal cell • Fibroblast • Fibrocyte • Adipocyte • Macrophage • Mast cell • Plasma cell • Melanocyte Connective tissue cells 18 Cells: • Mesenchymal cell • Fibroblast • Fibrocyte • Adipocyte • Macrophage • Mast cell • Plasma cell • Melanocyte Adipocytes Connective tissue cells 19 Cells: • Mesenchymal cell • Fibroblast • Fibrocyte • Adipocyte • Macrophage • Mast cell • Plasma cell • Melanocyte Connective tissue cells 20 Cells: • Mesenchymal cell • Fibroblast • Fibrocyte • Adipocyte • Macrophage • Mast cell • Plasma cell • Melanocyte Macrophages Dog Uterus Connective tissue cells 21 Cells: • Mesenchymal cell • Fibroblast • Fibrocyte • Adipocyte • Macrophage • Mast cell • Plasma cell • Melanocyte Mast cells Connective tissue cells 22 Cells: • Mesenchymal cell • Fibroblast • Fibrocyte • Adipocyte • Macrophage • Mast cell • Plasma cell • Melanocyte Plasma cells Composition of connective tissue 23 Cells (1) Extracellular material (2,3) • Amorphous (2)– no shape  Fluid  Jelly  Solid • Fibrous (3) 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 3 Umbilical cord, Cow Connective tissue – Jelly like ECM 24 Amorphous extracellular material Cells Extracellular material • Amorphous  Fluid  Jelly  Solid • Fibrous Connective Tissue - Fibrous ECM 25 Extracellular material • Amorphous • Fibrous  Collagen fibers  Reticular fibers  Elastic fibers Skin, Horse Connective Tissue - Fibrous ECM 26 Extracellular material • Amorphous • Fibrous  Collagen fibers  Reticular fibers  Elastic fibers Reticular fibres Connective Tissue - Fibrous ECM 27 Extracellular material • Amorphous • Fibrous  Collagen fibers  Reticular fibers  Elastic fibers Skin, Horse Verhoeff-van Gieson’s stain Connective Tissue - classification 28 Connective Tissue (CT) Embryonic CT Mucous CT CT proper Supporting CT Cartilage Bone Fluid CT Blood Connective Tissue - classification 29 Connective Tissue (CT) CT proper Loose CT Adipose tissue Reticular tissue Dense CT Regular CT Irregular CT Classification - CT Loose CT Dense, irregular CT Dense regular CT 7 - nucleus 3 - collagen fiber Skin Horse Tendon Thank you! 31 http://leifsaul.com/tag/connective-tissue/","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
