In congenital portosystemic shunts, there is a single anomalous blood vessel. Small liver in a dog with a congenital extra-hepatic portosystemic shunt Dog with a congenital extra-hepatic portosystemic shunt connecting the gastric vein with the intra-thoracic azygous vein Small liver size with a sharp lobe border and close proximity of portal areas in a dog with a congenital portosystemic shuntNormal portal area in a dog – in health, the portal vein branch is the largest structure in the portal area portal vein bile ducts hepatic artery lymphatics Portal area from a dog with a portosystemic shunt. The portal vein branch is no longer obvious and there is increased prominence of hepatic arteriolar branches (arrows). Portal area from a dog with a portosystemic shunt. The portal vein branch (red arrow) is reduced in diameter and there is increased prominence of hepatic arteriolar branches (black arrows). Comparable histological changes may be seen whenever there is a reduction in portal venous inflow to the liver, e.g. in animals with congenital hypoplasia of the portal vein. Comparable histological changes may be seen whenever there is a reduction in portal venous inflow to the liver, e.g. in animals with congenital hypoplasia of intra-hepatic branches of the portal vein (so-called microvascular dysplasia) (right). Congenital Cysts Sheep – congenital hepatic cyst (serosal inclusion cyst)Sheep – congenital serosal inclusion cystCat – congenital polycystic bile ducts Cat – congenital polycystic bile ductsCongenital polycystic exocrine pancreatic ducts in a sheep Cat – congenital polycystic kidney disease (PKD) Some forms of intra-hepatic bile duct malformations (ductal plate malformations, DPM) are associated with gradual cystic dilation (ectasia) of the ducts (left) whereas others eventually are obliterated by fibrosis (right). The earlier the onset of the malformation, the larger the lesion and the closer to the hilus of the liver (bottom). The later the onset of the malformation, the smaller the lesion and the more peripheral its location in the liver (top). (ADPKD = autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, ARPKD = autosomal recessive PKD, CHF = congenital hepatic fibrosis, in human classification of congenital ductal plate malformations) Dog – congenital dilation of the large intra-hepatic bile ducts (akin to Caroli’s disease in humans) Cat – congenital hepatic fibrosis Cat – congenital polycystic disease (akin to the cysts seen in humans with late onset ductal plate malformations in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (PKD) Cat – congenital cystic bile duct (ductal plate malformation)Cat – congenital cystic bile duct (ductal plate malformation) Hepatic AtrophyThe liver undergoes diffuse atrophy (nutritional atrophy) in starvation or cachectic illnesses. Small liver in a dog with a congenital extra-hepatic portosystemic shunt – diversion of portal venous blood deprives hepatocytes of nutrients and trophic hormones from the endocrine pancreas Sharp hepatic lobe border and narrow hepatocellular cords in a dog with a congenital portosystemic shunt (H&E stain) Narrow hepatocellular cords and passively distended sinusoids in a dog with a congenital portosystemic shunt (H&E stain) Chronic low-level exposure of hepatocytes to alkylating toxins such as pyrrolizidine alkaloids (contained in Paterson’s curse, Echium plantagineum, above) interferes with hepatocellular mitotic division and may cause gradual hepatic atrophy as dead cells are not replaced. Localised atrophy of the liver occurs in the immediate vicinity of space-occupying masses such as abscesses (above) or tumours. Ox – chronic fascioliasis with atrophy of the left liver lobe – chronic obstruction of bile drainage is a common cause of localised hepatic atrophy Degeneration of Hepatocytes Mild hydropic degeneration of hepatocytes in centre of image (acute cell swelling due to sublethal injury and intra-cellular accumulation of water) (H&E stain) Moderately severe hydropic degeneration of hepatocytes in centre of image (acute cell swelling due to sublethal injury and intra-cellular accumulation of water) (H&E stain) In intra-hepatic cholestasis (above, H&E stain) and chronic stages of extra-hepatic cholestasis, retention of bilirubin and especially bile salts within hepatocytes can result in sublethal degeneration (so-called feathery degeneration) and even necrosis of hepatocytes. Dog with hyperadrenocorticism – liver enlargement due to excess hepatocellular synthesis and storage of glycogen contributes to the pot- bellied appearance Glycogen storage within hepatocytes in steroid hepatopathy (H&E stain) – note the morphological resemblance to intra-cellular water accumulation Severe vacuolar degeneration of hepatocytes due to glycogen storage in steroid hepatopathy in a hyperadrenocorticoid dog (H&E stain)Dog - steroid hepatopathy – note that there is a subtle zonal pattern because, in the early stages of this condition, glycogen may be preferentially stored in zone 2 (midzonal) hepatocytes Steroid hepatopathy in a dog with preferential glycogen storage within zone 2 (midzonal) hepatocytes (H&E stain) Hepatic lipidosis – large, sharply demarcated, clear, intracellular vacuoles of triglyceride (H&E stain) Higher magnification of hepatic lipidosis (H&E stain) – large triglyceride vacuoles can displace the cell nucleus to the periphery (arrows) Hepatic lipidosis can result from any process that overloads or impairs lipid metabolism within hepatocytes. A common bottleneck in hepatic lipid metabolism is the synthesis and export back into the bloodstream of very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) by hepatocytes. Dog – severe diffuse hepatic lipidosis due to poorly controlled diabetes mellitus Cat – gross zonal pattern due to zonal hepatic lipidosis – in the early stages of hepatic lipidosis, triglycerides may accumulate particularly in zone 3 (periacinar or centrilobular) hepatocytes Dog – friable hepatic parenchyma due to severe lipidosis Diffuse Hepatic Lipidosis • physiological - e.g. suckling neonates • fasting of especially obese animals • high energy or high lipid diets • sublethal toxic or hypoxic injury to hepatocytes Diffuse Hepatic Lipidosis • endocrine disorders - especially diabetes mellitus • ketosis - heavily pregnant or lactating dairy cows • pregnancy toxaemia - pregnant ewes • bovine fatty liver syndrome • feline hepatic lipidosis • equine hyperlipaemia/hyperlipidaemia syndrome • deficiency of cobalt and/or vitamin B12 - lambs, kids • fatty liver haemorrhagic syndrome - layer hens • fatty liver kidney syndrome - broiler chickens Severe diffuse hepatic lipidosis in a cow with ketosis Cow displaying neurological signs due to ketosis (ketoacidosis) Cow – tension lipidosis of hepatic parenchymaCat – severe hepatic amyloidosis (H&E stain) In domestic animals, extracellular amyloid deposits are most often derived from the acute phase protein, serum amyloid A, produced by hepatocytes. A thorough body-wide search for a site of chronic tissue inflammation or other injury is therefore warranted. Cat – amyloid deposits in the perisinusoidal space (space of Disse) (arrows) (H&E stain) sinusoid atrophic hepatocytes Cat – hepatic amyloid deposits in the perisinusoidal spaces stained orange with Stokes stain Hepatic Pigmentation Dog – jaundice of the liver and its connective tissues due to immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia Dog with an extra-hepatic bile duct obstruction – diffuse dark green discolouration of the liver parenchyma due to retained conjugated bilirubin Intra-hepatic cholestasis with plugging of canaliculi by bile (H&E stain)Calf – multifocal congenital melanosis of the liver Haemosiderin accumulation by Kupffer cells (H&E stain) in an animal with a chronic extravascular haemolytic anaemia Haemosiderin accumulation within hepatocytes in a human with inherited haemochromatosis (H&E stain) Prussian blue stain to demonstrate iron accumulation in hepatocytes in a human with inherited haemochromatosis Lipofuscin pigment accumulation in zone 3 (periacinar or centrilobular) hepatocytes in an aged cat (H&E stain) Sheep – acquired environmental lipofuscinosis of the liver (“mulga liver”) Sheep – acquired environmental lipofuscinosis of the liver (“mulga liver”) Sheep – acquired environmental lipofuscinosis of the liver – accumulation of pigment within periportal hepatocytes and Kupffer cells (H&E stain) Sheep – acquired melanosis of the liver, lungs and renal cortex Ox – black iron-porphyrin pigmentation of a pulmonary lesion caused by aberrant migration of the fluke, Fascioloides magna Sheep – Fasciola hepatica (common liver fluke) within a bile duct – black iron- porphyrin pigment from fluke excrement can stain the bile and discolour the regional lymph nodes Displacement, Torsion and Rupture of the Liver In hepatomegaly (e.g. diffuse lipidosis (top) or steroid hepatopathy (bottom)), the enlarged liver extends caudally within the abdominal cavity. Dog – acquired diaphragmatic herniation of a liver lobe Dog – chronic liver lobe torsion with venous infarction of the affected lobe Dog – traumatic laceration of the liverDog – traumatic laceration of the liverHorse – spontaneous rupture of a fatty liver with acute haemoperitoneum Cat – spontaneous rupture of the liver due to diffuse amyloidosis, resulting in fatal haemoperitoneum","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
