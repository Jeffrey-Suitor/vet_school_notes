digestive function Dr Nick Bamford n.bamford@unimelb.edu.au VETS30016 / VETS90120 Intended learning outcomes • Compare the roles of microbes in the digestive function of different animal species, and explain how disruption of the microbiota can result in disease • Explain the role of microbes in the digestive processes of hindgut and foregut fermenting animals • Discuss the relative advantages and disadvantages of: • Microbial digestion in the foregut • Microbial digestion in the hindgut Terminology • Microbes • Microscopic organisms • Bacteria, protozoa, (archaea, fungi, viruses) • Microbiota • Ecological community of microbes • Preferred term to microflora • Microbiome • Genetic makeup of a particular microbial population Introduction • Microbes play a crucial role in digestive processes • Digestive function • Particularly herbivores • Foregut and hindgut serve as fermentation chambers • Digestive health • Protective role against colonization • Promote enterocyte maturation Carnivores • Complex microbiota within colon • Limited bacterial fermentation • Dietary fiber converted to VFAs • Some vitamin synthesis • Promote health of intestinal mucosa • Proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells • Helps to prevent colonisation by harmful bacteria Herbivores • Extract energy from plant cell wall (structural carbohydrates) • Glucose locked up as CELLULOSE • Polymer of β-D-glucose attached by β-(1,4) linkages • Forms insoluble fibres • Mammalian digestive enzymes cannot hydrolyse cellulose Starch Structure of celluloseFermentation • Breakdown of carbohydrates by microbes under anaerobic conditions • Breakdown product of sugars (hexoses) are volatile fatty acids (VFAs) • Absorbed and converted to energy substrates by host HexosePyruvate Lactate/ SuccinateCO2PropionateCH4ButyrateAcetateAcetyl-CoA Foregut fermenters • Microbial fermentation PRIOR to exposure to mammalian digestive enzymes Ruminants • Continuous culture system for anaerobic bacteria • (Plus protozoa and fungi) • VFAs absorbed across the forestomach epithelium • Provide 60–80% of the energy needs of the animal Rumen microbes • 1010 to 1011 bacteria per gram content • Mostly attached to fibres of food material • ≈ 30 important bacterial species identified • Many species unidentified (>300) • Anaerobes • (105 to 106 protozoa per gram, fungi) Bacterial symbiosis • Bacteria produce substrates necessary for other processes • Some bacteria digest cellulose but not protein and vice versa • Cellulose • e.g. Ruminococcus spp. (R. albus), Bacteroides spp. • Starch and sugars • e.g. Streptococcus spp. (S. bovis), Lactobacillus spp. • Protein • e.g. Bacteroides spp. (B. ruminicola), Streptococcus spp. Rumen environment • pH ≈ 6.5 • VFAs buffered by bicarbonate/phosphate in saliva • Low oxygen • Temperature • Osmotic pressure • Antibodies from saliva Rumenocentesis Bacterial protein metabolism • Proteins converted to peptides by bacterial proteases • Used for energy or microbial protein • Also utilise non-protein nitrogen – ammonia, urea • Most protein reaching the small intestine is microbial Ruminant hindgut • Colon and caecum also sustain significant microbial populations • VFA production and absorption • Further bacterial action undigested fibre • (Very fibrous forage) Non-ruminant foregut fermenters e.g. Kangaroos • Not a true ruminant • Greatly expanded forestomach • Very little methane production Hindgut fermenters • Access to feed/nutrients before microbes • Good quality proteins and sugars digested first • Similar to carnivores and omnivores • Mainly indigestible fibre acted on by bacteria • Also other carbs not hydrolysed by mammalian enzymes • e.g. fructans, pectins, β-glucan, resistant starch • Not as efficient at digesting fibre as ruminants • Digesta not held in GI tract for sufficient time HorseBacteria in the equine stomach • Limited fermentation in the saccus caecus • 108 to 109 bacteria per gram ingesta • Digestion of some starch and fructan carbohydrate to VFAs • Large starchy meals – gastric ulcers Horse: Caecum and colon • Large volumes of ingesta • Similar conversion of substrates to that of rumen microbes • ≈ 1010 bacteria per gram content • Cellulose • e.g. Ruminococcus spp., Fibrobacter spp. • Starch and sugars • e.g. Streptococcus spp., Lactobacillus spp. • Populations always changing • Composition of diet • Meals vs grazing Rabbits • Hindgut fermenters • Large caecum (40% of intestinal contents) www.fao.org Caecotrophy • Some products of hindgut digestion will not be absorbed • Specialised type of coprophagy – consumption of faeces • Caecotrophs • Contain microbes, amino acids, VFAs, vitamins • Mucous coating Guinea pigs • Also caecotrophic • Very large caecum • 65% of GI contents • Gut flora contains many similar types of bacteria to rabbit & horse Disturbances of intestinal microbiota • Balance between different microbes Inflammatory bowel disease • Canine IBD associated with dysbiosis • Microbiome requires further study Therapies for dysbiosis? • Probiotic • Formulation of live beneficial whole bacteria • Various licensed products • Prebiotic • Substrate that promotes growth of beneficial bacteria • e.g. psyllium, pectin, beta-glucan Ruminal acidosis • Excess dietary hydrolysable carbohydrate • Streptococcus spp. and Lactobacillus spp. ferment starch • Lactic acid • Acute form • pH < 5.5 → other bacteria die, acidic damage to rumen mucosa → fluid movement into rumen → dehydration • Subacute form • Rumenitis, dysbiosis • Decreased energy production and absorption • Reduced growth, illthrift Carbohydrate overload Sucrose, Fructose Starch Fibre, Fructans, Starch overload Too much fermentable carbohydrate may cause bacterial overgrowth and toxin production (>0.4% bwt) Fructan carbohydrates • Storage form of carbohydrate in stems of grasses • Polysaccharides of one glucose with many fructoses • Both β-(2  1) and β-(2  6) linkages • Resistant to mammalian enzymes • Susceptible to bacterial enzymes • Lush grass high in fructans (e.g. spring) can cause hindgut disturbances Fructan Carbohydrate overload • Streptococcus spp. and Lactobacillis spp. ferment starch or fructan carbohydrates to lactic acid • Other bacteria die • Numbers increase 100 – 1000 X in few hours • pH drops, damage to caecal mucosa • Bacterial toxins released into circulation • Horses exquisitely sensitive to effects of bacterial toxins Lipopolysaccharide (endotoxin) • Outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria 1. O-antigen (O-polysaccharide) 2. Core oligosaccharide 3. Lipid A • LPS (endotoxin) is highly antigenic and in the circulation will cause massive systemic inflammatory response Endotoxaemia Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) Enteritis in guinea pigs • Hindgut microbiota disrupted by stress, illness • Intestinal stasis • Secondary to antibiotic therapy • e.g. Oral penicillin • Overgrowth of Clostridium spp. • Potent toxins • Diarrhoea and dysentery Colour-enhanced scanning electron micrograph of rod-shaped Clostridium difficile clinging to gut microvilli Transfaunation • Process of transferring microbe-rich digestive contents from one individual to another • Rumen contents in cows • Faeces or caecal contents in horses • Repopulate gut with healthy microbiota Mullen et al. Equine Vet. Edu. Summary: Foregut fermenters • Can consume large amount of feed rapidly • Higher efficiency at extracting nutrition from feed • Rumination, additional fermentation in caecum/colon • Advantageous when fibre is high, overall intake low • Loss of easily available energy to fermentation • ‘Microbial processing cost’ Summary: Hindgut fermenters • Need to eat small amounts frequently • Only one opportunity to chew feed • Digestion occurs before reaching fermentation chamber • Dietary protein, fats and non-structural carbohydrates utilised similarly to carnivores/omnivores • No ‘microbial processing costs’ • Benefit from higher quality diet • Some valuable nutrients & microbial population lost in faeces • Horses digest ≈ 85% cf. cattle • Some species have specialised adaptation – caecotrophy","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
