Addressing the welfare of captive reptilesWhy do we want to keep them as pets?Why do vets want to work with reptiles? • Incredible variation in structure, function and ecology • Forging new ground/ frontier science • Gaining skills few others have • Contact with tame wonderful animals • Finding solutions for difficult or unquantified problems Reptile veterinary frustrations • Paucity of high quality research • Few evidence based academic or lay references • Poor resources: equipment, medication, established evidence based theory and practice • Community education by social media • Our knowledge base is small and we are often working from first principals. • Many vets do not know what they don’t know and a little knowledge can loom large in an industry where little is known. • Speciesism Let’s think beyond the cage • Where do they come from? • Is there an organised and regulated retail industry for supplies? • Where does the pet care information come from and who judges its quality? • What happens when they are lost or unwanted? • Can and should their welfare be regulated and enforced? The Reptile Trade in Victoria • Licensing through the state government (DELWP currently) • Captive breeding • Morbidity and mortality • Selective breeding for beauty/strength/longevity in captivity versus their own habitat • Swap meets • Harvesting from the wild Do the reptiles benefit from captivity? • Reptiles often attract highly engaged owners • This should mean that • Pet needs immediately noted and provided for • Not fighting to survive for themselves • Plenty of attention and food • Humans directing selection to make them better pets Veterinary Roles in the Reptile Trade • Working on welfare • Promoting the sharing of evidence based care • Encouraging people to explore beyond the petshop or forum • Learning from and with the Herpetology community Health Problems in Reptiles • Commonly related to a lack of understanding of the ectotherm • Husbandry is often deficient in one or more of the following • Accessible appropriate thermal range • UVB of the right strength, within the right distance and large enough area • Visible light colour, type and day/night cycle • Balanced diet and appropriate supplementation of minerals • Opportunities for traumatic injury during • Feeding in groups or leaving uneaten live prey with the pet • Vivarium doors and tails, escape attempts • Gardening and turtles • Contagious diseases and parasites Reptile common diseases • Dietary/heat/UVB relationship failing • Metabolic bone disease • Malnutrition (over or underfeeding nutrients) • Gout (excessive protein in diet- urate crystals build up in organs and joints) • Hypovitaminosis A (in herbivores lacking orange and red vegetables) • Poor hygiene (of substrate/air/water) or inappropriate humidity • Dermatitis • Dysecdysis (difficulty shedding) • Stomatitis • Sepsis • Lack or quarantine and biosecurity protocols/outdoor enclosures • Ectoparasites • Neurorespiratory viral infections • Trauma The risks of offering live prey. This python has become the prey and the rat the predator. It is illegal to feed live mammalian or avian prey in Victoria. Live insects and live fish can be offered. However they still pose a significant risk to their predators if they are not eaten. Crickets can chew ulcers into Bearded Dragons. Feeder fish can chew toes off small or lethargic turtles. Trauma by fellow household pets This turtle was chewed by the household dog. This is a common problem in lizards too. Issues of hygiene and malnutrition This is a middle ear abscess in a tortoise (top image). It can arise from an infection in the mouth, stomatitis (bottom image of turtle) or from the respiratory system. Immunity is compromised by inadequate temperature gradient, poor diet and lack of the appropriate access to ultraviolet light, UVA and B. Nutritional secondary hyperparathyroidism Also known as metabolic bone disease. It is cause by a single or multiple deficits in the complex interaction between - UVB exposure - Dietary calcium provision - Access to thermal gradient appropriate to species to enable the animal to reach the preferred body temperature for metabolism - Successful absorption and metabolism of calcium and Vitamin D Proliferative lesions like this could be viral or neoplastic. Papilloma virus. Excessive UV exposure. Reptile zoonoses • Faeco-oral transmission such as • Enteric bacteria such as salmonella • Protozoans such as Giardia • Flukes, tapeworms, roundworms • Ectoparasites- direct or environmental contact • Mites such as Ophionyssus natricus (direct contact) • Ticks (indirect contact from the habitat of the reptile) • Vector borne diseases such as Rickettsia • Puncture wounds allowing introduction of infection such as Mycobacteria Helenki.
