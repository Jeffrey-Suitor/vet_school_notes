In northern Australia wet season normally commences late in calendar year (Nov/Dec) and continues until about April. Indigenous seasons • Based on plant/animal/environment • More seasons • Varies between different areas https://www.herringisland.org/seasons1.htm Pasture types • Wide variety of native and “improved” pastures • Significant cost to establish new pastures (generally seed, fertiliser and cost of sowing plus lost grazing opportunity) • Pasture type varies with rainfall (amount and distribution), soil type, temperature – some pastures are annual and some perennial • Higher rainfall tends to be more perennial (also irrigation) • Temperate plants (C3) in southern Australia • Tropically adapted (C4) plants more likely in north Pasture (cont) • Mixtures of plants • Animal benefit • Plant benefit e.g. clover/rye • Pasture toxicity • Ryegrass, phalaris • Integration of cropping systems Seasonality • Annual rainfall • Distribution rainfall important • >80% of Australia has >= 3 months where no effective precipitation occurs • This happens during dry season in North (our winter months) • In South it tends to be Dec/Jan/Feb (summer) https://www.anbg.gov.au/aust-veg/seasonal-rainfall.html Length of growing season • Determined by combining temperature data, rainfall data and evaporation data along with soil temperature where minimum temperature may limit growth • In Melbourne, normally starts in Autumn and continues until late Spring; varies from suburb to suburb as rainfall pattern varies a little • Some areas of Australia get year round rain so are mostly green while others may only be green for 4-5 months of the year • This is important to understand as it can limit livestock options without supplementary feed Climate change • Variable potential impact on enterprises depending on location in longer term, but already some changes • Many enterprises adding mitigation for climate change • Industry working on reducing methane output from ruminants given potency of CH4 as a greenhouse gas • Likely to have significant impact across catchment zones for irrigation so significant threat to zones likely to receive less water","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
