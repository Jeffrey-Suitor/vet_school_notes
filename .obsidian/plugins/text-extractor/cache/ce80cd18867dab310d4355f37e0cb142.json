Magnitude of concentration gradient » Greater the difference in concentration, faster the rate of net diffusion 2. Permeability of the membrane to the substance » Greater the perr;1eability, faster the rate of net diffusion 3. Surface area of membrane available for diffusion » Larger the surface area, faster the rate of net diffusion 4. Molecular weight of substance . » Heavier the molecule, the slower the rate of net diffusion 5.
