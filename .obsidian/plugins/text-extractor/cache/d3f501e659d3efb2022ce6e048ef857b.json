Equine caecum: gross anatomy Relationships How would you know if the caecum was in the correct position? Equine caecum: gross anatomy Relationships How could you tell if the caecum was distended through rectal palpation? Equine caecum: histology Microscopic architecture What is the function of the caecum at the cellular level? Digestive system functions • Securing food • Conducting and storing food • Mechanical and chemical digestion • Absorption of food • Storage and disposal of wastes Design in different species is adapted to suit the diet Digestive tract 1.

Oesophagus 2. Stomach 3. Small intestine 4. Large intestine • Rectum & anus Four regions: Alimentary canal: wall structure Mucosa Submucosa Muscularis externa Serosa Mesentery Lumen • Mucosa – inner lining layer • Transports nutrient, barrier function • Submucosa – underlying connective tissue layer • Contains blood vessels and nerves • Muscularis externa – major muscle layer • Mixing and peristalsis • Serosa/adventitia – outer connective tissue • Visceral peritoneum Accessory organs & glands • Intrinsic glands • Within walls, release secretions into lumen • e.g. mucus, enzymes • Extrinsic glands • Outside the walls, deliver secretions to lumen via ducts • e.g. salivary glands, pancreas, liver Intrinsic glands Lumen Salivary glands Pancreas Liver Abdominal regions Nine regions: Xiphoid (epigastric) Left hypochondrial Left flank Left inguinal Umbilical Pubic Right hypochondrial Right flank Right inguinal R L Xiphoid process Costal arch Umbilicus Femoral triangle Pubic brim https://www.imaios.com/en/vet-anatomy/dog/dog-general-anatomy-illustrations TerminologyAbdominal cavity: boundaries • Cranial • Diaphragm • Dorsal • Lumbar vertebrae and sublumbar muscles • Arms (crura) of diaphragm Diaphragm Lumbar vertebrae Abdominal cavity: boundaries • Lateral (both sides) • Diaphragm • Three muscle layers of the body wall • Internal and external abdominal oblique; transverse abdominal • Part of the pelvis • Left and right ilium Abdominal cavity: boundaries • Ventral • Left and right rectus abdominis muscles • Caudal • Pelvic inlet Peritoneal cavity • Portion of abdomen and pelvic canal enclosed by peritoneum • Surface area of peritoneum >> skin Abdominal portion Pelvic portion Peritoneum • Parietal • Visceral • Connecting (double layers) • Mesentery • Omentum • Ligaments Visceral peritoneum Parietal peritoneum Connecting peritoneum Descending duodenum (small intestine) Parietal peritoneum (dashed line) R. kidney Aorta Jejunum (small intestine) Spleen L. kidney Root of mesentery Visceral peritoneum (continuous line) (Dyce, Sack and Wensing, p118) Vertebrae Connecting peritoneum (mesentery) Parietal peritoneum Visceral peritoneum Connecting peritoneum (omentum) Connecting peritoneum (mesentery) Pancreas Omental bursa Coronary lig.
