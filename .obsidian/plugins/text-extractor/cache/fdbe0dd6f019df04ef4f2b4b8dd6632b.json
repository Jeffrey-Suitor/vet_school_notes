Larry Loses Heart • What determines heart rhythm? • The sinoatrial (SA) node • The fastest pacemaker will set the rate for other tissues because it will depolarise other cells before they decay to threshold • Anatomically different conducting tissues have different decay rates to threshold SA node > AV node > Bundle of His > Purkinje fibres • The rate set by SA node is referred to as SINUS RHYTHM “Irregular rhythm with variable strength pulse”“Irregular rhythm with variable strength pulse” Problem with generation of the action potential in pacemaker tissue OR Problem with conduction to the ventricles How do we differentiate between these two possibilities? Larry’s ECG trace • Can you identify the R wave? • Is the R-R interval constant? • Can you identify a P wave? • Is every P wave related to a QRS complex? • Does the form of the QRS complex appear normal? Yes No No Well… Yes R-R R-R Larry’s ECG trace • Can you identify the R wave? Yes • Is the R-R interval constant? No – irregular heart rhythm (beats / pulse) • Can you identify a P wave? No – lack of synchronous atrial depolarisation • Is every P wave related to a QRS complex? No P waves • Does the form of the QRS complex appear normal? Yes – normal ventricular conduction / depolarisation Atrial fibrillation (another case with more exaggerated example of inconsistent R-R interval) Ventricular premature contraction (different QRS morphology when contraction originates within ventricle) Why does atrial fibrillation result in an irregular heart rhythm? Random depolarization of atrial cardiac myocytes Disrupted conduction pathways across atrium Random arrival of action potentials at AV node Irregular depolarization of AV node (either spontaneously or following stimulation by arriving action potentials and depending on refractory state of AV node) Irregular conduction of AP to ventricles Irregular contraction / heart beat “Irregular rhythm with variable strength pulse” • What determines pulse strength? • The strength of the pulse we feel depends on the AMPLITUDE of the pulse • Pulse amplitude depends on STROKE VOLUME • So, what determines stroke volume? Importance of ventricular filling • Stroke volume = end diastolic volume – end systolic volume • i.e. the volume of blood ejected with each heartbeat • To have appropriate stroke volume: • Adequate venous return • (Remember Case Study 1 and TRP) • Adequate filling time • Also remember: How does atrial contraction (atrial systole) contribute to ventricular filling – and when is this likely to become significant? Importance of ventricular filling • To have appropriate stroke volume: • Adequate venous return – not a problem with Larry • Adequate filling time – variable diastolic period (T-P / T-R interval) • Contribution of atrial systole to ventricular filling • Very little at rest – mostly passive filling during ventricular diastole • Important part of ventricular filling during exercise – up to 25% contribution • CO = HR x SV • So, reduced stroke volume = reduced cardiac output = poor performance! T-R T-R Importance of ventricular filling • To have appropriate stroke volume: • Adequate venous return – not a problem with Larry • Adequate filling time – variable diastolic period (T-P / T-R interval) • Contribution of atrial systole to ventricular filling • Very little at rest – mostly passive filling during ventricular diastole • Important part of ventricular filling during exercise – up to 25% contribution • CO = HR x SV • So, reduced stroke volume = reduced cardiac output = poor performance! What is a pulse deficit? • A heartbeat occurs but is not accompanied by a palpable arterial pulse • This is different from saying “absence of a pulse” or “dropped beat” • Pulse deficit occurs when ventricular filling time is shortened such that stroke volume is insufficient to generate a palpable pulse Heart sounds Sound Aetiology S1 “lub dub” Closure of the AV valves S2 “lub dub” Closure of the semilunar valves S3 “lub dub-da” Rapid early ventricular filling S4 “ba-lub dub” Atrial contraction Horses vs. dogs • AF in horses often occurs (and resolves) spontaneously – why? • Large heart size – more atrial mass to maintain / propagate AF • High vagal tone – increases spatial dispersion of cardiomyocyte refractoriness • AF in dogs is the consequence of underlying cardiac disease • Cardiac remodelling / fibrosis Treatment of atrial fibrillation • What is the ionic basis of treatment with quinidine? • Quinidine blocks voltage gated sodium channels • Suppresses depolarisation of cardiac myocytes, in particular “rogue” or “ectopic pacemaker” cardiac myocytes that are generating the fibrillation • Quinidine will have no effect on pacemaker tissue – these cells lack VO Na channels – hence allowing pacemaker tissue to restore control of rhythm Transvenous electrocardioversion (TVEC)Weekly quiz • To be completed by 11:59pm Tuesday August 8 • 16 questions worth 21 marks (MCQ, drop down menu)","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
