Scrotum 2. General Physical Examination 3. Crush Side Semen Evaluation 4. Serving Ability Testing 5. Sperm Morphology Testing A measure of RISK  Tick  Qualified  Cross  Not Tested 4 Pregnancy diagnosis in dairy herds • Essential to monitor reproductive performance • Allows identification of “empty” cows • Differentiates between A.I. and natural service pregnancies • Foetal ageing allows farmer to plan “dry off” date 5 Pregnancy diagnosis in dairy cattle - methods • Manual (rectal) – palpation or ultrasound • Most accurate • Can determine foetal age (most accurate between 5-15 weeks pregnancy (6 weeks for ultrasound) • Laboratory (Blood or milk) – • Quite accurate at identifying pregnant cows • Less accurate at identifying empty (non pregnant) cows • Unable to age foetus 6 Source: AVA Condition scoring cattle Cows can change weight rapidly • Eg – 30kg milk, 10 litres urine, 10 kg faeces = 10% change in body weight in a milking! Fat cover is much more consistent Condition score is related to disease and fertility One Condition score = approx. 3000MJ (or 270kg feed) BCS – Pre Calving 21 day Submission Rate Conception Rate 4.5 or less 66% 40% 4.5-5.4 76% 54% Higher than 5.4 75% 51% Condition Scoring Cattle There are many systems of assessing BCS Dairy Cattle score 1-8 in Australia But very few 1,2,7,8 so in practical terms scores are between 3 and 6 2-step “hands-off” scoring method only takes seconds 8 How to body condition score a cow 9 Step 1: a) Deeply sunken b) Sunken c) Slightly sunken d) Filled in 10 Step 2 (depends on step 1) a) Inside of pins b) Backbone c) Area between tail and pins 1112Deeply sunken, but pins not hollowDeeply sunken with hollow pins Sunken Bumpy ridge Slightly sunken, no bumpy ridgeSlightly sunken, bumpy ridge 19 Filled in 20 AEPS – DAIRY WEEK 1 21","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
