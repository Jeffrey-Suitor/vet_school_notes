Overall fat cover is also assessed including any hide puller damage • pH and temperature – pH is measured using a pH meter and must be below 5.71. The temperature should be below 12˚C, according to AUS-MEAT standards < 25% Example breeding program Composite Development Barkly Composite Gulf Composite Breed - Senepol 25.0% 25% - Charolais 25.0% 25% - Santa Gertrudis 50.0% - Brahman 50% F1 Heterosis 62.5% 65.6% Bos Taurus overall 75.0% 50% • Senepol = tropically adapted Bos taurus (slick coat gene) – derived from a cross between Red Poll and N’Dama (from Senegal), hence the name • Tuli are another tropically adapted Bos taurus breed (cream colour) • Bos taurus infusions to improve meat quality • Meat Standards Australia guidelines allow maximum 25% Bos indicus to meet maximum quality standards Frame Score • Overall size of cattle is determined by frame score • Measured from 1-10 • Can assess via measuring hip height versus their age • Later maturing animals have higher frame score • British breed tend to be 1-7, Euro 4-9 • Higher frame score = higher DSE https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/animals-and-livestock/beef- cattle/appraisal/publications/frame-scoring Frame score and production system","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
