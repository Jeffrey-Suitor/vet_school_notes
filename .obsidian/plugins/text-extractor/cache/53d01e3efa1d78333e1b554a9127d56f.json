This case study is designed to enhance your understanding of: • The role of the incisors and molars of the horse in prehension and mastication of food • The importance of appropriate mechanical digestion of food in the mouth in achieving adequate nutrient absorption • The effects of ageing and wear on dentition in the horse • The secretory output of the salivary glands in a horse • The consequences of acute obstruction of the oesophagus • Factors to consider in the management of the elderly horse Initial presentation • Weight loss • Insufficient intake • Failure to absorb nutrients • Poor nutrient quality • Increased energy demand (illness, neoplasia) • Parasite burden • TPR WNL • Worn incisors – dental examination Misty dental examinationDental “wear and tear” Other images were provided for reference: • ‘Wave mouth’ • Missing teeth • ‘Step mouth’ Management of the older horse with poor dentition • Easy prehension and mastication • Fibre length • Highly digestible • Fibre • Protein • What is “quidding”? Choke in horses • What do most people think of when they hear the term “choke”? • Tracheal obstruction – immediate life- threatening emergency due to asphyxiation • What does “choke” mean in equine veterinary medicine? • Oesophageal obstruction – still a medical emergency, but not immediately life-threatening Why foamy nasal discharge?Passing a nasogastric tube in a horseFlow diagrams • Exercise to demonstrate process/order of events • What event occurs first? • What are the possible consequences of each event? • Why? • Apply deep understanding of anatomy, physiology, pharmacology to predict or explain clinical signs Old pony Poor dentition Inability to masticate feed appropriately Poorly masticated bolus swallowed Large fibrous bolus stuck in oesophagus Physical obstruction of oesophagus Inability of water to reach stomach Saliva/feed pooling in pharynx Dehydration Frothy nasal discharge (epiglottis above soft palate in equids) (external clinical sign) Management: Dental examination and treatment Treatment: Fluid therapy • Oral if obstruction relieved • IV if not yet Management: Provide soft, easily masticated feed Saliva/feed run into trachea by gravity Aspiration pneumonia Treatment: Antibiotics (if indicated) Treatment: Relieve obstruction Loss of saliva (large volumes normally travel to GIT where fluid is reabsorbed) Let’s apply this knowledge in a different context • What if a young cow developed oesophageal obstruction? • For example, swallowed a whole potato that got stuck Young dairy cow Swallowed whole potato Physical obstruction of oesophagus Inability to eructate Gas accumulation in rumen Inability of water to reach stomach Saliva/feed pooling in pharynx Dehydration Frothy nasal/oral discharge (epiglottis not fixed above soft palate) (external clinical sign) Management: Dental examination and treatment Treatment: Fluid therapy • Oral (if obstruction relieved) • IV (if not yet) Management: Chop potatoes Saliva/feed run into trachea by gravity Aspiration pneumonia Treatment: Antibiotics (if indicated) Treatment: Relieve obstruction +/- rumenotomy Distension of rumen (external clinical sign) Occlusion of caudal vena cava Reduced venous return to heart Collapse/death Loss of saliva (large volumes normally travel to GIT where fluid is reabsorbed)","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
