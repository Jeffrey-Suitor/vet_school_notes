You should be able to describe these inputs and outputs for a given system. Inputs • Role of manager is to mix inputs in best way possible to maximise sustainable profit • Range of ways of measuring this, might be $/ha, might be combination of $/ha and a sustainability index, certain KPI, margin or other metric • Key inputs for livestock system include land, animals, labour, pasture and infrastructure Land • As an extensive enterprise land (soil) is the primary building block of the enterprise • Combined with environmental influences (rain/temperature etc) will determine what pasture base is possible • Land can be owned, leased or agisted (both leasing and agisting are generally done under a written agreement or contract) • Can assess likely total stocking rate for an enterprise based on size as stocking rates for particular regions are relatively standard Animals Some enterprises only have one species/breed of animal while others have multiple Pro’s/con’s – spread risk, animal expertise etc Total numbers on property = animals per hectare * total hectares grazed Some enterprises may solely fatten animals while others will have a self replacing breeding flock/herd – this will change the age groups and risk of some diseases Important when collecting “history” about animals to understand the overall farm system Labour • Very important part of successful farm management • Right people plus right knowledge and application • Normally written as FTE (full time equivalent) • Range of disciplines needed on most farms – often contractors involved • Significant training needed, rules/regulations on who can do roles • Contract jobs include shearing, marking, crutching, pregnancy testing, artificial insemination and range of others Workforce • Rural workforce generally older than average workforcePasture management – seed/fertiliser/spray etc • Need suitable quality and quantity of pasture for extensive livestock to meet animal needs over time • In high rainfall zones tend to have higher pasture management costs per hectare, but also run a higher stocking rate e.g. a dairy may harvest 18T grass/ha/yr • Soil type of property will determine amount/type of fertiliser needed • Soil tests to assess needs • Higher pasture production likely to have more regular stock movement • Temperature regions mostly C3 plants, tropical more C4 plants https://biologydictionary.net/c3-c4-cam- plants/ Pasture (cont) • Often integrate livestock with pasture/grain system so paddocks change on yearly basis • Range of herbicides used either in weed control or in pasture establishment • Roundup been highly beneficial in soil conservation/minimum till cropping/planting Farm fencing • Managing livestock requires a farm to be fenced, unless stock are hefted such as in the UK (stock go to same area each year) • Range of fencing types, conventional and electric • Different fence types for different stock e.g. Merino sheep mostly respect a fence, British Sheep breeds less so • Different upkeep for different fence types e.g. monitoring current in electric fence (using a tester, not your hand!) • Future potential for virtual fencing? Farm infrastructure • Different enterprise types require different infrastructure • Dairy farm – needs dairy, silo, yards, landways, small paddock fencing (often electric); regulations around design • Merino – shearing shed, sheep yards, silo, hay shed • 4DVirtualFarms has several examples to consider • Silage storage • Equipment and its storage (tractor, motorbike, SBS) • Laneways for stock movement • Water and power, how water supplied (trough versus dam) Personal transport • Safety! • Motorbikes or side by sides (SBS) • Utility (Ute) • Tractor (ROPS) • Horses • For all above consider EHS (OHS) Feeding infrastructure • Often need to feed stock for limited period of the year • Containment zone (feedlot) • Drought plan • Sell stock • Feed stock • Machinery required to feed – tractor plus grain/roughage feeder • Auger to move grain into and out of silo • Water infrastructure and shade • Hay shed and silos Machinery • Varies based with livestock enterprise • Generally at least a tractor and utility vehicle on farm • In Northern Australian often a small helicopter • Most tractor will have a front end loader • Hay/silage equipment (to make or feed out) • Planting equipment • Grain enterprises may have harvester • Spray equipment • Truck or trailer for livestock movement • Often contractors used for a range of jobs needing specialised equipment such as livestock transport or sowing pasture. Animal health and veterinary • Often regarded as significant costs on farm, albeit usually lower than many other farm costs • We will cover specific health programs under each species • General costs includes vaccinations, internal and external parasite control along with other health preventives/treatments and veterinary assistance for pregnancy testing or health issues Other • A range of other inputs exist on farms with common ones listed here • When doing extramural work it is a great opportunity to consider the variation in what inputs are used for different enterprise types and why • A good question to consider is what would happen if a particular input was not available? What would the impact of that be and would there be other options?","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
