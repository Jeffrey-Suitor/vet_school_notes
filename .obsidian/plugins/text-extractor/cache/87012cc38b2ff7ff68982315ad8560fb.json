THE COMPOUND STOMACH Function is to act as a fermentation chamber where fodder (composed of complex carbohydrates) is broken down into useable metabolites by symbiotic micro-organisms. The relative sizes of the four compartments vary with age, in correlation with the nature of the food ingested. Occupies almost three quarters of the abdominal cavity - fills almost the entire left half of the abdominal cavity in the adult animal, extending from diaphragm to pelvic inlet and extends considerably over the median plane into the right half. It has four compartments which are grouped into: The fore-stomach (or proventriculus) which is non glandular - Rumen Reticulum Omasum The Abomasum which is glandular At birth, the abomasum is the largest compartment; In the adult, the rumen is the largest The reticulum: Is the smallest compartment in cattle Lies on the left side cranial to the rumen The omasum: Is the smallest compartment in sheep Lies on the right side of the rumen and reticulum The abomasum: Is somewhat elongated and lies on the abdominal floor Veterinary Bioscience 1: Digestive system 2 Dyce et al 2002 3 RETICULUM - Alternative term: the honeycomb. Lies on the left side, opposite the 6th to 8th ribs; it is the most cranial compartment. It contributes ~ 5% of total stomach capacity in Ox ( ~ 7-8% in sheep). The reticulum reaches from the cardia to the most forward part of the diaphragm and occupies the full height of this shallower part of the abdomen. It also passes across the midline, especially ventrally, where it lies above the xiphoid process of the sternum. External pressure applied in this position will elicit a pain response in cases of reticulitis (inflammation of the reticulum). External features: o Is somewhat pear-shaped, but is flattened craniocaudally. o Diaphragmatic surface is convex and lies against the diaphragm and liver. o Visceral surface is flattened and lies against the atrium of the rumen. o Dorsally it ends by joining the wall of the rumen. o Ventrally the fundus of the reticulum forms a rounded cul-de-sac that is in contact with the sternal part of the diaphragm, the liver, the omasum and the abomasum. Internal features: o Three openings - Cardia - is the slit like opening of the oesophagus positioned at the junction of the rumen and reticulum and opens into both chambers. Ruminoreticular orifice - wide opening between the rumen and reticulum which communicate over the U-shaped ruminoreticular fold. Reticulo-omasal orifice - round exit into the omasum at the lower end of the reticular groove. o Reticular groove - On the medial wall - extends from the cardia to the reticulo-omasal orifice. The mucosal surface lining the floor of the groove is smooth and pale. o Primary folds (reticular folds) - Reticular mucosa is harsh and usually stained a greenish brown and has a distinctive pattern of ridges about 1cm high - primary folds - which form honeycomb-like structures (four-, five-, and six- sided reticular 'cells'). This honeycomb pattern becomes less regular toward the junction with the rumen and gradually merges with the ruminal surface. There are shorter secondary folds within the cells. Low papillae are present on these primary and secondary folds and on the cell floors. Structure of the wall contains the usual 4 layers of – o Mucosa, o Submucosa, o Muscularis externa and o Serosa Functions: o Serves as a sieve for coarse material o Absorbs fatty acids, water, salts, etc. o Passes coarse material back to the rumen and fine material to the omasum by very forceful contractions. o Heavy materials such as ingested nail or wire lodge in the reticulum - will give rise to traumatic reticulitis ('hardware disease') and can lead to fatal pericarditis. (Banks 1986) 4 The RUMEN (Alternative term: paunch) Getty 1975 Fills the left half of the abdominal cavity extending from the 8th rib to the pelvic inlet. From the abdominal roof to the floor and from the left body wall across the midline, especially caudally and ventrally - Contributes ~80% of total stomach capacity. The dorsal sac of the rumen may be palpated per rectum. Direct contact of the dorsal sac with the upper part of the left flank facilitates auscultation and palpation and easy access for decompression in cases of \"bloat\". External features: compressed laterally and has: o Dorsal curvature - is firmly attached to the sublumbar muscles on the left by peritoneum and connective tissue as far caudal as the 4th lumbar vertebrae. o Ventral curvature - lies on the floor of the abdomen with the superficial wall of the omental bursae between. Has two surfaces: Parietal or left surface: o Is convex o Is related to the diaphragm, the left wall of the abdomen and the spleen The superficial wall of the greater omentum intrudes between the ventral sac of the rumen and the abdominal wall Getty 1975 Getty 1975 5 Visceral or right surface: Related chiefly to the omasum, and abomasum, intestines and liver. Has many grooves which demarcate it into several sacs: o Dorsal sac o Ventral sac o Caudodorsal blind sac o Caudoventral blind sac o Cranial sac o And the insula ruminis - an elliptical area which is not a proper sac External Grooves: o Cranial groove - transverse groove that divides the cranial end of the rumen into the cranial sac (ruminal atrium) and the cranial end of the ventral sac o Rumino-reticular groove - is the line of separation between the ruminal atrium and the reticulum. It is deep ventrally but dorsally the wall of the reticulum and the rumen are continuous and form the dome- like ventricular atrium on which the oesophagus terminates. o Right and Left longitudinal grooves - extend from the cranial to caudal grooves and indicate the division of the rumen into dorsal and ventral sacs. o Right and Left accessory grooves - o The right accessory groove forms a convex curve dorsal to the right longitudinal groove but is joined to it at both ends. The elliptical area on the surface of the rumen that it encloses is referred to as the insula ruminis. o The left accessory groove arises from the middle of the left longitudinal groove and extends caudodorsally and fades out. o Right and Left dorsal coronary grooves - demarcates the caudodorsal blind sac from the dorsal sac o Right and Left ventral coronary grooves o Caudal groove - deep transverse groove that divides the rumen into the caudodorsal and caudoventral blind sacs 6 Internal features: Pillars - internally the grooves correspond to bands of smooth muscle known as pillars. These pillars bear the same name as the grooves: o Cranial pillar - marks off the cranial extremity (ruminal atrium) from the rest of the dorsal sac. Right and left ends extend caudally as the longitudinal pillars o Rumino-reticular fold - U-shaped fold that bounds the rumino-reticular orifice at the cranial end of the ruminal cavity o Ruminal pillars - left and right - encircle the rumen dividing it into dorsal and ventral major sacs o Accessory pillars - right curves around the insula ruminis o Coronary pillars - mark off the caudal blind sacs o Caudal pillar - separates the caudodorsal and caudoventral blind sacs NB: No dorsal demarcation between the rumen and the reticulum - region is termed the ventricular atrium- area where the oesophagus enters the stomach NB: Ruminal atrium is that part of the rumen caudal to the rumino-reticular fold. Rumino-reticular orifice - the opening into the reticulum. After Smallwood 1992 7 Rumen Papillae – The rumen surface is covered with prominent projections known as papillae which vary in height according to age, diet and location. Papillae: Are long and numerous in the ventral and dorsal caudal blind sacs. Fewer and less prominent in the ventral sac. Are short or absent on the roof of the dorsal sac - due to the presence of gas bubbles resulting from fermentation. NB: Volatile fatty acids stimulate development of papillae. Functions of the rumen: o Ruminal contractions mix the ingesta and furthers the process of microbial fermentation releasing volatile fatty acids and gases. o The absorption of volatile fatty acids, sodium, water, etc. o Papillae increase the surface area for absorption and assist mixing of ingesta. o Papillae also serve as heating rods for speeding up the fermentation process. o Rumination and eructation. Banks 1986 Currie 1988 8 The OMASUM (Alternative terms: the book or the butcher's bible). Contributes ~ 7 – 8% of total stomach capacity in the ox. It lies mainly on the right of the midline extending from the 7th to the 11th rib. It is positioned with the rumen and reticulum on its left and the liver and body wall on its right. This is the smallest compartment in the sheep and the goat. External features: o Is spherical to ellipsoidal in shape, but is somewhat compressed laterally. o Has greater and lesser curvatures:  Greater curvature faces dextrocaudally.  Lesser curvature faces levocranially. o Lower pole of the omasum has an extensive attachment to the fundic region of the abomasum around the omaso-abomasal orifice. o Much of the right surface of the omasum is covered by, and is partly connected to, the lesser omentum. Internal features: o Two openings - Reticulo-omasal orifice is at the upper end of the omasal canal. Omaso-abomasal orifice at the lower end of the omasal canal is large and oval and partly obscured by the prolapse of the abomasal folds. o Omasal groove - Runs between the two openings and is in fact the floor of the omasal canal. Mucosa in this region is smooth except for a few low longitudinal ridges. o Omasal laminae - Many parallel folds of four different sizes that fill the omasum. Arise from the sides and greater curvature and project towards the lesser curvature - site of the omasal canal. o Interlaminar recesses - spaces between the folds. o Omasal canal - central area not occupied by folds. o Papillae – The mucosa forms numerous projections or papillae that cover the surface of the laminae. Most are small and somewhat flattened but there are a few large conical projections. Functions: o Absorbs fatty acids, water, salts. o Serves as a two-stage pump for transfer of ingesta from the reticulum to the abomasum. o It is a sieve for quality control separation. Banks 1986 9 The ABOMASUM (Alternative term: 'true stomach'). This is a somewhat elongated sac which chiefly lies on the abdominal floor - partly between the ventral sac of the rumen and the reticulum. The caudal end is flexed around the lower pole of the omasum. Contributes ~ 7-8 % of total stomach capacity in ox. Position and relations of the abomasum depend upon: Age; Pregnancy; The fullness of the different parts of the compound stomach; Intrinsic abomasal activity; and the contractions of the rumen and reticulum to which the abomasum is attached. But there is a limit to normal variation beyond which deviations produce digestive disturbance: Abomasal displacement - left or right - is a well recognised disorder, especially in dairy cows. External features: Are basically similar to the simple stomach (see lecture 9). o The larger cranial pole: Forms a pear-shaped sac equated with the fundus and body of the simple stomach Connected by muscle bundles to the reticulum, ruminal atrium and the ventral sac of the rumen. o The narrower caudal pole: Forms the pyloric region. This passes transversely to the right; Terminates at the pylorus just caudal to the lower part of the omasum Internal features: o Two openings - Omaso-abomasal orifice Pylorus - opens into the duodenum (upper small intestine) o Spiral folds – The dark mucosa of the abomasum is thrown up into many spiral folds that arise around the entrance and course over the walls of the fundus and body, decreasing as they approach the flexure; they serve to increase the mucosal surface area. In the region of the omasal-abomasal orifice these folds help to form a mucosa \"plug\" that limits reflux of ingesta into the omasum. o Torus - The lighter mucosa of pylorus bears a few low rugae but is marked by a large swelling that projects from the lesser curvature to narrow the pyloric passage. The vascular structure of the torus suggests it is capable of engorgement, but its functional significance is unknown. Structure of the wall o Mucosa - is smooth pink and glandular; a thick muscularis mucosa is present o Submucosa o Muscularis externa - smooth muscle thicker inner (circular) and a thin outer (longitudinal) layer. o Serosa is absent from the surface only along the origin of the omentum Functions: Is rich in glands that produce digestive enzymes and HCl for digestion and mucus for protection. Getty 1975 10 GASTRIC GROOVE (Alternative name: oesophageal groove). Function: Serves as a conduit for conveying milk from the oesophagus into the abomasum without having to go through the rumen Consists of three segments - o Reticular groove - From the cardia to the reticulo-omasal orifice Bounded by two prominent muscular folds Passes ventrally on the medial wall of the atrium and reticulum It is open along its left side facing the cavity of the reticulum and rumen Muscular folds roll into a tube when a young animal drinks milk o Omasal groove - From reticulo-omasal orifice to omaso-abomasal orifice on floor of omasum Muscular folds are not very prominent It is open along its right side facing the cavity of the omasum o Abomasal groove - Not a proper groove, just an area without gastric folds It extends along the lesser curvature of the abomasum Blood and nerve supply to the compound stomach Blood Supply - branches of the celiac artery; veins are satellites to the arteries eventually draining into the portal vein. Nerve supply - branches from the dorsal and ventral trunks of the vagus nerve. Dyce et al 2002 11 Comparative aspects: Small ruminants - sheep and goat o Reticulum Is relatively larger (7-8% of total stomach capacity). Contact with the ventral abdominal floor is subject to much variation. o Ventral Sac of Rumen Is relatively larger. Extends more to the right of the midline. o Caudoventral Blind Sac of Rumen Extends more caudally than the dorsal blind sac. o Omasum Is the smallest compartment (~5% of total stomach capacity) o Abomasum Is relatively larger. Due to smaller size of the omasum is usually in direct contact with the liver. Bibliography: Ashdown and Done: Color Atlas of Veterinary Anatomy The Ruminants, 1984.
