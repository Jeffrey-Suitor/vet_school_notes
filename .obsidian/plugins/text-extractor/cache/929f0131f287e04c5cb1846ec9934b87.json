This dog had a vascular liver tumour (haemangiosarcoma) Urinalysis clues • Hyposthenuria (and PU/PD) low urea and reduced medullary tonicity • Bilirubinuria orange urine, bilirubin crystals and positive urine dipstick indicating hyperbilirubinaemia • Ammonium biurate crystals may be seen with PSS, hepatic dysfunction, Dalmatians and Bulldogs Coagulation Disorders • Coagulation abnormalities are common in liver disease • prolonged APTT/PT times • Causes include: • ↓ synthesis of coagulation factors, platelet dysfunction and DIC • cholestasis results in reduced absorption of fat soluble Vit K • Coagulation screening recommended prior to liver FNA/biopsy Bile acids • Produced in the liver from cholesterol and stored in the gall bladder (if present) • Undergo an efficient enterohepatic circulation • released into the intestine • re-absorbed into portal system • extracted by hepatocytes Enterohepatic circulation of bile acids • Following food intake, bile acids are released into the duodenum. • About 95% of the bile acids are reabsorbed in the ileum and are released into the portal vein and redirected to the liver. • Approximately 5% of the bile acids is lost through fecal output. • Only a small portion escapes the enterohepatic circulation and reaches the systemic circulation. Bile acid assay Causes of increased serum bile acids: •Decreased functional hepatic mass (impaired extraction of sBA from the portal blood) •Portosystemic vascular malformations (MVD, PSVA/PSS) portal blood by-passes the liver and thus reduces extraction (esp. post prandially) • Cholestasis (retention and reflux of sBA back into circulation after bile stasis) Bile acid assay • Sensitive and specific test of hepatic function (in the absence of cholestasis) e.g. PSS, steroid hepatopathy, neoplasia • Not useful to assess liver function in animals known to be cholestatic (e.g. hyperbilirubinemia) • Abnormal results do not determine aetiology, severity or prognosis indicates the need for diagnostic imaging, hepatic biopsy Bile acid assay • Single sBA used in horses, camelids • Dynamic sBA used in dogs and cats: – two samples (pre and 2 hours postprandial) – increases sensitivity by challenging the liver capacity for BA extraction after gallbladder contraction • Insensitive test in ruminants Bile acids test protocol • Fast the patient for 12 hours • Collect the first blood sample and label the tube with patient name and “pre” or time zero sample • Feed a small amount (2-4 tablespoons) of canned maintenance-type diet (high-fat diet is NOT necessary) • Two hours after feeding, collect the second sample and label with patient name and “2 hr” • Post-prandial bile acid concentrations >31 umol/L (dogs) are suggestive of hepatobiliary disease Microvascular dysplasia Small breed dogs (Terrier-type) • high sBA may reflect either portosystemic shunt (PSS) or microvascular dysplasia (MVD) • puppies with large shunts often require surgery • whereas MVD is not a surgical problem • ammonia levels may help further evaluate liver function • Protein C values >70% are expected with MVD, whereas a low value would support hepatic insufficiency (e.g. PSS) Ammonia • Ammonia concentration can be useful in further evaluating liver function • produced from exogenous or endogenous amino acids • taken up by the liver where most is converted to urea – urea enters circulation and is then excreted into the urine (and GIT system) • Measurement is problematic as it is very unstable • heparin anticoagulant preferred • separate plasma and analyse ASAP • must be kept chilled Urea cycle https://impower.life/blog/2017/6/30/ammonia-choose-the-wrong-protein-and-you-could-lose-85-or-more-to-ammonia Ammonia • Elevated blood ammonia levels seen with: – Incorrect sample handling – Portosystemic shunt – Hepatic insufficiency (>70% hepatic function lost) – Overgrowth urease-producing bacteria – Urea toxicosis in ruminants Reaching a Final Diagnosis Lab tests help confirm presence of liver disease, but seldom provide an aetiological diagnosis. For this we need: • Ultrasound • Cytology Useful to Dx sepsis, vacuolar change, metastatic neoplasia. Less useful for Dx hepatitis, cirrhosis, hepatocellular tumours • Biopsy for histopathology Often required for a definitive diagnosis as allows evaluation of architecture Hepatic lymphoma: Cytology - malignant neoplasia of intermediate to large lymphocytes (arrow).
