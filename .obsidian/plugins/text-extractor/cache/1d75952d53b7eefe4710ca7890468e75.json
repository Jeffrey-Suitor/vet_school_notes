In which domestic animal species is telangiectasis most commonly seen? • What is meant by the term zonal necrosis of the liver? What is the most common type of zonal necrosis and why? What are some causes of this type of zonal necrosis? • What is meant by the term massive necrosis of the liver? What are causes of massive necrosis? What is the most likely cause of acute massive necrosis in a young pig? • In what circumstances does hepatic fibrosis develop? What is the major source of excess collagen in the liver? • What is the function of hepatic stellate cells in health? Where are they located? • Why are stellate cells so important in progressive hepatic disease? • What is meant by the terms portal (or biliary) fibrosis, centrilobular fibrosis, bridging fibrosis, post-necrotic scarring and diffuse hepatic fibrosis? Which of these patterns of fibrosis are most likely to lead to progressive liver disease and why? • Which cell populations can divide to replace hepatocytes killed by disease processes? • What must be retained in order to ensure efficient hepatic regeneration post-injury? • What is characteristic of the pattern of regenerative hyperplasia of hepatocytes? • What is meant by the term cirrhosis? What gross features are indicative of cirrhosis? What are the potential consequences of cirrhosis? • What causes acquired portosystemic shunting? • How would you distinguish congenital and acquired portosystemic shunting? • What would you expect to see at laparotomy in a dog with acquired portosystemic shunting? Veterinary Bioscience: Metabolism Lecture 9 2 • What clinical signs would you expect to see in an animal with acquired portosystemic shunting?
