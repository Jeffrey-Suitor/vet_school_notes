• Detection of changes in blood volume/pressure by the kidneys • ↓ Na+ in the distal tubule (macula densa) • ↓ pressure in the kidney detected by baroreceptors in the afferent arteriole • Sympathetic stimulation of the juxtaglomerular cells Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) • Renin • Secreted by juxtaglomerular cells in response to: • ↓ Na+ in the distal tubule (macula densa) • ↓ pressure in the kidney detected by baroreceptors in the afferent arteriole • Sympathetic stimulation of the juxtaglomerular cells • Converts angiotensinogen (from liver) to angiotensin I • Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) • Lungs (mainly) • Converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II • Angiotensin II • Potent vasoconstriction, direct effect on kidneys • Preferential vasoconstriction of efferent arterioles in kidney (maintain GFR) • Stimulates release of aldosterone (adrenals) • Aldosterone • ↑ sodium reabsorption Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) • Long term changes in BP, Na+ • Takes ≈20 min to become fully activated (longer for aldosterone) • Angiotensin II only lasts 1-2 min in the circulation • Has a significant, long-lasting effect on BP Guyton & Hall, 14th Ed. 2021 Angiotensin II • Effects at multiple sites: • Proximal tubule to ↑Na+ reabsorption (Na+/H+ exchange) • Constriction of efferent arteriole (maintain GFR) • Systemic constriction of arterioles (↑ peripheral vascular resistance) • Stimulates release aldosterone from adrenal cortex • Effects on brain: • Hypothalamus – stimulates thirst • Posterior pituitary – ADH release • Baroreceptors – prevent response to ↑BP Aldosterone • Na+ reabsorption, K+ secretion • Principal cells in cortical collecting tubule • Production stimulated by RAAS, also by ↑K+ in ECF Other mechanisms of blood volume & pressure maintenance; Na+ excretion/reabsorption • Sympathetic nerves • Strong sympathetic stimulation → vasoconstriction and ↓ GFR • Any degree of stimulation → ↑ Na+ reabsorption • Stimulation of α-adrenoceptors on tubular epithelial cells • ↑ renin and angiotensin II formation Gulati et al., 2016 Other mechanisms of blood volume & pressure maintenance; Na+ excretion/reabsorption • Natriuretic peptides • Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) • Produced by cardiomyocytes in response to stretching of atria when blood volume ↑ • OPPOSES Na+ and water reabsorption • Direct effect in renal tubules – Na+/H+ exchange inhibition • Inhibits renin secretion (therefore whole RAAS) • Dilates afferent arteriole → ↑ GFR vivo.colostate.edu What could possibly go wrong? • Congestive heart failure • RAAS activated when BP decreased • RAAS helpful in the early stages • Blood volume increases to compensate for lack of CO, but heart can’t pump normally, so this becomes detrimental • Too much sodium and water retention • Inhibit ATII production by administering ACE inhibitors Regulation of potassium reabsorption & secretion • K+ main intracellular ion • Tightly regulated in response to dietary intake • Plasma concentrations controlled mainly through reabsorption or secretion in the kidney Regulation of potassium reabsorption & secretion • Reabsorption and secretion happen all along the nephron • Main site of secretion • Cortical collecting tubule • Main site of reabsorption • Inner medullary collecting duct doctorlib.info/physiology/medical/197 Regulation of potassium reabsorption & secretion • Major role aldosterone • K+ secretion, Na+ reabsorption • ATII biggest stimulus for aldosterone release • Plasma K+ concentration also important in aldosterone release • Acidosis • ↓ K+ secretion • Alteration K+ channels, Na+-K+-ATPase • Tubular flow rate • Alters electrochemical gradient • ↑ → ↑ K+ secretion • Intracellular K+ concentration What could possibly go wrong? • 4 year old FN standard poodle • History of vague intermittent signs • Collapsed • Plasma electrolyte concentrations: Electrolyte Value Reference range Sodium (mEq/L) 117 143-150 Potassium (mEq/L) 7.2 4.0-5.0 Chloride (mEq/L) 92 106-114 COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA Copyright Regulations 1969 WARNING This material has been reproduced and communicated to you by or on behalf of the University of Melbourne pursuant to Part VB of the Copyright Act 1968 (the Act).
