I N T E N D E D L E A R N I N G O U T C O M E S At the end of this lecture, you should be able to: - List the different methods available for imaging the gastrointestinal tract. - Identify the abdominal organs on a lateral and ventrodorsal radiograph of the abdomen of a dog. - Recall the radiographic signs of gastrointestinal obstruction.

L E C T U R E O V E R V I E W This seminar will provide an introduction to the different technologies available for imaging the internal organs of the body, including those of the gastrointestinal tract. Each different method provides different information and levels of detail which can be useful when trying to diagnose or assess a particular disease or condition. Understanding some of the principles of how these techniques work will help in the understanding and interpretation of the images that they provide. The normal radiographic anatomy of the abdomen of the dog is discussed followed by some principles of interpretation of the radiographic appearance of the gastrointestinal tract. This is followed by a number of case examples of gastrointestinal obstruction to illustrate these principles. O P T I O N A L F U R T H E R R E A D I N G Thrall, D.E. (ed), (2017).
