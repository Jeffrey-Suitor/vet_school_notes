Muscarinic ACh Receptors Fig. 11.6 Campbell and Reece, Biology 6th Edit, Benjamin Cummings, 2002 G-Protein Coupled Receptors Muscarinic ACh Receptors • 5 different types of MuscR identified and well characterised- all GPCRs • Agents that selectively act at these receptors developed. • M3- ‘smooth muscle/glandular’ – Stimulatory- generates IP3 • M2- ‘cardiac’ – Inhibitory- inhibition of cAMP production – Increased K+ channel opening Signal Transduction Through Muscarinic Receptors Phospholipase CGq GTP Membrane PIP2 IP3 & DAG GIT contraction Secretion M3 (smooth muscle, glands) (Phosphatidylinositol-4,5- bisphosphate) Ca2+ mobilisation PKC activation Signal Transduction Through Muscarinic Receptors Adenylate Cyclase Gi GTP ATPcAMPHeart Rate etc M2 (Cardiac) Muscarinic Receptor Actions When activated will cause: • SLUD – Salivation – Lacrimation – Urination – Defecation • Sweating • Slowing of Heart • Bronchoconstriction • Vasodilatation (NB:non-neural effect) Some Clinical Uses of Cholinoceptor Agonists All selective Muscarinic receptor agonists pilocarpine Glaucoma (in dogs) (cf. neostigmine) carbachol GIT and bladder paralysis bethanecol (care required re: obstruction) Cholinoceptor Antagonists • Muscarinic Antagonists – Blockade of the Parasympathetic NS (parasympatholytics) • Nicotinic Antagonists – Neuromuscular blocking drugs • Non-depolarising • Depolarising – Ganglion blocking drugs Cholinoceptor Antagonists Atropa belladonna Deadly Nightshade Datura stramonium Angels Trumpet/Thorn apple Mainly Atropine (some Hyoscine) Mainly Hyoscine (some Atropine) Muscarinic Antagonists Effects of Atropine etc • Anti-SLUD • Ocular: dilated iris and loss of accommodation • Tachycardia • CNS effects (depending on dose) – agitation, restlessness, disorientation, coma Some Clinical Uses of Anti-Muscarinics • General – Anti-spasmodics (gut/airway smooth muscle) – Ophthalmological use- dilation of pupil permits examination of eye • atropine /(glycopyrrolate) – Reduce secretions and produce bronchodilation (pre-anaesthetic) – AChE-inhibitor poisoning – Bradycardia • hyoscine – Motion sickness • Ipratropium (and others) (inhaled) – Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)/asthma Cholinoceptor Antagonists Curare (d-tubocurarine) Nicotinic Antagonists http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/hebe/hebe_darts Neuromuscular blocking agents • d-tubocurarine – Pre-operative muscle relaxation (artificial ventilation required) – Replaced clinically by ‘better’ agents- e.g. rocuronium etc • Competitive reversible antagonist/ ‘non-depolarising’ blocker – Block reversed with neostigmine • Less effective at autonomic ganglia- but can block at high concentrations • (also ‘depolarising’ blockers- (suxamethonium)- see Twitch Prac!) Toxicology • Many of the agents active on cholinergic NS are natural products or have agricultural uses (insecticides etc) • Danger of poisoning through feedstuff or exposure.
