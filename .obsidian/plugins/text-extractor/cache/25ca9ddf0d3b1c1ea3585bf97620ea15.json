K E Y W O R D S Fluid movement; enterosystemic fluid cycle; plasma volume; electrolyte balance; gastrointestinal tract; mucosal barrier; clinical examination. L E C T U R E O V E R V I E W Saliva, gastric fluid, bile, pancreatic and intestinal fluids are secreted into the digestive tract. The relative volume of these fluids as well as their composition varies considerably between the different species according to diet and type of digestive tract. Much of these fluid secretions are reabsorbed at a more distal part of the digestive tract, exactly where depends on gastrointestinal tract anatomy and physiology. Obstruction to fluid movement along the digestive tract, either physical or functional, can have significant consequences for the fluid balance and circulation of the animal. This lecture looks at common clinical situations in different species where normal fluid movement in the gastrointestinal tract is disturbed. We will examine the clinical consequences for the animal when this occurs, including fluid, electrolyte and acid-base disturbances. We will also look at the different ways of assessing the gastrointestinal tract, particularly in the horse.","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
