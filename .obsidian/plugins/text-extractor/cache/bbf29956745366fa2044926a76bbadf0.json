Do not jump ahead. • This file gives you detailed instructions for completing each activity. Ask your tutor if you have any questions. • For some activities, you will be asked to record your answers to the questions by typing them into this file. You should save this PDF file each time you complete one of these questions, to make sure that your work does not get lost. Guidelines for effective Group work Your group will work at its best when everyone feels comfortable and “safe” to contribute to discussion. Here are a few suggestions that might help promote a safe and effective group work environment: • Ensure that you all know one another’s names- and that you use them during your conversations. • Effective listening is a key to effective group work. Respectful listening enhances a positive group dynamic, and creates a space where it is safe for all to contribute. • Taking time to discuss is really important- discussing involves questioning and responding, reviewing and reflecting, sharing understanding. This is where deep learning occurs. It can often be greatly enhanced by visualisation- by sharing of ideas, summaries and processes on your white board and by collective rephrasing and reframing of ideas. • Sharing of tasks and responsibilities is also important in group work. Perhaps make a roster and each week have a different group member take responsibility for the keyboard, and for completing your interactive pdf. 3 instructions Enter each group member’s name, Iand email address below. After you have completed working through this document, save a copy and follow the instructions at the end of the document to share it with your group via the LMS or email. GROUP NUMBER Name Email Address 4 triGGer You are working at a small animal clinic in Melbourne’s inner east, when Mrs Abrahams brings her cat, a ten year old female neutered Siamese called Suki, in for consultation. “Good” you think as you read the appointment book. “A vaccination, this should be a chance to catch up!” You call Mrs Abrahams in to the consulting room. “Hello Dr Gruca”, she says “I’ve brought Suki in for her shots. She’s actually not due till next month but I’ve noticed recently that she seems a bit skinny, so I thought perhaps you could give her a bit of a check-up.” QUESTION 1 • List the key information about Suki. Key information is all the information that may be relevant in assessing her current condition. • Identify Suki’s main problem and make a list of how it may be caused using a systematic approach. We will call each item on this list a hypothesis. For each hypothesis discuss how it may be causing the identified problem. • What further information, which might be obtained from questioning the owner, will help you decide between your hypotheses? Discuss your reasoning behind each question. 5 history “Has Suki appeared to be unwell?” you ask. “Not really” says Mrs Abrahams. “She’s always been a bit of a fussy eater, but she’s eating just the same as she always has. She’ll only eat the supermarket brand biscuits and fished based tinned food”. “I see her drinking sometimes, particularly after she’s eaten her dry food, but I don’t think that has changed at all”. “One thing that I have noticed though is that she’s vomiting a fair bit. For quite a long time now- maybe since we came last year, she’s vomited maybe once every 2 or 3 weeks, but now she seems to be doing this maybe every 2 or 3 days.” “What about her bowel motions?”, you ask. “Suki’s rather private about that”, she laughs. “We put a cat door in a few years ago- and she always goes outside- we never see her bowel motions”. You check that Suki is up to date with her both vaccinations (F3) and intestinal worming prophylaxis (Felex plus allwormer). You note that her weight when you last saw her 11 months ago was 4.7 kilograms. 6 QUESTION 2 • In the box below, and on the white board, summarize the additional information obtained from the history. • Do you think this is likely to be a serious issue for Suki? • Based upon this information do you think your hypotheses need to be changed? Decide whether each hypothesis is more likely, less likely or can be excluded. Provide an explanation for each change. Give a mechanism in the form of a simple flow chart for any new hypothesis. • What further information that you can obtain from a physical examination may help you refine your hypotheses? Explain how this will help you “rule in” or “rule out” possible causes. 7 physical examination You conduct a physical examination of Suki and record your findings (below). While you are taking Suki’s temperature, she spontaneously loses a large amount of foul smelling faeces. You tell Mrs Abrahams: “Ït looks like we need to add diarrhoea to Suki’s problem list.” Mouth and Dentition Dentition good for a ten year old cat, gums healthy Cardiovascular HR 160 bpm, CRT < 1 second, pulse regular and strong Respiratory NAD Abdominal examination Relaxed abdomen, intestinal loops possibly more distinct Temperature 38.1°C Weight 3.8 kg Body condition score 3/9 QUESTION 3 • Are there any terms that you do not understand? • Summarise the key information that you have obtained by physical examination. • Do you want to add to your list of problems? How would you refine your hypotheses, in the light of the findings of your physical examination? • What diagnostic tests might you order in order to confirm your refined hypotheses? Mrs Abrahams is anxious that these tests might be very expensive, and questions whether they are justified in an older cat. You will need to justify to her how each diagnostic test will help to reach a definitive diagnosis and rule out your current “differentials”. QUIZ 1 Click back to the LMS and attempt Quiz 1 before continuing. 8 clinical investiGation You explain to Mrs Abrahams that there is a number of conditions, particularly in older cats, that could explain Suki’s weight loss. These include renal disease, endocrine problems such as hyperthyroidism and diabetes mellitus, pancreatitis, and a range of gastrointestinal conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and intestinal lymphoma. You explain that it is important to establish a diagnosis, as management of these conditions would be very different. “Alright”, says Mrs Abrahams. “I’m happy for her to have some blood tests and an abdominal ultrasound, but I don’t want her having any operations”. The results of these blood tests and the ultrasound are reported below.

Small intestine Cat mm Dog mm Duodenum <2.5 <5 (dogs <20 kg to 6 (dogs >40 kg) Jejunum <2.5 <4 (dogs <20 kg) to 4.7 (dogs >40kg) Ileum <3.5 <5 Colon <2 Not recorded 10 QUESTION 4 • Using the information you have obtained from your diagnostic tests are you able to reach a definitive diagnosis? • Summarize how the information you have obtained from the history, examination findings and investigation has allowed you to rule out any of your alternative hypotheses and reach this conclusion. • Can you now refine your mechanism for Suki’s presenting signs of weight loss, diarrhoea and vomiting? • Do you think that more clinical investigation will be required to reach a definitive diagnosis? What testing if any would you propose? How would you explain this to Mrs Abrahams, given her initial reluctance for any invasive tests for Suki? QUIZ 2 Read the section on Biopsy technique from “Diagnosis and management of IBD in dogs and cats” Sturgess, In Practice, June 2005, p 297) explaining the advantages of different biopsy techniques. Then, click back to the LMS and attempt Quiz 2 before continuing. 11 clinical investiGation (continued) Two hours later Mrs Abrahams returns to the clinic and you discuss the test results with her. “The blood results are fairly unremarkable. One thing we have found however is that the serum cobalamin is low. This is a vitamin that is only absorbed from a particular part of the small intestine that is called the ileum, so when it is not being adequately absorbed it gives us a clue that there may be a problem in the ileum.” After you have explained the test results to Mrs Abraham she asks “Can you still vaccinate her?” How would you respond? Watch the following video clip which demonstrates how to communicate the initial test results to the client. Suki the Cat Consultation Video 1 The following morning Mrs Abrahams rings with the news that the family have agreed that it is important that they understand fully what Suki’s problem is, and that they want her to have the procedure that has the best chance of reaching a diagnosis. Suki is booked in for an exploratory laparotomy the following day. Surgical report: Laparotomy, with inspection of gastrointestinal tract and collection of full thickness specimens from stomach, duodenum, mid and distal small intestine, colon; also liver and pancreas. Most tissues appear grossly normal, but distal ileum noticeably thickened and ? slight thickening in mid jejunum. Mesenteric lymph nodes draining this region also sampled. Midline incision closed with 2/0 vicryl and 4/0 Vicryl intradermal sutures. 12 Histopathology Examine the photomicrographs of the biopsies and comment on what you observe. You may need to refer to the Digital Slide box to view relevant normal gastrointestinal histology - of normal pancreas (dog), of normal duodenum (horse) and of normal jejunum (horse).

QUIZ 3 Click back to the LMS and attempt Quiz 3 before continuing. 18 Histopathology report: Suki Abrahams Cat Siamese FN 10 yo Stomach: Full thickness biopsy of fundic wall. Gastric glands and underlying lamina propria appear normal. No inflammatory change in submucosal and muscularis layers. Duodenum: Full thickness biopsy. Villi of normal height and circumference. Some inflammatory cells and lymphocytes visible in lamina propria of villi. Deeper layers appear normal. Jejunum: Full thickness biopsy. Infiltrating lymphocytes visible across all layers of the intestinal wall (ie transmural). At higher magnification, epitheliotropic lymphocytes can be seen infiltrating the lamina propria around intestinal crypts. Ileum: Full thickness biopsy. Sample contains mucosa and submucosa- muscularis layers not present. Villi shortened with expansion of the lamina propria by lymphocytic infiltration. Similar cellular infiltration in submucosal tissues. Higher power inspection shows small lymphocytes with uniform chromatin density and shallow nuclear indentations infiltrating the villous epithelium. Intra epithelial lymphocyte nests and plaques are also seen, These are a strong predictor for a diagnosis of intestinal lymphoma. Mesenteric lymph node: The sampled lymph node appeared normal Liver: Wedge biopsy - normal parenchymal architecture with no evidence of lymphocytic infiltration Pancreas: Wedge biopsy - pancreatic acinar cells, ductal tissue of normal appearance. Summary: Histopatholgy consistent with a diagnosis of intestinal T cell lymphoma, involving lymphocytic infiltration of the jejunum and ileum. (Transmural infiltration of jejunum; ileum muscularis layers not presented) 19 QUESTION 6 • Record the relevant findings from the histopathology report below. • You are now in a position to prepare a detailed flow diagram explaining why Suki has presented with vomiting, diarrhoea and weight loss. You may find the following article (and Figure 1 on page 215) useful as you do this: “Diagnostic Algorithm to Differentiate Lymphoma From Inflammation in Feline Small Intestinal Biopsy Samples” by Kiupel et al. 2010 (link in case study module). • What advice would you provide regarding Suki’s future management? What is the physiological basis for this advice? 20 follow up consultation A week later Mrs Abrahams returns with Suki. You share the details of the histopathology report (below) with her. Watch the following video clips which demonstrate both good and bad examples of how to communicate bad news to the client. Suki the Cat Consultation Video 2 Suki the Cat Consultation Video 3 21 closure Following discussion with the family Mrs Abraham tells you that they have decided not to proceed with chemotherapy for Suki. “I think that’s a very reasonable approach,” you assure her. “A recent study reported that 50% of cats with lymphoma survived for twelve months or more. Also T cell lymphoma tends to be less responsive to chemotherapy than B cell lymphoma, because of its slower growth. We can provide some supportive treatment for her, and monitor her condition into the future”. Mrs Abrahams is advised that Suki could be supported by regular injections of Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) to address her problem with absorption of this vitamin from the diseased ileum. In addition, she is advised to feed Suki regular small meals of a highly digestible diet such as Hills a/d. You suggest that she bring Suki back in a month’s time for a check-up. A month later she returns with Suki. Suki’s condition is unchanged, other than further slight weight loss (current weight 3.7 kg). There is no change in the frequency of vomiting and Suki is still able to go outside to defecate most of the time. “How will I know if she is really getting sick?” asks Mrs Abrahams. “I really don’t want her to suffer”. “This condition generally progresses with continued weight loss and inappetance, and typically the vomiting and diarrhoea get worse. Sometimes owners find that they just can’t cope with these signs, particularly if diarrhoeal accidents happen indoors. I suggest that we just keep in touch and we can help you make the decision when the time comes .” You farewell Mrs Abrahams and Suki, agreeing that you will see her again in a month’s time.
