Kept in a large shed, fodder brought to them, mixture of freshly cut grass, silage, grain, straw etc • Discussed more in intensive systems https://www.rabobank.com.au/-/media/rabobank-au/images/insights/dairy- goats.jpg?la=en&h=468&w=700&hash=574E8E993141AC8BDD11F08B8E15FAAC459B7120 Goat nutrition • Similar figures apply to goats, however challenge is parasites • If goats graze at sheep height tend to see increased internal parasite challenges given goats more suited to browse type diet • Goats often used as weed control (some herds used to clean up week issues) • Overgrazing if overstocked • One reason why dairy goats brought into sheds is to manage parasite numbers as this breaks up nematode lifecycle From https://www.nuffieldscholar.org/sites/default/files/reports/2010_AU_Christine-Ferguson_The-Australian-Rangeland-Goat- Management-And-Opportunities.pdf","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
