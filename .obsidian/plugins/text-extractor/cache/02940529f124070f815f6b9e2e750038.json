And why? 85% of mature bodyweight at calving 5 What is the ideal Heifer? 1. Gets in calf quickly as a heifer 2. Calves without problems 3. Produces well 4. Gets back in calf 5. Lots of times 6. Recoups her rearing costs quickly! Heifers that meet their target weights do these things better Google “Heifers on Target” to see the calculator tools There are economic reasons too Production – cows produce 7 litres of milk extra for each 1kg BW at calving Fertility – puberty is related to body weight, so bigger heifers are more fertile at joining Fertility after calving bigger heifers compete better and get in calf quicker Longevity – they last longer in the herd as well There are less calving difficulties How much is 50kg bw worth over 100 heifers? For a heifer calving 50kg heavier than her herd mates there is an increase of 1041 litres of milk, 38.5kg butterfat and 42.5kg protein (81kg MS) over the first three lactations. Depending on the farming system, this equates to an extra $400 to $500 in milk income per heifer. The cost of achieving an extra 50kg liveweight (at 3c per MJ) is likely to be about $70, and the energy cost of producing this extra milk is about $160. $450 – 160 – 70 = $220 / heifer or up to $22,000 8 Ideal heifer benchmarks Ideal heifers (benchmarks): 1. 90% in calf after 6 weeks of joining 2. calve at 22 to 26 months of age 3. 85% to 90% of mature body weight at calving (which will vary with production level) 4. first calver 100 day in calf rate of 60% (year round) or a 6 week in calf rate of 75% 5. production of heifers vs mature cows should be >85% 6. the ratio of second calvers to first calvers should be >85% Ensuring heifers grow well • Weaning to 9 months, nutrition is key – • Diet high in energy and protein • 9 months to joining (15 months) – • Less energy and protein than younger heifers but rising plane of nutrition 10 Source: Dairy Australia 11Google “Heifers on Target” Calves Born Heifers reared Calves weaned Heifers Calve 20- 40% of herd Heifers become cows and lactate Calf to cow cycle 2 years from birth to calving is ideal AEPS – DAIRY WEEK 1 13","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
