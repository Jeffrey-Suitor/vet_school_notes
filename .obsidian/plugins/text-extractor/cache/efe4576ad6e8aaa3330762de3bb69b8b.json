How do we do that? • Stimulate the tissue with a known adrenergic agonist (Noradrenaline) • Repeat the stimulation in the presence of known antagonists at the alpha and beta receptor • Phentolamine- an alpha adrenergic antagonist • Propranolol- a beta adrenergic antagonist • Record any changes in the response in the presence of the antagonist Dilutions…. Why do we do them??? • To “titrate” the volume of drug that we are administering • In a concentration response curve we are typically administering doses across a dose range of 100,000 times : ie from 10-8 – 10-3 • If the concentration is higher, and the dose is very low we can’t measure a small enough volume • If we use a more dilute “stock” solution, the volume for higher doses becomes quite large and will distort the volume and hence concentration in the organ bath So… we performed serial dilutions to dilute our stock solution 10-2 10-3 10-4 10-5 10-6 0.9mL 0.1mL 0.1mL 0.1mL 0.1mL And then we made one:one thousand dilutions of this stock into our organ bath • Stock 1 X 10-5 • Add 25 uL of this stock to a 25 mL organ bath (25,000uL organ bath) • Yields an organ bath concentration of 1 X 10-8 So.. If we wanted an organ bath concentration of 3 X 10-8 …. • We would add three times as much stock • ie 3 X 25uL of stock. • Or 75uL of 1 X 10-5 Or using the equation approach… • C1V1 = C2V2 (Stock) (Bath) • V1 = C2V2/C1 = 1X 10-8 X 25000/ 1X 10-5 =25000 X 1 X 10-3 = 25 uL How do we create a concentration (dose) response curve? • By cumulative additions of noradrenaline to the organ bath • So that we go progressively from a very small concentration of NA in the organ bath (1 X 10-10 M) to a one hundred thousand times higher concentration (1 X 10-5 M) • To achieve these different organ bath concentrations we need to add drug “doses” at different concentrations • So….. we need to understand dilutions Creating a concentration response curve: what do cumulative additions look like? Required concentrations log M* M conc. of NA stock solution Volume of NA added -8.0 1 x 10-8 M (10 nM) 1 X10-5 25 ul -7.5 3.2 x 10-8 M (32 nM) 1 X10-5 55 ul -7.0 1 x 10-7 M (100 nM) 1 X 10-4 17 ul -6.5 3.2 x 10-7 M (320 nM) 1 X 10-4 55 ul -6.0 1 x 10-6 M (1 µM) 1 X 10-3 17 ul -5.5 3.2 x 10-6 M (3.2 µM) 1 X 10-3 55 ul -5.0 1 x 10-5 M (10 µM) 1 X 10-2 17 ul -4.5 3.2 x 10-5 M 1 X 10-2 55 ul 3.2 X 25ul= 80ul but already have 25ul therefore need to add 80-25= 55ul 1 X 10-7 = 10X 10-8 This would require 10X25 ul = 250ul But we already have 80 ul, therefore we need to add 250-80= 170 of 1X 10-5 OR 17ul of 1 X 10-4 Results- what did our charts look like? Time on the X axis Concentration on the X axis Three charts for each tissue: • Noradrenaline (control) • Noradrenaline in presence of alpha antagonist • Noradrenaline in presence of beta antagonist What can we learn from a dose response curve? • Sigmoid “S” shaped concentration response curve • Why is there no increase in response here with further addition of NA? • Why does addition of NA elicit no contractile response here? How many fold difference is there between the first and the last dose administered? LOG NA conc Concentration response curves (CRC) for the Atrial Preparation: Are the adrenoceptors on the Sinoatrial node alpha or beta receptors? • In presence of phentolamine- no change to CRC • In presence of propranolol parallel rightward shift in curve • ie a beta blocker changed the response • This is evidence that the adrenergic receptors on the SA node are beta receptors β ( ) Concentration response curves for the Aortic ring Preparation: Are the adrenoceptors responsible for constriction in the Aorta α or β receptors? • In presence of propranolol- no change to CRC • In presence of phentolamine parallel rightward shift in curve. ( ) • ie an alpha blocker changed the response • This is evidence that the adrenergic receptors responsible for constriction in the aorta are alpha receptors Concentration response curves for the Aortic Ring Preparation: NA induced vasoconstriction in the aorta is mediated through alpha receptors Why is the response to NA in the presence of an alpha blocker restored at higher NA concentrations? But are there beta receptors in blood vessels? Yes, there are, but this setup does not allow us to observe relaxation Thankyou… Resisting the “Call of the Wild”","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
