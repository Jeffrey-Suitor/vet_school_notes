In feedlot cattle, grain overload (ruminal or lactic acidosis) is the most common condition predisposing to hepatic abscess formation. In ruminal (lactic) acidosis, the acid burns the ruminal mucosa, leading to its erosion and ulceration. Luminal bacteria (and/or fungi) may then penetrate the submucosal veins or venules → haematogenous spread to the liver via the portal vein. Ox – multifocal coagulative necrosis of the liver due to embolism of Fusobacterium necrophorum from the rumen following lactic acidosisSheep – multifocal coagulative necrosis due to embolism of Fusobacterium necrophorum from the rumen following lactic acidosis Umbilical infections may occur in any species but are especially common in calves. If bacteria ascend the physiological thrombus in the umbilical vein post-natally, they will lead to multifocal hepatic abscesses. Multifocal (embolic) hepatic coagulative necrosis due to umbilical infection with Fusobacterium necrophorum in a neonatal lamb – neonates will often die in the early stages of embolism of this bacterium due to systemic toxaemia. Chronic hepatic abscesses in a cow – note the thickness of the fibrous capsule (indicated by the markers) and that the pus at the centre is inspissated due to gradual resorption of water and appears grossly caseous Most hepatic abscesses in adult cattle are asymptomatic and will be gradually encapsulated by fibrous tissue and resorbed - multiple chronic hepatic abscesses and overlying capsular fibrosis in a cow A disastrous consequence of an hepatic abscess is erosion into a branch of the hepatic vein and thence the caudal vena cava - suppurative thrombophlebitis of the caudal vena cava due to hepatic abscessation in a cow liver right kidney pus in the caudal vena cava Black disease in a sheepBlack disease in a sheepBlack disease in a sheep (H&E stain) zone of coagulative necrosis blood vessel damaged by clostridial toxins zone of infiltrating leukocytes Sheep liver – bacillary haemoglobinuriaMultifocal (embolic) bacterial hepatitis in a sheep Multifocal (embolic) bacterial hepatitis in a sheepMultifocal (embolic) suppurative bacterial hepatitis in a lambMultifocal (embolic) suppurative bacterial hepatitis in a lambYersinia pseudotuberculosis colonies within a focus of acute embolic hepatitis in a lamb (H&E stain) Toxoplasma gondii bradyzoite cyst (long arrow) and free tachyzoites (short arrow) in the liver of a dog – haematogenous spread of certain protozoal parasites is a potential cause of multifocal hepatitis (H&E stain)Haematogenous spread of viruses can cause multifocal hepatitis - multifocal hepatic and splenic pyogranulomas and excess peritoneal fluid aspirated from a cat with feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) virus infection Multifocal (embolic) hepatitis (multifocal hepatic necrosis) due to haematogenous equine herpesvirus 1 infection in a neonatal foalSinuous haemorrhagic migratory tract of immature Cysticercus tenuicollis in a sheepRecent haemorrhagic migratory tracts of immature cysticerci in the liver of a sheep Parasitic hepatitis in a sheep induced by migration of larval parasites (either immature cysticerci or liver fluke larvae) Multifocal chronic scarring (fibrosis) due to prior parasitic migration through a sheep liver Some parasites may be trapped within the liver by the host inflammatory response – a degenerate and mineralised cysticercus in the liver of a sheep Most larval parasites that wander through the liver parenchyma end up elsewhere. Adult Fasciola hepatica (common liver fluke) end up in the lumina of the bile ducts, as in this cow. Most larval parasites that wander through the liver parenchyma end up elsewhere. Cysticerci of the long-necked bladder tapeworm (Taenia hydatigena) end up forming thin-walled, fluid- filled cysts anywhere in the peritoneal cavity of sheep. Each contains the head and neck of a future tapeworm that can mature in the intestines of a dog that consumes one of these cysts. “Milk spots” due to previous Ascaris suum larval migration through the liver of a pig Larger multifocal scars in a pig liver due to previous migration of Stephanurus dentatus larvaeFibrin exudation over the surface of the liver of a sheep due to simultaneous migration of large numbers of immature liver flukes (acute fascioliasis) Hepatic trauma induced by migrating larval parasites is a potential cause of black disease in herbivores, especially sheep. Zonal Hepatitis Jaundice and oral mucosal haemorrhages in a dog with infectious canine hepatitis (canine adenovirus-1 infection) – a potential cause of zonal (zone 3) hepatitis Multifocal acute haemorrhage over the mesenteries and intestinal serosa of a dog with infectious canine hepatitis – the virus targets vascular endothelial cells → disseminated intravascular coagulation and eventually uncontrolled haemorrhage Swelling and mottling of the liver with fresh fibrin over the capsular surface in a dog with infectious canine hepatitis Mural oedema of the gall bladder in a dog with infectious canine hepatitis Periacinar (zone 3) necrosis in a dog with infectious canine hepatitis (H&E stain)Intra-nuclear viral inclusion bodies in hepatocytes and Kupffer cells in a dog with infectious canine hepatitis (H&E stain) A gross zonal pattern in the liver of a horse with equine serum hepatitis (serum sickness or Theiler’s disease) Diffuse Hepatitis Head-pressing due to hepatic encephalopathy in a Doberman with chronic hepatitis Lymphocyte-rich inflammation of periportal hepatic parenchyma and hepatocyte apoptosis (arrow) in a dog with chronic hepatitis (H&E stain) Hepatocellular apoptosis is a feature of canine chronic hepatitis (H&E stain). Multifocal lymphocyte-rich inflammation of periportal hepatic parenchyma and hepatocyte apoptosis (arrow) in a dog with chronic hepatitis (H&E stain) Cirrhosis due to chronic hepatitis in dogs Chronic Hepatitis in Dogs • idiopathic - most cases • breed- and/or copper-associated • drugs - anti-convulsant therapy - diethylcarbamazine and oxybendazole - idiosyncratic reactions • α-antitrypsin (α1-protease inhibitor) deficiency • infectious agents - canine adenovirus 1, leptospira (rarely) Copper retention in periportal hepatocytes and Kupffer cells secondary to cholestasis in a Doberman with chronic hepatitis (rubeanic acid stain) Breeds affected by chronic hepatic storage of copper include the Doberman pinscher, American (and English) cocker spaniel, Dalmatian, Skye terrier and Labrador retriever. In the first two breeds, copper storage is believed to be secondary to cholestasis. In the Bedlington terrier and West Highland white terrier, hepatic copper storage is believed to be primary and leads to ongoing hepatocellular necrosis/apoptosis and, especially in the Bedlington terrier, cirrhosis. Inflammation of the Biliary Tree Inflammation centred on the extra-hepatic or (arrow) intra-hepatic bile ducts is termed cholangitis (H&E stain). If inflammation centred on the intra-hepatic bile ducts spills over into the periportal (zone 1) hepatic parenchyma (as in this cat with an ascending bacterial infection), it is termed cholangiohepatitis (H&E stain). Inflammation of the gall bladder is referred to as cholecystitis. This is a dog with chronic bacterial cholecystitis – note the thickening of the gall bladder wall due to chronic fibrosis.

Comparable atrophy of the left hepatic lobe can be seen in sheep with chronic fascioliasis (top) but, in the latter condition, dilation of the infested bile ducts is expected to be prominent.
