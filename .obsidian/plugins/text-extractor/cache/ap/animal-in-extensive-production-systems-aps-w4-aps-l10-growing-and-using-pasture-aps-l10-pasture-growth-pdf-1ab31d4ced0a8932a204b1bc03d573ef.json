Stuart Barber Associate Professor srbarber@unimelb.edu.au VETS30030 / VETS90123 Managing pasture • The extensive livestock production manager is essentially a manager of pasture and other supplementary feed inputs • Key driver of extensive livestock = growth and utilisation of pastures to supply livestock needs • Pastures can result in a range of direct and indirect issues that impact on animal health that may then involve veterinarian assistance • Two critical terms • Growth or production of pasture • Utilisation of pasture • Both pasture growth and utilisation must be achieved to get maximum benefit Utilising pasture • Often refer to kgDM/ha of pasture grown/utilised • Not always possible to effectively utilise pasture by livestock at certain times due to high growth rate • Can conserve some pasture as • Hay • Silage • Straw • Standing feed • Percentage consumption of pasture grown might be as low as 20% or as high as 80% (more intensive grazing eg dairy) Plant growth and regrowth • A range of different plants are used, particular differences between temperate and tropical system • Tropical area plants use slightly different metabolic pathways (C4 versus C3) • Examples of C4 plants include kangaroo grass, corn, sorghum etc • Majority of plants used in southern livestock production are C3 Seasonal plant growth https://grdc.com.au/resources-and-publications/grdc-update-papers/tab-content/grdc-update- papers/2018/08/wheat-phenology-and-the-drivers-for-yield-in-the-high-rainfall-zone Plant phases, energy and protein • Energy and protein (and %DM) varies significantly through plant growth phases (and time of year) • Variation within/between paddocks • Aim to maintain pasture in vegetative state as long as feasible (higher energy) Perennial ryegrass grazing example • Common plant in Southern Australia • Along with Phalaris = dominant grass species • Regraze pasture once third leaf almost fully emerged • Allows plant to accumulate root reserves • Maximises pasture harvest https://www.dairyaustralia.com.au/feed-and-nutrition/growing-feed-for-the-herd/growing-pastures/perennial-ryegrass Digestibility • Figures show alfalfa (lucerne) and grass examples (also with subclover) • Smaller mouthed livestock able to be more discriminatory • Cows not able to be as discriminatory • Now have a look at some images from Dookie through time https://www.hzn.com.au/pasture_digestibility_estimates.php","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
