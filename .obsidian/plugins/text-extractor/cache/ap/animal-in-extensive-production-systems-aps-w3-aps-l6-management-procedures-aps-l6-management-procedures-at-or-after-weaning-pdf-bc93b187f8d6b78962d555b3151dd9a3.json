Similar raddle used for rams when mating sometimes.Dry raddle Ageing stock • Checking stock to see if will be retained – check ear tag colour but also teeth • 8 teeth = full mouth, table shows adult incisor teeth • Deer not routinely aged by teeth • Alpaca have 3 sets of incisors, first erupt at 2 years, then 3 years and third at 3-6 years Species 2 teeth 4 teeth 6 teeth 8 teeth Cattle 24 months 36 months 48 months 60 months Sheep 12-18 months 24 months 36 months 48 months Goats 12 months 24 months 36 months 48 months Male reproductive examination Generally performed a few months prior to when due to be mated Also frequently done on young males at weaning in stud enterprises to see if capable of being used for breeding At minimum usually examines testicles, penis and prepuce, feet/legs (ability to walk), condition score & lastly teeth and eyes. Role of male in extensive livestock is to be capable of successfully inseminating a certain number of females – needs all these areas to achieve this Post weaning process • Young animals often educated to novel feeds at weaning time (ideally already trained pre weaning) • Managing in yards enhancing any future intensive feeding as already used to it • Train to dogs/noises etc and novel feedstuff they may experience • Feedlots prefer animals that have already experienced this environment Management of feet • Range of soil type and climate – impacts feet growth and wear • May require intervention to manage feet (although better if can be managed by genetics/environment) • Disease often requires increased foot management e.g. footrot • Range of devices to trim feet, also options for foot bathing Fibre maintenance Maintenance of wool/fibre on small ruminants will be covered in week 9-12 however is important on 6-12 month basis (varies according to demand for certain fibre length and growth rate on different breeds) Main wool removal = shearing Shearing around breech area removed during crutching (commonly a few months prior to shearing) – reduces fly risk Shearing sheds in Australia for this but in other countries may be done outside Powered handpiece used for shearing (historically blade shearing) Regular yearly livestock activities Vaccination Drenching Feeding stock (we cover this next week), comes back to weighing stock and condition score and pasture assessment/management Joining (mating) Removing males","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
