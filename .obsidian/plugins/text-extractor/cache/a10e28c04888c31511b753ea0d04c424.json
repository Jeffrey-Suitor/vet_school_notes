Vascular smooth muscle cells: overview • Three types of muscle in the body: skeletal, cardiac and smooth • Vascular smooth muscle cells present in the tunica media of (some) blood vessels • Changes in their contractile tension (tone) constrict and dilate vessels Vascular smooth muscle cells: overview • Spindle shaped cells wrapped around vessels • Overlapping actin-myosin filaments are the contractile units • Thin filament (actin) is longer  enables greater shortening (cf. cardiac) • Poorly developed sarcoplasmic reticulum  rely primarily on diffusion of Ca2+ ions from ECF to initiate contraction Vascular smooth muscle cells: overview • Actin filaments anchored to dense bodies (instead of Z disks) in cytoplasm and dense bands in cell membrane • Not aligned across the cell no striations • Appear to ‘wrinkle’ on contraction dense bandactin filaments Vascular smooth muscle contraction • Contraction triggered by a rise in intracellular [Ca2+ ] • Most of the increase in [Ca2+ ] arises from influx of extracellular calcium; relatively small contribution from intracellular stores Two broad groups of excitation-contraction coupling: 1. Electromechanical coupling: depolarisation of the VSM cell  opening of L-type voltage gated calcium channels 2. Pharmacomechanical coupling: Binding of signalling molecule to a receptor leads to increase in intracellular [Ca2+]; either via G- protein coupled release of intracellular stores or opening of receptor-operated calcium channels (no change in membrane potential) Vascular smooth muscle contraction • Contraction triggered by a rise in intracellular [Ca2+ ] Depolarisation of L- type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels Ligand-gated Ca2+ channels G-protein coupled receptors SR Ca2+ store [Ca2+] Vascular smooth muscle contraction • Contraction triggered by a rise in intracellular [Ca2+ ] Depolarisation of L- type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels Ligand-gated Ca2+ channels G-protein coupled receptors SR Ca2+ store [Ca2+] electromechanical pharmacomechanical Increase in [Ca2+]i Ca2+ + calmodulin complex [Ca - calmodulin] - Myosin Light Chain Kinase Phosphorylation of Myosin Light Chains Mysoin forms a crossbridge with actin Vascular smooth muscle contraction Contraction of Smooth Muscle Cells Example: Amlodipine Ca2+ channel blocker  causes VSM relaxation What is different about vascular smooth muscle? • Contracts slowly, maintains tone for long periods of time • Low energy requirements (low ATP utilisation) • Poorly developed sarcoplasmic reticulum • Cell to cell conduction via gap junctions (as for cardiac muscle) • No troponin, no voltage operated Na channels Vascular tone • Vascular tone is the state of contractile tension in vessel walls • Basal vascular tone produced by vascular smooth muscle contraction sustained continually  this maintains arterial blood pressure •  tone (relative to basal) = vasoconstriction,  tone = vasodilation • Can be maintained by spontaneous depolarisation • Changes in tone modify resistance and therefore flow • A number of factors modify this tone  fine control of tone BASALVASOCONSTRICTION VASODILATION Factors controlling vascular tone 1. Intrinsic mechanisms – Regulation by factors entirely within the vasculature  Myogenic response  Vasoactive metabolites  Endothelial secretions Intrinsic mechanisms are responsible for autoregulation, active and reactive hyperaemia 2. Extrinsic mechanisms – Regulation by factors outside the vasculature  Neural control (vasomotor nerves)  Hormonal control (vasoactive hormones) Extrinsic mechanisms can override intrinsic mechanisms to meet the needs of the whole animal 13 Myogenic response • Vascular smooth muscle contracts in response to stretch and relaxes with a reduction in tension • Important because: • Contributes to basal tone • Stabilises tissue blood flow if arterial pressure changes • Particularly prominent mechanism in cerebral, coronary and renal arterioles. Myogenic response Change in diameter of rat cerebral artery upon raising intraluminal pressure (P) Initial passive stretch followed by active contraction Mediated by depolarisation and Ca2+ Depolarisation initiated by stretch-activated channels; Response sustained by tension sensitive channels Vasoactive metabolites 16 • Metabolic products released into interstitial fluid cause alterations in local blood flow • Function to match blood flow to metabolic demands of tissue • Vasoactive metabolites contribute to metabolic (active) hyperaemia and reactive hyperaemia Metabolic (active) hyperaemia • Increased blood flow in response to  metabolic rate Examples: • CO2, • Lactate, • Adenosine • K+ Reactive hyperaemia • Temporary  blood flow following a period of reduced blood flow • Leads to rapid restoration of O2 supply and ‘wash out’ of accumulated waste products Reactive hyperaemia • Blood flow stopped by clamping the femoral artery (dog) for 15, 30, 60 seconds • Release after 60s resulted in peak blood flow 70% greater than control flow, return to normal after around 2 mins • Peak flow and duration of hyperaemia proportional to duration of occlusion Factors controlling vascular tone 1.

Sympathetic nerves – predominantly vasoconstrictor 2. Parasympathetic nerves – vasodilator • ‘vasoconstrictor’ and ‘vasodilator’ refer to the effect of an increase in nerve activity Remember that:  a reduction in vasoconstrictor activity can cause vasodilation Sympathetic vasoconstrictor nerves • Post ganglionic sympathetic fibres terminate in the outer border of the tunica media • Fibres release vesicles containing noradrenaline (NA) • NA activates α- adrenoreceptors causing vasoconstriction Sympathetic nerve NA α1,2 contraction • Arterioles (all organs) • Veins (abdominal organs) Increased sympathetic activity: •Increases peripheral resistance (TPR) •Reduces local blood flow •Displacement of blood from peripheral to central veins α-adrenoceptor-mediated constriction of smooth muscle NA • G protein activates PLC • Cleaves membrane phospholipid to produce IP3 • IP3 opens Ca2+ channels on the SR Parasympathetic vasodilator nerves 34 • Parasympathetic fibres release vesicles containing acetylcholine (ACh) • ACh activates M3 muscarinic receptors on ECs  synthesis of NO dilation Parasympathetic nerve ACh M3 Dilation • Coronary arterioles • Genital arterioles • Salivary gland arterioles Hormonal control 35 A number of hormones contribute to regulation of vascular tone: • Adrenaline • Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) • Angiotensin • Insulin • Thyroxine • Oestrogen Also other signalling molecules (paracrine and autocrine) such as: • Serotonin • Histamine • Bradykinin • Thromboxane Adrenaline Adrenaline and noradrenaline (NA) Adrenaline α1 & α2 receptorβ2 receptor β2 receptors predominate in the coronary circulation and skeletal muscle α receptors predominate in most tissues ADRENALINE/NA ADRENALINE/NA Unlinke α adrenoreceptors, β2 receptors are not innervated by sympathetic nerves  they respond to circulating adrenaline and NA Extrinsic control can override intrinsic control: haemorrhageExtrinsic control can override intrinsic control: haemorrhage 39 Atrial baroreceptor & volume receptor Sympathetic activation Increased TPR Reduced local blood flow AND Contraction of veins  displacement of blood to central veins Partial restoration of cardiac filling pressure Overview of vascular control 40 Summary • Vascular smooth muscle cells » Structure » Excitation –contraction coupling • Factors controlling vascular tone o Intrinsic  myogenic response  vasoactive metabolites  endothelial secretions o Extrinsic  neural control (vasomotor nerves)  hormonal control (vasoactive hormones)","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
