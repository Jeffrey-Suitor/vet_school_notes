Lecture 1: Intended learning outcomes Why have a cardiovascular system? • The cardiovascular system is an elaborate transport network that distributes materials that are essential for the survival of body cells • Plays a critical role in the exchange of molecules – delivery of substrates (e.g. oxygen and glucose) the tissues, and the removal of metabolic waste products from the tissues • Distribution of messengers such as hormones to the tissues, also distribution of body defence mechanisms (immune cells) • Role in temperature regulation → distribution of heat from the core of the body to the skin Cardiovascular System • The heart - the driving force propels blood around the body • Arterial system the distribution channels • The microcirculation the exchange vessels • The venous system the blood reservoirs, return blood to the heart Cardiovascular System • The heart - the driving force propels blood around the body • Arterial system the distribution channels • The microcirculation the exchange vessels • The venous system the blood reservoirs, return blood to the heart Body fluid compartments: overview Hall, 2016 Interstitial fluid Plasma Extracellular fluid Intracellular fluid Lymph Transcellular fluid (ef. CSF, synovial fluid) Body fluid compartments: ECF and ICF • Total body water (TBW) Ill 60% of lean body weight • 1/3 of TBW is extracellular  ¼ extracellular water = plasma  ¾ extracellular water = interstitial  Exchange of water, solutes, nutrients and gases occurs via diffusion and osmosis driven by hydrostatic and oncotic pressures • 2/3 of TBW is intracellular  Water, solutes, nutrients and gases must cross the cell membrane  Simple diffusion and osmosis occurs for some molecules  Additional transport mechanisms are required for others – next lecture 1/3 2/3 1/4 3/4 Guyton & Hall, 2007 70kg dog Capillaries: sites of exchange • Exchange of fluid (nutrients & metabolic products) between blood and interstitial fluid • Capillary walls are made up of a single layer of endothelial cells (~2μmthick) • Capillaries are located close to every cell in body (30-100µm distance) → reduced diffusion distance = ↑ rate of diffusion (Fick’s law) Boron & Boulpaep, 2012 Movement of substances across capillary walls 1. Diffusion • Lipid-soluble molecules cross EC membranes • Lipid-insoluble molecules pass between ECs and through pores • Rate of diffusion described by Fick’s Law 2. Transcytosis or pinocytosis 3. Bulk flow via Starling’s Forces – driving force • Bulk flow of fluid through channels in capillary wall – molecules moving together in bulk Modified from Rhoades & Pflanzer 2003 Water channel or pore • Movement of macromolecules across ECs in vesicles Fick’s equation Fick’s equation describes factors that influence the rate of net diffusion across a membrane: 1. Magnitude of concentration gradient  Greater the difference in concentration, faster the rate of net diffusion 2. Permeability of the membrane to the substance  Greater the permeability, faster the rate of net diffusion 3. Surface area of membrane available for diffusion  Larger the surface area, faster the rate of net diffusion 4. Molecular weight of substance  Heavier the molecule, the slower the rate of net diffusion 5. Distance of diffusion  Greater the distance, the slower the rate of net diffusion Guyton & Hall, 2007 NFP = (Pc + ∏if) – (Pif + ∏p) Filtration forces Absorption forces Forces influencing bulk flow: Starling’s forces Four forces influencing bulk flow: 1. Capillary blood pressure: hydrostatic pressure exerted on the capillary wall by the blood. Forces fluid out of capillary 2. Plasma colloid osmotic pressure (also known as oncotic pressure): force caused by plasma proteins which remain in plasma, which exerts an osmotic effect on water. Forces fluid into the plasma compartment 3. Interstitial fluid pressure: hydrostatic pressure exerted by the interstitial fluid on the outside of the capillary wall. Forces fluid into capillaries. 4. Interstitial fluid colloid osmotic pressure: the protein concentration in the interstitium is normally very low, and so this force is close to zero. Filtration is greatest at the arterial end of the capillary • Hydrostatic forces favouring filtration are greatest at the arterial ends of capillaries • Oncotic osmotic pressure predominates at the venous ends of the capillaries ensuring 90% of the fluid is reabsorbed → this creates a filtration- absorption imbalance • This excess fluid is collected by the lymphatic system Rhoades & Pflanzer, 2003 Cardiovascular System • The heart - the driving force propels blood around the body • Arterial system the distribution channels • The microcirculation the exchange vessels • The venous system the blood reservoirs, return blood to the heart Single and dual circulatory systems Single circuits: Advantage: Blood passing through the gills is fully oxygenated when it moves into the tissues. Limitation: In passing through the gills, blood loses much of its pressure developed by contraction of the heart. This limits rate of oxygen delivery to the rest of the body. Dual circuits: Effectively two heart pumps and two circulations Flow must be matched in the two circulations More efficient, higher rate of oxygen supply to tissues Dual circulation • The LEFT side of the heart pumps OXYGENATED blood to the SYSTEMIC circulation • The RIGHT side of the heart pumps DEOXYGENATED blood to the PULMONARY circulation • Two separate vascular loops – both originate and terminate at the heart Blood flows in one direction! Right ventricle ↓ ← Right atrium ↑ Pulmonary arteries Systemic veins ↓ ↑ Lungs Capillary beds ↓ ↑ Pulmonary veins Systemic arteries ↑ ↑ Left atrium → Left ventricle • Flow througha tube requires a pressure difference → fluid flows from high to low pressure • Friction against blood vessels resists flow through blood vessels (tubes) • Force required to move a given volume of fluid through the tubes (in a specified period of time) is the vascular resistance How does blood flow? HIGH pressure LOW pressure Therefore, flow can be modified by:  Changing pressure difference or  Changing vascular resistance The basic flow equation The basic flow equation: Q = flow rate; ΔP = Pressure difference; and R = resistance or Q = ΔP R Flow = Pressure difference Resistance As the difference in pressure between the two ends of the vessel increases, flow rate increases proportionately Note: flow rate is not determined by the absolute pressures Determinants of resistance (classical Hagen-Poiseuille equation) Key message: Resistance is inversely proportional to the radius of the vessel Therefore, as vessel radius decreases, resistance increases Poiseuille’s Law 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 𝑄𝑄 = ∆𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑟𝑟4 8𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 𝑄𝑄 = ∆𝑃𝑃 𝑅𝑅 Basic flow equation Inserting the determinants of resistance This is called Poiseuille’s Law 𝑅𝑅𝑟𝑟𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑟𝑟 𝑅𝑅 = 8𝑥𝑥 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 𝑥𝑥 𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑙𝑙𝑣𝑣 𝜋𝜋(𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑣𝑣𝑟𝑟𝑣𝑣)4 = 8𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 𝜋𝜋𝑟𝑟4 Resistance in networks of vessels Blood vessels are arranged in series and in parallel Resistance in networks of vessels: Series Total resistance (RT) = R1 + R2 + R3… Resistance in networks of vessels: Parallel Total resistance for vessels in parallel: 1/RT = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3… (this is called Ohm’s law) Resistance in networks of vessels Key concepts: • Total resistance in a series of blood vessels is equal to the sum of individual resistances of each segment • Greatest pressure drop will occur in the segment with greatest resistance • Vascular beds in organs often arranged in parallel • In a parallel network, total resistance is lower than resistance in individual segments Cardiovascular System • The heart - the driving force propels blood around the body • Arterial system the distribution channels • The microcirculation the exchange vessels • The venous system the blood reservoirs, return blood to the heart The pumping system: role of the heart • The heart consists of two muscular pumps • Blood flow through organs is passive • Right heart pump provides energy to push blood through pulmonary vessels • Left heart pump provides energy to push blood through the systemic organs The pumping system: role of the heart • Each side consists of two chambers: an atrium and a ventricle • Heart valves allow flow of blood in one direction only • Systole is the phase of the cardiac cycle when the muscle cells are contracting • Diastole is the phase where muscle cells relax • The left and right pumps are arranged in series Pathway of blood flow through the heartCoordinated pumping of the heart • Efficient pumping requires coordinated contraction of cardiac muscle cells • Contraction is triggered when an action potential sweeps over the cell membrane • Coordination is achieved primarily by conduction of action potentials between cells via gap junctions that connect cells https://www.78stepshealth.us/human-physiology/cardiac-and-smooth-muscles.html Coordinated pumping of the heart • The heart has a specialised conduction system • Sinoatrial node (SA) node is the pacemaker – it initiates the action potential • Conduction system ensures that all of the cells work together to produce efficient pumping of the heart Coordinated pumping of the heart Effective cardiac pumping requires: • Regular, synchronised contractions • Valves that open and close normally (no leakes) • Adequate force of muscle contraction • Adequate filling of ventricles …… or there will be adverse consequences – stay tuned for the next chapter of this story!
