Hinchcliff Faculty of Veterinary and Agricultural Sciences, And Trinity College, University of Melbourne August, 2023 Intended Learning Outcomes • Understand the major cardiovascular responses to stress, using exercise as an example. • Describe the cardiovascular responses that occur at the onset of heavy exercise, particularly, in qualitative terms: – Changes in cardiac output and relationship with rate of oxygen consumption – Changes in mean systemic arterial pressure – Effect on ventricular filling pressures (both left and right) – Changes in sympathetic and parasympathetic activity • Explain the mechanisms underlying the increase in cardiac output during exercise • Explain the effects of repetitive exercise (ie training) on: – Resting heart rate – Maximal cardiac output during exercise Cardiovascular system • Purpose/role (esp. during exercise): – Delivery of nutrients to organs and systems • Oxygen, glucose, electrolytes – Removal of products of metabolism • CO2, urea – Thermoregulation • convective movement of “heat” from site of production to the skin • Ultimately, capacity of the cardiovascular system is determined by cardiac output.• Votion, Rivero and Piercy Equine Sports Medicine and Surgery 2013 and 2022 Maximal oxygen consumptionWhat determines oxygen delivery? VO2 = Q x (Ca – Cv) • Where VO2 is the rate of oxygen consumption (usually mls/kg/min or L/min) • Q is the cardiac output (L/min) • Ca is the content of oxygen in the arterial blood (mL of oxygen per 100 mL of blood) • Cv is the content of oxygen in the venous blood (mL of oxygen per 100 mL of blood) How can oxygen delivery be increased?• Increase cardiac output (next slide) • Increase Ca – Increase haemoglobin (Hb) concentration in blood – Horses – splenic contraction. Not humans! • Decrease Cv – Increased oxygen extraction, Bohr effect Running speed Determinants of cardiac output Q = HR x SV Q = cardiac output (L/min) HR = heart rate (beats/min) SV = stroke volume (L/beat) Heart rate responses to exercise - horses Evans and Rose 1986 Heart rate and VO2 Remote sensing and biometry Heart rate meters and telemetric ECG Stroke volume SV = EDV – ESV • EDV = end diastolic volume (L or ml) • ESV = end systolic volume (L or ml) Concept – SV is the volume of blood in the heart at the end of the filling phase (diastole), minus volume at the end of the emptying phase (systole) – the volume of blood pumped per beat Or, SV = EDV x EF • Where, EF = ejection fraction (< 1.0) Effect of exercise on stroke volume • SV in horses increases from ~0.8 L/beat (cardiac output of 25-30 L/min) to ~1.5 to 2.0 L/beat (cardiac output of 300 – 400 L/min) during intense exercise • How: – Increased end-diastolic volume – Decreased end-systolic volume – (increased ejection fraction) Summary • Increased cardiac output during exercise is due to: – ↑ heart rate • ↑ Sympathetic tone, ↓ parasympathetic tone – Stroke volume • ↑ Preload • ↓Afterload • ↑ Contractility Vascular pressures of horses during exercise Poole DC and Erickson HH. Equine Sports Medicine and Surgery 2014Poole DC and Erickson HH. Equine Sports Medicine and Surgery 2004/2013 Blood flow distribution • Where is the blood needed most? • Less so (relatively); – Splanchnic viscera (eg intestines) – Kidneys – Initially skin (with subsequent vasodilation) • More so: – Muscles – Skin (for thermoregulation) Blood flow distribution Equine Sports Medicine and Surgery Thermoregulation image Takahashi Y, Ohmura H, Mukai K, Shiose T, Takahashi T.
