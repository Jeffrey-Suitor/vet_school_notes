M. zygomaticus, 2. M. buccinator 3. M. depressor labii inferioris Sheep head- lateral aspect Much of the sub- cutaneous fat has now been removed to reveal underlying structures Note the shiny brown cut surface of the parotid lymph node - this lies rostral to the parotid salivary gland and is relatively large in sheep compared to other species. Sheep head- lateral aspect Sheep head- lateral aspect In this specimen the salivary glands can be more clearly seen. Mandibular salivary gland is ventral to parotid gland and caudo medial to the mandible The parotid duct extends from the parotid gland across the lateral aspect of Masseter m. to open into the oral vestibule opposite the upper cheek teeth Sheep tongue – ventral aspect This tongue has been elevated and the mucosa connecting it to the oral cavity floor transected. In ruminants the sublingual gland has a compact monostomatic part and a diffuse polystomatic part The monostomatic part (shown here) lies rostral to the polystomatic part (cf. the dog – see later) and its duct opens at the sublingual caruncle. The polystomatic part has multiple ducts that open into the oral cavity on either side of the frenulum. Sublingual caruncle -ruminants Ox (preserved specimen) Sheep – the probe has been inserted into the right caruncle In ruminants the caruncle is caudal to the incisors.Sheep tongue and mandible - dorsal aspect Black arrows: Sublingual caruncles Note the conical buccal papillae lining the cheeks. Numerous fungiform papillae can be seen scattered amongst the filiform papillae on the apex and body of the tongue - and also on lateral aspect of torus. Sheep – dorsal wall of oral cavity. Note the caudal facing folds or rugae of the mucosa of rostral part of the hard palate Sheep head- medial aspect: Tongue Genioglossus m. is one of the extrinsic muscles of the tongue – i.e. originates outside the tongue and inserts into the tongue Sheep head - ventral aspect: muscles * * The straps of geniohyoideus m. can be seen deep to the thin mylohyoideus m. -see previous slide. Sheep head- medial aspect: Pharynx Oesophagus NP=nasopharynx, OP=oropharynx, LP=laryngopharynx Dog head – skin and superficial muscles removed. 1. temporalis m. 2. masseter m. 3. buccinator m. 4. parotid salivary gland 5. mandibular salivary gland 6. jugular vein, black arrow: parotid duct, blue arrows: branches of facial N. Dog head - lateral aspect Dog head - lateral aspect Note the orientation of the fibres in this part of the Buccinator m. -described as ‘herringbone’ Facilitates squeezing action of cheek when muscle contracts to move food from vestibule back into oral cavity proper Dog head - lateral aspect The mandibular gland (M) and compact monostomatic part of sublingual gland (S) are located within a common capsule. This has been incised and reflected and the glands pulled caudally to expose the sublingual gland that extends between masseter and digastricus to lie medial to the mandible at its rostral end. 1.maxillary v. 2. linguofacial v. 3. Lingual v. 4. Facial v. Dog head - lateral aspect The parotid duct exits the gland and in the dog crosses the lateral aspect of the masseter (is palpable in the live animal). It opens into the oral vestibule via a small papilla opposite the upper 4th premolar (carnassial) tooth. Dog head - lateral aspect The mandibular(M)and sublingual (S) glands have been reflected to reveal their medial surfaces. The black arrow indicates the the mandibular duct. The duct of the monostomatic part of the sublingual gland runs alongside this duct. Together they run between the genioglossus and mylohyoideus muscles ventral to the tongue to open at the sublingual caruncle. The sublingual caruncle in the dog is located lateral to the rostral end of the frenulum. The lobules of the polystomatic part of sublingual gland lie deep to the mucosa on either side of the body of the tongue and open into the oral cavity via several ducts. Dog head - ventral aspect Mylohyoideus m. is ventral to Geniohyoideus m. It has transverse fibres extending between the mandibles and also inserts on the basihyoid bone caudally NB Geniohyoideus and mylohyoideus act indirectly on the tongue, but do not insert into it – so are not extrinsic muscles of the tongue Dog head – lateral aspect The mandibular(M) and sublingual (S) salivary glands have been reflected dorsally and superficial veins removed to expose the Digastricus muscle. In the dog a tendinous intersection (t) divides this muscle into rostral and caudal bellies. The blue arrow indicates The large Hypoglossal N. Dog head - ventral aspect The mylohyoideus m. has been transected along its attachment to the left mandible and The mandibles separated at the symphysis to expose the extrinsic muscles of the tongue: Genioglossus (from chin) Styloglossus and Hyoglossus (both from hyoid apparatus). Dog head - ventral aspect The sublingual caruncles in the dog are on either side of the base of the rostral frenulum (blue arrow). Note the fibres of genioglossus muscle within the frenulum Dog - Hyoid apparatus The root of the tongue is attached to the transversely oriented basihyoid bone. The styloglossus muscle originates from the stylohyoid bone, the hyoglossus muscle from the basihyoid and thyrohyoid bones (the latter indicated by the dashed line as it is covered by muscle here). L=larynx, T=trachea Horse – Larynx, Oropharynx, Hyoid apparatus The hyoid apparatus is a set of bones that is attached to the skull and suspends the larynx and the tongue. The root of the tongue is attached to the basihyoid bone. The wall of the pharynx has been transected along one side and reflected to expose the larynx. The pharyngeal muscles are deep to the mucosa. Konig and Liebich 4th Ed.Pig and horse: lingual body, ox: torus Tongue papillae Ox tongue – lateral aspect of torus. Note the mix of lentiform/ lenticular papillae and conical papillae on the dorsum of the tongue Tongue papillae Horse - the vallate papillae are located at the junction of the root and body of the tongue Sheep tongue -dorsal aspectSheep tongue - torus linguae Note the location of the mechanical papillae- conical and lentiform - on the dorsum of the torus, with the vallate papillae (gustatory) located on the caudal and lateral parts of the torus","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
