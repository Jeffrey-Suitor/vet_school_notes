Evolution of the horse About 150 million years ago: • Hyracotherium “goat-like” 1m tall odd toed ungulate • Climate change caused a shift from rainforest (which covered most of the Earth) to large patches of open savannah grassland • Since leafy food became scarce, had to adapt to new food source (grass) and lifestyle • Required need for serious speed – i.e. flight! Drivers for horse evolution • Need for greater speed and body size to escape predators – long limbs, strong backs • Cooling climate during Cenozoic replaced forests with grasslands. Large powerful jaws and teeth. • Simple hooves and elongated legs adapted for speed in open (exposed) plains Consequences of evolutionary adaptation • Flight animals capable of serious speed (and momentum) • Vulnerability to injury • Preventative measures vital: • Require safe robust fencing and calm environment • Avoid environments where sudden changes in noise, movement and wind are likely! • Vulnerability to catastrophic fractures • Huge forces on limb bones at top speed • Modelling/remodelling of bone with exercise Barbaro Adaptations for grazing • Hypsodont type teeth for grazing • Cheek teeth with bands of enamel and less hard cementum and dentine on the crown • Open tooth roots permitting continuous eruption • Larger teeth and larger skull to hold them Problems with cheek teeth • Difficult to examine properly • May develop sharp edges or hooks, especially if receiving insufficient forage • Edges/hooks may require ‘floating’ (filing) every 6 months or so • Waves or steps in the cheek teeth arcades cause a significant problem for breakdown of long stems of forage • Insufficient grinding of forage may be associated with choke or reduced forage digestion/utilisation Equine digestive tract • Simple stomach designed for small frequent meals • Large sacculated hindgut adapted to fibre digestion • Horses adapted to graze – with good quality fibre a critical element to digestive health Horses are hindgut fermenters • Adapted to grazing of pasture through most of the day • NOT adapted to being stabled and fed infrequent large meals, especially of grain • Always make any dietary changes gradually (over 10-14 days) • Avoid disrupting hindgut bacteria • Poor dietary management of horses – beware nasty surprises! • Gastric ulceration; colic; colitis; enteritis; laminitis Essentials for equine digestive health • Forage fed at a rate of at least 1.5-2% of the horse’s body weight per day • Good quality hay and pasture allow the horse to get optimal nutrition • Ideally, no more than 1% of the horse’s body weight should be fed as grain (never more than 50% of the diet) • Include adequate amounts of all nutrients • (water, protein, carbohydrates, fat, vitamins and minerals) • Proper dental care and routine deworming enhances feed utilisation Founder (laminitis) in horses • Stretching and separation of lamellae that attach the pedal bone to the hoof wall • Pedal bone may lose support within the hoof and rotates downward • Causes crippling lameness • Long term chronic problems and recurrence • Very common – 15% of ponies/pleasure horses suffer from laminitis at some stage Sensitive lamellar tissues Causes of laminitis Most common: • Lush pasture or high carbohydrate diet in susceptible breeds/individuals • Very high insulin causes changes to lamellar tissues Less common: • Acute carbohydrate overload (free access to grain in open feed bin) • Colic, colitis • Retained placenta; other severe infections • (All above cause release of inflammatory toxins) • Excessive weight bearing or concussion Equine metabolic syndrome • Insulin resistance, obesity, predisposition to laminitis • Ponies, some horse breeds, prone to obesity • Abnormal fat deposition (cresty neck etc.) • Grazing on lush grass (high sugar content) can result in very high plasma insulin levels. • Insulin dysregulation causes high insulin levels • Predisposes to laminitis (endocrine form) Breeds susceptible to EMS: • Most pony breeds: • Shetlands, Welsh, New Forest, Dartmoor, Exmoor, Connemara, etc. • A few horse breeds: • Andalusians, Paso Finos, Tennessee Walkers, Morgans, Spanish Mustang, some Quarterhorses Why do some ponies/horses get EMS/laminitis and not others? • Different subspecies arose during Pleistocene era (2.5M - 11,000 years ago) during & after last ice age • W. European subspecies more metabolically efficient: ‘good doers’; ‘easy keepers’: Ponies and Spanish breeds • High insulin levels maximise body fat storage (‘thrifty’ phenotype) • Can’t cope with modern lush pastures (developed to maximise growth in cattle and sheep) • Genes + Environment = ‘epigenetics’ Implications for husbandry • Owners should be very careful allowing ponies (and some horse breeds) access to lush pastures in Spring because this may cause laminitis • Lush pastures may be up to 30% DM non-structural carbohydrates (sugars, fructans) • If an animal has previously had laminitis, they are at high risk and should never be allowed on lush pasture (some have to be permanently managed on dirt yards) • Other management options: • Grazing muzzles • Strip grazing • Obesity indicates that insulin levels may be high and animals could be at risk of laminitis if inappropriate feeding or pasture management • Obesity v common in Aus population (32% in ponies and 9% in horses) (similar in US, UK) • Owners perceptions of what optimal body condition should look like External parasites Lice, mange • Biting and sucking lice cause pruritus • Found in main and tail; eggs may be seen with the naked eye Flies • Bot flies – lay eggs on skin; larvae develop in stomach • Midges (culicoides) – may cause hypersensitivity (allergy) reactions Internal parasites • Larvae from pasture - lifecycles evolved as horses evolved • Include large and small stronglyes; ascarids; tapeworms; pinworms; (bots) • Reliance over the last 60 years on regular anthelmintic treatment • Benzimidazoles; pyrantels; macrocyclic lactones (avermectins, moxidectin) • BUT resistance is becoming a major problem • Need to prevent both severe infestations AND resistance • Requires smarter strategies Routine internal parasite control • Should be tailored to individual needs • Use of routine faecal egg count to identify horses that shed high levels • Anthelmintic treatment to provide evidence around resistance • Surveillance of anthelmintic efficacy • Knowledge of risk factors (e.g. target weanlings for ascarids) • Management strategies: Faecal collection; fungus (Duddingtonia flagrans) Farriery • Hooves grow at • Wear depends on ground surface and work • Goals for good hoof trim include: • Bottom of the hoof parallel to coronet • Both heels not too far forward and same height • Distance from centre of frog to the wall should be same on both sides • Angle of the hoof is in line with angle of the pastern Shoeing Aims: • Provides a well balanced foot that enables work for longer periods of time without excessively wearing the hoof down and to help maintain the hoof shape. • The use of horse shoes can give the horse a secure grip • groove called a fuller which runs around the surface of the shoe • grip also can be aided by use of studs • Correcting conformation • Horses with hoof ailments and poor conformation can be assisted with the use of specific horse shoes which are specially designed to help with that ailment. • Specialist shoes: egg bar, heart bar, racing plates, rolled toe quarter clips • Shoes: steel, aluminium (plastic) • The well shod foot should allow the internal and external structures to expand on impact and therefore assist in lower limb circulation. • Barefoot hoof trimming – advocated by some Breeding • Gestation - ~11 months • Horses are seasonal (long day) breeders • Artificial insemination: • Not permitted in Thoroughbreds! • Now routine for other breeds • Common role for veterinarians • More mares can be bred to a single stallion • Mare and stallion do not have to be in same location • Castration (gelding) • Male horses in Australia are predominantly geldings – • Testosterone provides breeding and some athletic advantages – • but huge management (& safety) challenges!!! – • Castrated prior to 2-3 years of age generally (though occasionally much older) • Twinning • Intervention before day 16 Foaling and foal management • Foaling • Stage I (1-4 hours) restless, may lay down • Stage II (5-20 min) birth - very rapid • Stage III (must be within 3-4 hours) foetal membranes expelled (important) • Neonatal foal management • Colostrum intake important for antibody transfer • Worm regularly from 2-3 months (ascarid worms) • Vaccination around 3-4 months when maternal antibodies are waning • Weaning • Often between 4-7 months of age • Various strategies Vaccination of adult horses Tetanus: • Caused by production of toxins from Clostridium tetani, which is found in soil and can contaminate any wound. Horses v. susceptible • Primary course: two injections 4 weeks apart • Initial booster: 12 months from the second primary injection • Following on: Vaccination every 2 years • Vaccinations can start after 3 months of age • Pregnant mares should receive a booster vaccination one month prior to foaling • Horses with unknown vaccination history should receive their primary course again Vaccination of adult horses Strangles: • Caused by infection with the bacteria Streptococcus equi subspecies equi. Highly contagious. Causes fever, nasal discharge and sometimes abscesses in lymph nodes. • Vaccine often combined with tetanus vaccine. • Primary course: three injections at two week intervals • Boosters: 6-12 months from the third primary injection (depending on exposure risk) • Vaccinations can start after 3 months of age • Pregnant mares should receive a booster vaccination one month prior to foaling • Horses with unknown vaccination history should receive their primary course again Vaccination of adult horses Hendra: • Caused by a virus which has bats as its natural reservoir which occasionally infects other species, including horses and humans. • Primary course: two injections 3-6 weeks apart for microchipped horses over 4 months of age • Boosters: 6 months from the second primary injection • Vaccinations can start after 4 months of age • Vaccinations are recorded in a central database Horse rugs • Horses have evolved to cope with climatic extremes – Gobi desert, Arabian peninsula, northern Europe • Rugging requirements not necessary under habituated conditions • However may be necessary for particular requirements: • E.g. reduce calories required to stay warm (Thoroughbreds especially) • Aesthetics – keeping condition and maintaining sleek coat • Insect or UV protection Code of Practice for the Welfare of Horses • Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act (1986) – Victorian State Legislation • Details of obligations under this act are set out in Codes of Practice • The Code of Practice for the Welfare of Horses sets out minimum level of conduct required to avoid cruelty to horses • Provides information to improve awareness of good welfare practices • Encourages the considerate treatment of horses Code of Practice for the Welfare of Horses Guidelines and standards for: • Behavioural needs • Supervision • Food • Water • Exercise • Housing, shelter structures and yards • Fencing and gates • Agistment • Tethering and hobbling • Rugging • Health • Foot care • Dental care • Treatment and surgical procedures • Identification • Breeding • Training • Transport • Euthanasia or slaughter Summary • Basic husbandry of horses: • Evolutionary background and implications for husbandry • Hoof and dental care • Parasites and their control • Infectious diseases • Stabling/rugging • General principles of nutrition of horses • Conditions associated with diet/management • Horse welfare • Body condition scoring: see supplementary slides • Horse nutrition: PRE-READING for case study","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
