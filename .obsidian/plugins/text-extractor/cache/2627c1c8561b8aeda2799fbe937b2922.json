Having taken a history with Mrs Abrahams, what key information had you collected? On the basis of this information what did you decide was Suki’s main presenting problem(s)? What hypotheses did you develop to explain the problem(s)? (Hypotheses are your differential diagnosis list) Possible hypothesis Worm burden  intestinal damage  shortened villi  failure to a absorb nutrients despite normal appetite  weight loss / diarrhoea ALSO Worm burden intestinal inflammation visceral afferent signals vomiting centre  vomiting Clinical examination may help us to refine our differential list…. “A large amount of foul smelling diarrhoea” What can the nature of diarrhoea tell us about its likely causation? If we understand what is normally absorbed and where, it can help us to identify the cause of the diarrhoea Digestion and absorption • Some malabsorption scenarios: • WHERE is the dysfunction? WHERE is the dysfunction? • Sudden onset of profuse watery diarrhea • Increased volume of pale soft faeces • Chronic diarrhoea with pale fluid faeces (and loss of body condition) • Increased frequency of soft mucoid faeces flecked with blood Regional Daily Net Water Turnover in Canine GI Tract Faeces Intake 600mL Endogenous secretions 2100mL (Salivary, Gastric, Pancreatic, Hepatic, Intestinal) Duodenum and jejunum Ileum Colon 1350mL 1000mL 315mL PERCENT of Total 50% 37% 12% PERCENT efficiency 50% 75% 90% WHERE is the dysfunction? • Sudden onset of profuse watery diarrhea • Increased volume of pale soft faeces • Chronic diarrhoea with pale fluid faeces (and loss of body condition) • Increased frequency of soft mucoid faeces flecked with blood What provides the normal colour to faeces? • Breakdown products of bilirubin. (stercobilin) … and what could change that colour? • Presence or absence of dietary fat • Presence or absence of stercobilin WHERE is the dysfunction? • Sudden onset of profuse watery diarrhea • Increased volume of pale soft faeces • Chronic diarrhoea with pale fluid faeces (and loss of body condition) • Increased frequency of soft mucoid faeces flecked with blood Where does most nutrient absorption occur? • What can we learn from faecal examination? • Fat droplets • Undigested muscle fibres • And what about specific micronutrients? • Eg cobalamin levels in Suki? WHERE is the dysfunction? • Sudden onset of profuse watery diarrhea • Increased volume of pale soft faeces • Chronic diarrhoea with pale fluid faeces (and loss of body condition) • Increased frequency of soft mucoid faeces flecked with blood Large Intestine • Large amounts of mucus are secreted in the colon • Inflammation of the colon results in excessive mucus secretion • (but not much change in fluid content as most water absorbed in SI) • Often straining (urgency) due to inflammatory stimulation of nerve endings Delman’s Textbook of Veterinary Histology, 6th Ed. Having conducted a physical examination, how did your refine your hypothesis(es)? What further clinical tests would be of greatest value in refining your hypothesis? Why? Can you explain what each test would rule in/rule out? Determinants of diffusion (Fick’s Law) • Concentration difference • Surface area of the membrane • Diffusion distance ( ) (in lamina propria) Normal villus SUKI biopsy Longitudinal section of one villus Can we explain Suki’s weight loss? Diffusion α Concentration difference Diffusion distance Have you created a flow diagram to explain mechanism of : • Vomiting • Diarrhoea • Weight loss Mid-semester test review MST • Well done! • Adjusting expectations, identifying opportunities • We understand that some of you will be disappointed • Challenging course • Challenging subject • First experience of ‘system-based’ Veterinary Bioscience approach • Understandably steep learning curve Feedback • Test open for you to review your responses • Each subject provides feedback differently • Do not use the approach in this subject as a reason to ask other subject coordinators to re-open their tests • No marking key • You will learn a lot more by critically examining your responses and looking up answers as needed • If anything remains unclear – contact subject coordinator, who will be happy to provide clarification • Test review with subject coordinator • Priority for students that scored <60% Assessment is part of the learning experience • MST is a ‘mini’ end-of-semester exam • Same format (MCQ, short answer, clinical scenario) but a couple of key differences: • Duration - 2 hours duration (plus 15 mins reading time) • Closed book • Reflect on exam technique • Approach • Which section first? • How often did you look up your notes? • Did you answer the question that was asked? • What can you learn about your approach to the clinical scenario? • Timing • How much time did you spend looking up answers? • Did you write too much for the value of a question? • Study skills • Links to Academic Skills Unit resources in ‘Subject Information’ module • Individual consultations are available Let’s review • 15 MCQs • Not going to review these – hopefully you can work out the right answers • Short-answer section • Note that marking of fill-in-blanks questions might look strange • Be specific with your responses • Use terminology correctly where possible • Spelling mistakes forgiven, unless where they precluded interpretation Extended-response sectionAssessment for Suki the Cat • Quiz – all students • Released this afternoon (May 11) • Complete by 11:59pm on Wednesday May 17 • Ensure that you have studied lectures related to diarrhoea • Contributes 3.75% to overall Digestive System grade Graduate Student Group Assignment • Flow diagram assignment • 5% final mark • Details on Canvas under ‘Assignments’ or via the case study module • Check groups – same as Cells to Systems • Due by 5pm next Friday (May 19)","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
