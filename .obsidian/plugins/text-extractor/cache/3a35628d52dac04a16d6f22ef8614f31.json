L E C T U R E O V E R V I E W The digestive system includes the digestive tract and the accessory organs and glands. The function of the digestive system is to turn food into fuel by performing the following functions: securing, conducting and storing food; digestion and absorption of nutrients; and storage and disposal of wastes. The design of the digestive system in different species is adapted to suit different diets (e.g. carnivore, herbivore, omnivore). This lecture will provide an overview of the digestive system and abdominal cavity in animals. F U R T H E R R E A D I N G Singh: Dyce, Sack & Wensing’s Textbook of Veterinary Anatomy, 5th Ed.
