We will approach cattle in a yard, move them between yards, and approach them from all angles in a crush, and maybe perform some general husbandry activities to provide context for this handling. By the end of these classes you should be able to: 1. Assess potential risks to safety of handlers or animals in situations requiring movement or restraint of cattle, including: a. Assess the safety of the facility b. Assess signalment and behaviour of the cattle 2. Safely move a small group of cattle from one yard to another or into a race, including: a. Prepare gates and laneways so that cattle can enter the designated yard or race and not access any other areas or escape b. Demonstrate the use of flight zones and points of balance c. Enter a yard of cattle in a safe, calm manner d. Close gates to secure Cattle in the designated yard or race. 3. Demonstrate the safe operation of a cattle crush (with or without a cow in it) 4.
