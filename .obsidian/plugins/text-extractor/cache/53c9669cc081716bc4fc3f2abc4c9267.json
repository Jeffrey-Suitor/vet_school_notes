KEYWORDS kidneys, nephron, glomerulus, glomerular filtration rate, afferent and efferent arterioles, glomerular filtration, macula densa, juxtaglomerular apparatus, autoregulation, tubules, reabsorption, secretion, urine composition, sodium, water LECTURE 19 – STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF THE KIDNEYS 2 – AUTOREGULATION, GLOMERULAR FILTRATION AND URINE COMPOSITION In this lecture, we will examine glomerular filtration in greater detail, and explore the glomerular filtration rate and the factors that influence and regulate it. We will also look at tubular handling of the filtrate and mechanisms of secretion and absorption along the nephron. FURTHER READING Hall JE.
