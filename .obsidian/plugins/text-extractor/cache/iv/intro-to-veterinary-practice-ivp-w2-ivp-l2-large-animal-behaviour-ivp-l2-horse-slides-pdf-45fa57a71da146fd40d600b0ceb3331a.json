Training of horses • Understanding training principles will help you handle them • Horses learn through release from pressure • If you apply pressure, only release at a desirable moment. Anytime pressure is released will train the horse, good or bad! • This principle applies for any training we do with horses and anytime we interact with them Videos https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQtqeghoitI Hierarchy not necessarily linear, depends on motivation Hard to catch horse https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gug5HX4M9UQ Eye medication using positive reinforcement https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO2FUlUtm_8&feature=emb_logo Vet handling https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9BF2KJU_ZQ&feature=emb_logo Take home messages • Understand the natural behaviour of a species, they will help you predict how they will behave • When managing and handling an animal, work with their natural instinct • Social animals are very good at reading body language, become good at reading theirs!","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
