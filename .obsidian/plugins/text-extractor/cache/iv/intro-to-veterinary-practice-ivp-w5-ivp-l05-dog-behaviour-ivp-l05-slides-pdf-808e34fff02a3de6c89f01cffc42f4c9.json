It detects scents from pheromones (chemical substances that transmit information between animals of the same species). • Signals from the vomeronasal organ go to the amygdala, which handles instinctive emotions – fear, aggression, sexual urges A dog’s sense of the world - smell https://www.petpooskiddoo.com/blog/how-is-a-dogs-sense-of-smell-different-from-ours-and-why/ section of the brain • Pheromones secreted mainly in urine but also from anal sacs onto faeces as they defaecate • Pheromones indicate age, sex, repro status, possibly level of excitement at the time of secretion A dog’s sense of the world - smell Images:Wikimedia commons Canine body language The Ladder of AggressionHow dogs communicate their feelings – anxious behaviours video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CQoPPYmveQ http://www.dogzone.com/images/breeds/beagle.jpg https://www.advantagepetcenter.com/ Canine body language – tails • Position • Wagging? • Types of wagging Test your interpretation of tail wags https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFq1Jk0w2EM Summary • Animal behaviour is multifactorial but the animal’s emotional state and the context are significant • As vets, we need to be aware that our actions may result in the development or worsening of behavioural issues • A dog’s behaviour can be altered by what it smells in the world around it, with pheromones being especially important • Pheromones induce instinctive emotions such as fear • Identifying which rung of the ladder of aggression a dog is on is important for safety • Tail wagging can have multiple meanings Module 2 – Care and welfare of domestic animals Small animal behaviour Video 2 : Dogs – preventing development of behavioural problems - puppies Dr Rebekah Brown rebekahb@unimelb.edu.au VETS30030 / VETS90122 Outline of small animal behaviour learning sessions Dog behaviour 1.

Describe strategies to prevent development of problem behaviours to maximise the welfare outcomes for humans and dogs • Genetic – poorly understood • Learned through negative experiences • Lack of prior experience resulting in fear or anxiety • Experience elicits fear or anxiety due to previous event e.g. revisit to vet after bad experience Development of behaviour problems https://www.ellevetsciences.com/ • 1 Selection of an appropriate pet • Not covered in detail in this subject • 2 Appropriate socialisation • Covered in next slides and in case study • 3 Appropriate stimulation throughout life • Covered in next video • Extra resources available in the Helpful resources folder (not examinable) • Marder and Duxbury ‘Obtaining a Pet: Realistic Expectations’ • Dr Kersti Seksel ‘Preventing behaviour problems in puppies and kittens’ has more detail as well as information for managing common preventable problems Prevention of behaviour problems • Neonatal 0-12 days – only senses are smell and touch • Transition 13-20 days – Eyes and ears open but function poorly. Tail wagging begins. • Socialisation 3-12 weeks – discussed below • Juvenile – 12 weeks to sexual maturity • Adult - from sexual maturity • Senior – from about 8 years Developmental periods Positively.com https://www.dogzone.com/articles/pu ppies/stages-of-puppy-development/ • Experiences during the socialisation period have a disproportionate impact • Whenever possible, remove animals when they are having a bad experience • Lack of exposure to a particular situation during this period predisposes to fear and anxiety of the stimulus later in life Puppy socialisation – preventing fear developing Image:Petbarn Image:countryliving.com • 12 week vaccination (usually the first with the new owner) should focus a lot on behaviour as well as healthcare • Should be at least a 30 minute consult and include a puppy information pack with behavioural advice • REALLY important for the pup to enjoy the experience Prevention of behaviour problems – early intervention https://www.petmd.com/dog/puppycente r/health/evr_vaccines_and_your_puppy • Socialise the puppy so that it develops into an obedient and enjoyable pet.

Describe strategies to prevent development of problem behaviours to maximise the welfare outcomes for humans and dogs • Behavioural husbandry - actions that owners can take to maximise the chances of their animal having good psychological wellbeing and behaviour • General responses to poor behavioural husbandry • Exacerbation of other behavioural conditions e.g. separation anxiety, FAS • Development of stereotypic or compulsive behaviours Behavioural husbandry • Adequate physical exercise • Lack – inappropriate overactivity and poor manners e.g. jumping up • Adequate resources • Lack – resource guarding behaviours • Social requirements • Lack – fear due to lack of social experience, over-reacting when has chance for social interaction • Positive experiences (social and non-social) • Lack – over-reaction to any experience Behavioural husbandry – key aspects https://www.dogster.com/dog-training/separation-anxiety-in-dogs • Varies a lot with age, breed and health (0-2 hours/day) • Walks the most common way of exercising dogs – often involves other social and non-social experiences. • Running dog while owner runs or cycles – great cardiovascular but less enrichment • Duration/frequency of walks affected by: • Owner time availability • Behavioural issues while walking – pulling, overreaction to other dogs, reliability of recall Behavioural husbandry – physical exercise http://leemakennels.com/blog/dog-behaviour/dog- training-dog-behaviour/seven-steps-to-off-leash- reliability/ • Can be tangible, such as food and water, or intangible e.g. fun, comfort, stimulation • Dogs find different resources more important than other dogs and at different times • Providing enough of the desired resources at the desired time, particularly with physical objects in multi-dog households, can help Behavioural husbandry – resources https://dogs.thefuntimesguide.com/two_or_more_dogs/ • Dogs are a social, pack species and like to socialise with both dogs and humans • Affected by different factors: • Behaviour • Inside vs outside housing (behaviour, coat type) Behavioural husbandry – social requirements https://www.thrivingcanine.com/blog/ 2014/06/25/top-ten-rules-dogs-house • Meeting new dogs/people • Playing with dog and human friends • Positive training • Companionship • Important factors: • Temperament of dog (enjoying social interaction) • Age of dog • Behaviour (manners) of dog • Time Behavioural husbandry – positive experiences (social) Image:dogtime.com • Chewing/licking • Bones, toys etc • Chasing/attacking games • Other environmental enrichment that provides interest e.g. sand Behavioural husbandry – positive experiences (non-social) Image: Pinterest • Include social details on patient records • Encourage all dogs to walk into the consult room rather than being carried or dragged • Offer every dog food as it enters the consult room • Consider examining anxious/fearful dogs outside Behavioural husbandry in a consult https://fearfreepets.com/why-this-veterinarian- examined-a-dog-outside-the-clinic/ • Notice and reward good behaviour • Be aware of the language you use in communicating with the patient during a procedure • Do the least pleasant procedure last and ideally near an exit point Behavioural husbandry in a consult https://topdogtips.com/dog-treats-veterinarians-recommend/ • Behavioural husbandry - care that supports animals’ interaction with their physical and social environment • Key aspects are exercise, resources, social opportunities and positive experiences • Behavioural husbandry awareness is also important in consults Summary","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
