As such their “fight or flight” reaction is prominent, and their senses are developed to rapidly detect changes in their environment. They have a strong herd instinct which makes them feel safe and less vulnerable. Horses continuously display behaviours related to their fight or flight instinct and their other responses to conflict. Like many animals, horses communicate much more through postures, gestures and expressions than they do with their vocal cords. The ability to read and respond to this horse body language is imperative to in being able to handle and care for horses safely.
