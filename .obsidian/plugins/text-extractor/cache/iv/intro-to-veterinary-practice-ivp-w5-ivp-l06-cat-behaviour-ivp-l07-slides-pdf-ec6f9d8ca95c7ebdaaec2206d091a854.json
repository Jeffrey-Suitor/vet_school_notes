Describe strategies to prevent development of problem behaviours to maximise the welfare outcomes for humans and cats • Predominant sense for cats • Sense of smell is approximately 1000 times stronger than humans • Have a vomeronasal organ (like dogs) and demonstrate the flehmen response when they detect a particularly interesting smell. The animal curls the upper lip, inhales with the nostrils closed and holds this position for several seconds. • This closes the normal airways for a second so air goes through the vomeronasal organ. • Strong odour sense part contributes to some litter tray issues A cat’s sense of the world - smell https://myanimals.com/animals/the- vomeronasal-organ-in-cats/ Wikimedia commons • Pheromones are also important in cats and are released from many glands around the body (compared with dogs, which mainly release in urine and from anal glands • The main reason cats headbutt and rub against objects and people is to leave their scent (pheromones from cheek and temporal glands) A cat’s sense of the world - smell https://purrfectlove.net/scent-glands-on-cats/ • Cats often rub heads as greeting and assessing each other • Use pheromones to tell age, sex, repro status, possibly level of excitement A cat’s sense of the world - smell https://www.petful.com/behaviors/how-do-cats- communicate-with-each-other/ • Aspects of this are covered in Lesson 2 of Module 1 of Fear-Free. You should have completed Module 1 before this week. • Pay particular attention to parts of the body that give clues about how the animal is feeling Feline body language * Pupil size in cats is also significantly affected by light • Marking • Urine marking often on vertical surfaces at nose height How cats communicate their feelings– relaxed cats Naturesmace.compurina.co.uk petmd.com • Sexual behaviours • Female – calling, rolling, body position • Male – roaming, urine marking How cats communicate their feelings– relaxed cats https://youtu.be/5aqzs-wIKm4 How cats communicate their feelings – feline ladder of aggressionHow cats communicate their feelings – anxious body language • Cats use displacement behaviours in a similar way to dogs • Common displacement signs in cats are grooming • Appeasement is less commonly noted in cats then dogs. How cats communicate their feelings – displacement behaviours • Withdraw when stressed or fearful • Development of compulsive behaviours e.g. overgrooming • Many urinary-related problems – spraying indoors, urinary tract disease (FLUTD) • ‘Cat flu’ – feline respiratory disease Stress-related behaviour and health consequences Wikimedia commons Vettimes.co.uk Introduction to the Veterinary Profession VETS30030 / VETS90122 Module – Care and welfare of domestic animals Small animal behaviour Topic 2 – Cats Video 2 – Preventing development of behavioural problems - kittens Rebekah Brown rebekahb@unimelb.edu.au Outline of cats and dogs learning sessions Dog behaviour 1.

Explain options for management of undesirable behaviours in order to improve welfare outcomes for humans and cats • Neonatal 0-7 days – only senses are smell and touch • Transition 7-14 days – start to show independent eating, movement, toileting and social behaviours • Socialisation 2-7 weeks – discussed below • Juvenile – 7 weeks to sexual maturity – play is important. Predatory play starts in the third month • Adult - from sexual maturity • Senior – from about 8 years Developmental periods https://www.mylondon.news/news/west-london- news/4-week-old-kitten-rescued-16391404 • Critical socialisation period for kittens - 3 weeks until up to approximately 7 weeks of age • Socialisation younger than for dogs – often before they see a vet or move to new home • Socialisation to environments and objects as well as other animals and humans • At this age tend to be interested in interacting with everything and everyone • Experiences during this time have a disproportionate impact on the animal’s perception of a given stimulus for the rest of its life • Lack of exposure during this period predisposes to fear and anxiety of the stimulus later in life Kitten socialisation – preventing fear developing Image:soulyrested • Gentle handling and lots of treats in vaccination consults • Role-modelling behaviour management • Behavioural advice handout and discussion from first consult with the kitten • Minimise restraint and do painful procedures last Kittens – first vaccination consult Image:vetcaretauranga.co.nz • As with dogs, educate owners on common behaviour problems and management • Handling and simple commands • Processes and items involved in health checks and medication e.g. use pill popper to dispense treats so later will be easier to medicate Kitten socialisation – Kitten Kindy https://www.stevedalepetworld.com/blog/kitten-socialization-classes-a-kittens- mind-is-a-terrible-thing-to-waste/ • Unfamiliar people of different sizes, genders and wearing different clothes • Children • Unfamiliar cats • Other animal species e.g. cat-friendly dogs • Being handled • Different types of litter • Cat carrier • Car journeys • Objects and sounds within the home • Outside (on harness) Kitten socialisation advice https://www.purelypetsinsurance.co.uk/blogs/how- long-does-it-take-for-cats-and-dogs-to-get-used-to- each-other/ https://www.nutrenaworld.com/blog/kitten-socialization • Home is the cat’s core territory but may have wider areas it marks and roams across • Problems occur when the cat feels its territory is not safe from other animals/people • Ensure there are enough resources within the territory for the cat to feel comfortable Kitten management advice - territory icatcare.org • Inappropriate elimination major issue with cats so very important to educate owners • Size, number and location of boxes are all important, as is the type of litter • Boxes should be cleaned at least daily • Do NOT use strong disinfectants as the smell may deter kittens/cats from using the box • Place kitten in box when they eat, drink or wake up – most likely times Kitten management advice - litter https://drsophiayin.com/blog/entry/ • Scratching really important in cats but owners often complain about furniture • Must provide a scratching option that pleases the cat. Usually like old, smelly posts that owners don’t like • Foil can deter cats from scratching furniture Kitten management advice - scratching https://www.advantagepetcare.com.au/au/traini ng/cat-four-ways-stop-your-cat-scratching- furniture/ Introduction to the Veterinary Profession VETS30030 / VETS90122 Module – Care and welfare of domestic animals Small animal behaviour Topic 2 – Cats Video 3 – Behavioural husbandry of cats Rebekah Brown rebekahb@unimelb.edu.au Outline of small animal behaviour learning sessions Dog behaviour 1.
