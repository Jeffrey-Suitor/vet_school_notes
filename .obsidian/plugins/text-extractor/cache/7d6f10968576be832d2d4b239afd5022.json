The VetSet2Go Project VetSet2Go Building vet erinar y employabilit y Employability, simplistically the ability to gain and sustain employment, is becoming an increasingly important concept in higher education and career development in many fields. Since vets typically graduate with high employment prospects and predefined professional career paths, employability has not often been talked about in the veterinary context. But employability is more than just the ability to remain employed, it is also the capacity to productively employ your abilities through harnessing your strengths. It implies being sustainably satisfied in work that is personally meaningful. It also refers to the ability to continually develop and transfer skills across multiple jobs or roles over the course of your working life. In other words, employability describes the ingredients and the recipe for career success.

The views expressed in this project do not necessarily reflect the views of the Australian Government Department of Education and Training. The VetSet2Go project developed a framework for veterinary employability defining the capabilities most important for employability and success in the veterinary profession. This process was guided by a conception of the successful veterinary professional as one capable of navigating and balancing the (sometimes competing) needs and expectations of multiple stakeholders: employers, colleagues, clients, patients, the broader profession – and importantly, the veterinarian themselves. After conducting extensive research around the expectations of key stakeholder groups, the VetSet2Go project identified 18 key capabilities that are consistently important to employability in veterinary contexts. These aligned to broad, overlapping domains defined by their outcome orientation: Psychological Resources (for the self), Effective Relationships (for others), Veterinary Capabilities (for the task), and Professional Commitment (for the mission), all activated by a central element of Self-Awareness (for the process). A framework for veterinar y employability Employability depends not only on these domains and capabilities as ‘assets’, but also on the actions and social processes through which they are realized – that is, employability is not only a set of attributes, but also a contextually adaptive process. A fundamental part of the employ- ability process is about self-awareness through discovering yourself – your employability strengths and areas for development; your values, ideals and goals; your personal and professional identity. Other process aspects of employability (often called career engagement) include: Work & Life Experience Actively seeking opportunity for personal and professional growth through experience Social & Cultural Capital Building social and professional networks, and learning the ‘culture’ of the profession Career Alignment Building career awareness, to find best fit between work opportunities and congruent ideals This framework is intended to complement, not replace, existing capability frameworks defined around other essential outcomes such as competency and professionalism. While competency (the knowledge, skills and attributes underpinning complex professional tasks) and professionalism (the attitudes and behaviours expected of a professional) are fundamental pillars of an effective veterinarian, these primarily represent threshold standards protecting the needs of those served by the profession, rather than the needs of the practitioners themselves. Turning attention to employability helps to balance stakeholder expectations, and highlight the personal and professional attributes which most influence career success and satisfaction. » » Domain Effective Relationships Veterinary Capabilities Professional Commitment Psychological Resources Self-awareness Oriented to: Effective interactions with others Efficacy in work- related tasks Achieving the broader organisational and professional ‘mission’ Supporting the self for satisfaction and wellbeing Metacognitive development of other capabilities Key capabilities: Collaboration, interpersonal skills, trustworthiness, empathy, respect Effective communication, confident technical expertise, problem- solving, managing workflow Commitment, diligence, sustainable engagement, continual learning Motivation, resilience, adaptability, emotional competence Reflective self-evaluation, confidence, self-efficacy, personal and professional identity F o r t h e M i s s ion Collaboration & Teamwork Trustworthiness Empathy & Respect Relationship-centred Care Effective Communication Application of Expertise Problem-solving Managing Workflow Continual Learning Commitment Diligence Sustainable Engagement Motivation Resilience Adaptability Emotional Competence Reflective Self-evaluation Self-confidence & Identity Fits into and supports an effective veterinary team; works with others collaboratively towards shared goals; is friendly and personable Builds trust through honesty, transparency, integrity Is attentive to others feelings, perspectives and concerns; is non-judgmental, respects diversity of opinion and worldview Bases healthcare approaches in human relationships and decision-making in partnership; respects the human-animal bond Is a clear and effective communicator (verbal, non-verbal, written); listens and seeks understanding; confidently discusses difficult issues including financial aspects of care Inspires confidence through compassionate animal handling, sound practical skills, and application of specialized knowledge Evaluates evidence in support of clinical reasoning and problem-solving; can make decisions despite incomplete information; uses good judgment and ‘common sense’ Is self-organised in their work; manages priorities and uses time efficiently and productively; uses initiative; is independent Is keen to learn, open to feedback, and strives for improvement and best practice Is committed to the veterinary mission, including quality care and welfare, and to organisational goals; takes responsibility Is hard-working, persistent, reliable; gives attention to detail and quality assurance Sustains an energetic connection with their work; balances and refreshes their interest, passion and enthusiasm for work with other needs; is self-sustaining Finds motivation and purpose in their work; is self-motivated and intrinsically driven Deals with pressure and adversity; draws on personal and contextual resources, and utilizes strategies to navigate challenges and sustain wellbeing Is flexible in dealing with change, uncertainty, and shifting priorities; is open-minded Is able to navigate emotional situations and self-regulate emotional responses; remains calm Is aware of their own strengths and limitations, reflective and learns from experience; is self-aware of emotional responses and behaviours Has positive self-esteem and self-belief, anchored in a professional self-concept based on personal values, beliefs, and goals Capabilit y: A veterinarian who...The VetSet2Go Project The VetSet2Go project (2015-2018, www.vetset2go.edu.au) set out to explore what employability means in the veterinary context, to define the capabilities most important for employability and success in the veterinary profession, and create assessment tools and resources to build these capabilities. The project was a multi-national collaboration between 14 academics across veterinary schools in Australia (Murdoch, Queensland, Sydney, Adelaide), the United Kingdom (Edinburgh, Nottingham) and the United States (Washington State). Additional perspectives, including those of practitioners, professional bodies and interdisciplinary experts, were gathered through consultation, advisory groups, a world-first Veterinary Employability Forum (48 delegates, February 2017), and a Delphi process.
