Physical examination • Auscultation • No rumen contractions • Dull ping (“pong”) LHS • Palpation • Per rectum • Gas-distended rumen • Oesophagus • Large foreign body • Oesophageal obstruction Image courtesy Blowey & Weaver, 2003 Saliva • Serous and mucus secretions • Moisten & lubricate food • Enzymes • Electrolytes • Volume and composition vary with species/diet Saliva Cows • Very large volumes serous secretions from parotid glands • Moisten/lubricate feed • Buffer VFAs in rumen • Volume • Cattle: 100-150 L/day • Horse: 10-15 L/day (likely more) • Pig: 1-2 L/day • Dog: 2-3 L/day From Cunningham & Klein, 2007 Role of saliva in acid-base balance • Electrolytes affect acid-base status • Strong ion difference (SID) = (Na+ + K+) - Cl- Normal ≈ 40 Acidosis <40 Alkalosis >40 • Consequences for the animal What happens to this cow? • Cow saliva: high in Na+ and HCO3- • Loss of saliva = loss of Na+ and HCO3- • Loss of water • Cow becomes: • Acidaemic (↓pH) • Hyperchloraemic (↑Cl-) • Dehydrated (↓H2O) What if this was a horse? • Horse saliva: high in Na+ & Cl- • Horse becomes: • Hypochloraemic (↓ Cl-) • Hyponatraemic (↓ Na+) • Alkalotic rather than acidaemic GI FLUID LOSS REDUCED FLUID ABSORPTION FROM GUT TO CIRCULATION REDUCED VASCULAR VOLUME = “HYPOVOLAEMIA” PERIPHERAL VASOCONSTRICTION POOR VENOUS RETURN POOR PERFUSION ANAEROBIC METABOLISM Lactate production Water content in blood reduced, relative ↑ in RBCs and protein Case 2 - FreddyFreddy • Fine this morning, but this afternoon... • Kicking at abdomen • Rolling • Pawing • Flank-watching COLIC! Freddy – Physical examination • Cardinal signs • Heart rate 80 beats/min • Cold extremities • Injected mucous membranes • Auscultation • No sounds on abdominal auscultation • Palpation per rectum • Distended small intestinal loops Freddy – Further diagnostics • Nasogastric tube • 6L reflux • Abdominocentesis • Serosanguinous fluid • Ultrasound • Distended, amotile small intestine Freddy – Laboratory results • Blood test results • High PCV, high TS • High lactate • Electrolytes normal • Peritoneal fluid analysis • High lactate Freddy • Problem list • Colic • Gastric reflux • No borborygmi • Distended small intestine • Abnormal peritoneal fluid • Differential diagnoses? • Small intestinal obstruction/strangulation • Where is the fluid coming from? Gastric secretions • What comprises the fluid? • HCl (parietal cells) • Digestive enzymes (chief cells) • Mucous (mucous cells) • Secretions vary with diet • Gastric fluid secretion volumes • Horse: 26-62 L/day • Pig: 3 L/day Pancreatic secretions • Pancreatic secretion volumes • Pig: 5 L/day • Horse: 60 L/day • Cattle: 15-25 L/day • Sheep: 0.4-0.8 L/day • Dog: 0.2-1.5 L/day • Pancreatic fluid composition • Na+, HCO3 - rich, alkaline • Buffers acidic gastric fluid • Enzymes Biliary secretions • Gall bladder allows concentration of bile • Bile release from gall bladder stimulated by: • Food in duodenum (CCK) • Bile acid cycling • No gall bladder? • Continuous secretion IntestinesSmall intestine – secretion • Mucous (Brunner’s glands – duodenum) • Crypt cells – electrolyte secretion • Coupled Na+ and Cl- secretion • Large amount HCO3 - secreted in ileum (horse) • Water follows osmotic gradient • Transcellular/paracellular absorption • Enters vascular system Small intestine – absorption • Water absorption • Always simple diffusion • Electrolytes • Na+: co-transport proteins, Na+/H+ exchanger, diffusion • Cl-: coupled Na+/Cl- absorption, paracellular, Cl-/HCO3 - exchange • HCO3 -: much used for buffering gastric HCl, remaining reabsorbed (Na+/HCO3 - exchange) • K+: simple paracellular diffusion • Different mechanisms in different parts Small intestine • Peristalsis essential for unidirectional flow of fluid through the GI tract • Obstruction • Structural (e.g. foreign body, mass) • Functional (e.g. ileus, inflammation) • When bowel is obstructed: • Absorption ceases and water moves into lumen • Sequestration of fluid, Na+, K+, Cl- in small intestine Back to Freddy • Why are the changes occurring in his blood results? • Net movement of fluid into GI tract → dehydration • High PCV • High TS • High lactate • Reflux • Loss of HCl • Loss of Na+, Cl-, K+ • Loss of intestinal fluid? Freddy • Surgery! research.vet.upenn.edu Case 3: ZippyZippy • 8 year-old Quarter Horse mare • Escaped, gorged on grain in feed room overnight • Now: Colic, profuse diarrhoea • Consider pathogenesis • Remember Lecture 23? Zippy – Physical exam • HR = 72 beats/min • Temp = 39.6°C • “Washing machine” borborygmi • Injected mucous membranes • Cold extremities • Blood results • ↑ PCV • ↑ lactate • ↓ Na+, K+, Cl- Zippy – Physical exam • Problem list • Profuse watery diarrhoea • Colic • Hypovolaemia • Electrolyte derangements • Differential diagnoses? • Small intestinal disease? • Large intestinal disease • Remember: different functions in different species! Large intestine • Variable between species • Very large in horses (hindgut fermentation) • Dogs: Mainly H20 absorption • Horses: Water, electrolytes, VFAs Large intestine - horses • Secretion HCO3 - , Na+ and Cl- added to colonic contents in horse from ileum • Buffer VFAs • Water follows • Large fluxes between colon lumen and circulation • Volumes of fluid absorption • Horse: 100-150 L/day Large intestine From Cunningham & Klein, 2007 Back to Zippy • Inflamed colon, damaged colonic mucosa • Absorption & secretion disrupted • Loss of water and electrolytes in diarrhoea • Low Na+, Cl-, K+ • High PCV • High lactate • Acidosis Summary • Identify the fluids that are secreted into the gastrointestinal tract with a concept of their relative volume and composition in different animal species • Apply an understanding of the enterosystemic fluid cycle in different animal species to explain the consequences of obstruction in different regions of the digestive tract for fluid and electrolyte balance • Describe how the gastrointestinal tract can be clinically assessed in large animal species","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
