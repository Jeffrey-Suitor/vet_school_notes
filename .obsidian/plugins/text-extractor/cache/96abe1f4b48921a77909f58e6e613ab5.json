Demonstrate an understanding of saving and investing strategies on a limited budget, as well as the benefits of setting up one low-cost superannuation fund, in order to increase financial security - Works in your favour with savings and against you in debt - Interest rates are the cost of borrowing money. - Depositing money in the bank is similar to lending money to the bank and so you receive interest on the amount you deposit - Taking a loan from the bank means you pay the interest Compounding ‘Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. He who understands it, earns it; he who doesn’t, pays it.’ Albert Einstein - Simple interest - Interest only accrues on the principal amount that is invested or borrowed. Often the interest will accrue annually but can be more frequent. - Example: A person invested $200 at a simple interest rate of 5% for 2 years in an account where interest accrues annually - Year 1 interest: $200 x 5/100 = $10 - Year 2 interest: $200 x 5/100 = $10 - Total interest over 2 years = 10 + 10 = $20 - If you continued for 10 years, they would end up with $300, i.e. earning $100 interest Types of interest - Compound interest - Interest accrues on the principal amount that is invested or borrowed AND on interest previously earned. Often the interest will accrue annually but can be more frequent. - Example: A person invested $200 at a compound interest rate of 3% for 2 years in an account where interest accrues annually - Year 1 interest: $200 x 5/100 = $10 - Year 2 interest: $210 x 5/100 = $10.50 - Total interest over 2 years = 10 + 10.50 = $20.50 - If you continued for 10 years, they would end up with $325.78, i.e. earning $126 interest Types of interest https://www.thecalculatorsite.com/finance/calculators/compoundinterestcalcula tor.php Simple vs compound interest Simple interest Compound interest https://www.thecalculatorsite.com/finance/calcul ators/compoundinterestcalculator.php Compounding magnifies the effect of higher interest rates 5 % 6.5 % 5 % 6.5 % Compound interest and debt https://www.thecalculatorsite.com/finance/ calculators/loancalculator.php $5000 car loan at 5% interest compounding monthly Take home messages Compound interest helps you maximise your savings Compounding is applied in debt repayments","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
