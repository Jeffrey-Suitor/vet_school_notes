OBJECTIVES PHARMACOKINETICS PART 2 • Explain the processes of distribution and explain how a “Volume of distribution” is calculated • Describe the concept of first pass hepatic metabolism, and how, along with extent of absorption, it influences the biovailability of drugs administered orally • Describe how the elimination of drugs is dependent on metabolism and excretion, and how these two processes work in concert to result in elimination • Describe what is meant by the term half life of elimination • Explain how withholding period is calculated • Explain the term maximum residue level (MRL) “Volume of distribution” • The volume of body water in which a drug “appears” to be dissolved, after it has distributed throughout the body • Vd = X/C • Where X = amount administered • And C-= concentration at time of administration • Vd is not a REAL volume- it is an apparent one P. L. TOUTAIN & A. BOUSQUET-ME´ LOU J Vet Pharmacology and Therapeutics. 27, 441–453, 2004 Why is Vd important? • Because it tells you how much drug you need to give to get a certain concentration in the plasma • If a drug bind extensively to tissues, Vd for the drug can be very high- much greater than the volume of the patient (or total body water)! Examples of Vd • Plasma volume .06L/kg • A drug that is a protein or is bound to plasma protein will have a Vd approximating this value • Eg aspirin 0.1L/kg • Extra cellular fluid volume (.2L/kg) • Drug exits blood vessels • Unable to cross cell membranes • Distributes evenly in body • Eg mannitol Vd = .2L/kg • Total body water volume .6L/Kg • As for ECF but drug can cross cell membranes • Eg ethanol Vd= .6L/Kg Some really large Vd’s! • Morphine 2L/Kg • Digoxin 6L/Kg • Fluoxetine 35 L/Kg • These drugs bind extensively to tissues! Example: Volume of distribution for a range of drugs in the horse P.L. TOUTAIN & A. BOUSQUET-ME´ LOU J Vet Pharmacology and Therapeutics 27, 441–453, 2004 A D METABOLISM E What happens when we give a single rapid I/V injection?What happens if we give an oral dose? Peak blood concentration is not as high: • Some elimination occurs during absorption phase • Some drug is not absorbed • Some drug is metabolised in first pass of liver What happens to blood levels with constant infusion? Development of a steady state- where amount entering body = amount being cleared What happens when we stop the infusion (or oral dosing?) Drug disappears from the plasma either because it is DISTRIBUTED to tissue or because it is METABOLISED and EXCRETED 13 Drug half-life • Once drug administration stops, there will be a decline in plasma concentration…and the time taken for it to fall by a half is the half-life • Half-life is long if the drug distributes very widely in tissues or if clearance is slow • Half life is also long if the drug is given in a depot form that is released very slowly from the injection site 14 Duration of action: half life • After a single dose, the longer the half-life, the longer the duration of action • However, the duration is not doubled by giving twice the dose….because it is a logarithmic relationship (not linear) • To double the duration would require 10x the dose - and that could be toxic • With constant regular oral dosing of drug it takes 4 to 5 half-lives to reach steady state. • Similarly, it will take 4 to 5 half-lives to clear the dug from the body First- and zero-order kinetics Time Rate proportional To plasma concentration Time Rate NOT proportional To plasma concentration[Plasma][Plasma] First-order Zero-order Constant time for [plasma] to fall by half Variable time for [plasma] to fall by half t1/2 t1/2 ?

Highly charged larger molecules have lower fractional clearance Tubular Secretion • Takes drugs out of blood • Uses active transport carriers • Can remove protein bound drugs • Can be competitively inhibited Tubular Reabsorption • Brings drugs back in blood • Passive movement of drug across tubular membrane and peri-tubular capillary • pH dependent – because only NON ionised (lipid soluble) drug will cross the tubular membrane Pharmacokinetics Free Bound Elsewhere Absorption Metabolism Excretion What the body does to a drug - parameters influencing concentration-time relationship Dose Plasma Free Bound Target Free Bound • Volume of distribution • Clearance • Half-life Not only how much, but also how often!
