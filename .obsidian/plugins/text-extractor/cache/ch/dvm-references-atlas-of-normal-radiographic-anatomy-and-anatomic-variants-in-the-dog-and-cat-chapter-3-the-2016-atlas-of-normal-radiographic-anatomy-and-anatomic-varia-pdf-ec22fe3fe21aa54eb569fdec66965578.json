Positioning for a ventrodorsal radiograph of the spine is less tedious, with superimposition of the sternum and spine being the most important consideration. As with lateral views, the use of multiple centering points for each spinal region is also important for the ventrodorsal view. Although size and shape of vertebrae along the spine vary considerably, each vertebra has a set of core compo- nents. The vertebral body forms the bulk of each vertebra. Transverse processes extend laterally from the body. The pedicles, dorsal extensions from each side of the body, form the lateral boundaries of the vertebral canal. The pedicles are joined dorsally by the lamina, a bony shelf that forms the dorsal limit of the vertebral canal. A spinous process extends dorsally from the lamina. The pedicles, lamina, and spinous process are collectively termed the vertebral arch (Figure 3-3). Embryologically, the vertebral arch comprises two neural arches, one on each side, that subsequently fuse. Vertebrae articulate at two points, the intervertebral disc, which joins adjacent vertebral bodies, and the articular process joints, which join the lamina. The intervertebral disc is a cartilaginous and fibrous structure that allows some motion and provides cushioning. The normal inter- vertebral disc is nonmineralized and therefore of soft tissue opacity, creating a region of soft tissue opacity between vertebrae. There are four articular processes on most vertebrae: left and right cranial articular processes and left and right Survey radiography of the spine typically involves acqui- sition of lateral and ventrodorsal projections, and those are the views emphasized in this chapter. To interpret spinal radiographs accurately, the patient must be sedated or anesthetized to optimize positioning. Optimal posi- tioning is critical for spinal radiographs, and this cannot be achieved in patients who are not sedated or anesthe- tized. The anatomic complexity of the spine can easily lead to an incorrect interpretation if positioning is not optimal. For lateral views, it is critical that the midsagittal plane of the patient, and thus of the spine, be parallel to the x-ray table top. This may require elevating the sternum slightly with a foam positioning sponge so that the spine and sternum are in the same plane. Even if the sternum is elevated, the patient cannot be allowed to lie unsup- ported on the x-ray table for the lateral projection or sagging will occur. If spinal regions that sag are not ele- vated with nonradiopaque sponges, the natural undula- tion of the vertebrae will lead to distortion (Figure 3-1). Another important fact with regard to positioning for lateral spinal radiographs is that the divergent nature of the primary x-ray beam will lead to only a few interver- tebral disc spaces being projected at a size that is repre- sentative of their true size. Beam divergence results in angulation of the x-ray beam with respect to the disc spaces toward the periphery of the field, and this creates a false appearance of disc space narrowing (Figure 3-2). To compensate for this, multiple lateral projections of any spinal region are needed, with the center of the x-ray Figure 3-1. Elevation of sagging portions of the vertebral column with nonradiopaque pads leads to improved vertebral alignment. The perspective of this image is looking at the dorsal aspect of a dog while it is lying on the x-ray table. In the top panel, the dog is allowed to lie unrestrained on the table. The natural curve of the body results in the vertebrae not being aligned in one plane. In this instance, the varying orientation of vertebrae with respect to the primary x-ray beam will lead to distortion. In the bottom panel, sagging portions of the vertebrae are elevated with nonradiopaque pads, which result in all ver- tebrae being aligned more parallel with the top of the x-ray table. This leads to a less distorted lateral projection of the vertebrae. Radiolucent pad Radiolucent pad Figure 3-2. Diagram illustrating the effect of divergence of the x-ray beam on radiographic disc space width. The gray shaded area represents the diverging x-ray beam. The dotted lines repre- sent x-ray photons that will strike four adjacent intervertebral disc spaces. The vertical photon will pass through the central disc space, and the image of the disc space will be representative of the actual size of the disc space. Farther peripherally, to the reader’s left, the photon becomes more angled with reference to the disc space, which leads to an image of the disc space that is narrower than its actual width and not representative of the true size of the disc space. Chapter 3 n The Spine 51 caudal articular processes. The articular processes are located on the vertebral arch at the junction of the pedi- cles and lamina. A cranial articular process joins with a caudal articular process from the vertebra located imme- diately cranially to form an articular process joint (Figure 3-4). The cartilage-covered surface of the articular process is the facet, or face; the term facet should not be used to encompass the entire articular process or to describe the joint. The articular process joints are synovial joints, with articular cartilage, a joint capsule, and synovial fluid. From a lateral perspective, notches in the pedicles of adjoining vertebrae create a foramen, the intervertebral foramen, through which spinal nerves, arteries, and veins pass (Figure 3-4). Except for C1 and C2, cervical, thoracic, and lumbar vertebrae have three primary centers of ossification: one for the centrum, or body, and one for each neural arch. 1 The centrum has a growth plate, or physis, and adjacent secondary centers of ossification, the epiphyses, on the cranial and caudal ends. Vertebral physes, being cartilagi- nous, appear radiographically as a more radiolucent region of soft tissue opacity between the body and the Figure 3-3. Transverse CT image of a lumbar vertebra. The core components common to all vertebrae are identified. Vertebral arch Spinous process Lamina Pedicle Vertebral canal Transverse process Body Figure 3-4.

There is no intervertebral disc between the occipital condyles and the atlas. The atlanto-occipital articulation provides for flexion and extension but not lateral or rotary movement; thus, this joint has been referred to as the yes joint. There are no typical cranial and caudal articular processes on the atlas; instead, there are articular fovea cranially and caudally to accommodate articulation with the occipital condyles and centrum 1 of the second cervical vertebra, respec- tively. The atlas also does not possess a spinous process, and the body is abbreviated compared with other cervical vertebrae. 2 The transverse processes of the atlas are large and are termed wings3 (Figure 3-6). The atlas has two foramina on the left and right sides, the lateral vertebral foramina, which are located in the craniodorsal part of the vertebral arch and the transverse foramina, located in the wing (Figures 3-6 and 3-7). The vertebral artery and vein pass through the lateral and transverse vertebral foramina, and the first cervical spinal nerve exits through the lateral vertebral foramen. The atlas arises from three centers of ossification, a pair of neural arches and intercentrum 1 that forms the body. The neural arches fuse dorsally shortly after 100 days, and the body fuses 4,5 (Figures 3-8 and 3-9) later, in the range of 110 to 120 days. 2 Intercentrum 1 is rarely seen radio- graphically as a separate structure due to its overlap with the ventral aspect of the atlas, but, occasionally, intercen- trum 1 may appear as an isolated fragment, especially when the patient is positioned slightly obliquely (see Figure 3-9). The second cervical vertebra, the axis, is the largest cervical vertebra. Its most conspicuous feature is the large spinous process, the cranial portion of which overlaps the lamina of the atlas (see Figure 3-6, A). Just as at the atlanto-occipital junction, there is no intervertebral disc between C1 and C2. Given the unique articulation between C1 and C2, there are no cranial articular pro- cesses on C2; however, caudal articular processes are present and they constitute part of the left and right articular process joints at C2-C3. The lack of cranial artic- ular processes on C2 allows an unobstructed view of the intervertebral foramen at C1-C2 in lateral radiographs (see Figure 3-6, A and A1). As discussed later in this section, this is contrary to sites more caudal in the cervical spine where the articular processes are superimposed on intervertebral foramina in lateral radiographs. Spinal nerves exiting intervertebral foramina are typi- cally designated corresponding to the vertebra forming the cranial aspect of the foramen; for example, the third lumbar spinal nerve exits the foramen formed by notches in the adjacent pedicles of L3 and L4. However, the first cervical spinal nerve exits the lateral vertebral foramen, cranial to the intervertebral foramen between C1 and C2, and the second cervical spinal nerve exits through the intervertebral foramen between C1 and C2, and so on. Thus, although there are only seven cervical vertebrae, epiphysis. When vertebral physes are open, the ventral aspect of the vertebra has an irregular, jagged margin (Figure 3-5). CERVICAL SPINE There are seven cervical vertebrae, and the variation in size and shape of individual cervical vertebrae is greater than in any other spinal region. The first cervical vertebra, the atlas, articulates with the occipital condyles at the Figure 3-5. Lateral radiographs of the midportion of the cervi- cal spine from a 4-month-old Maltese (A), the midportion of the thoracic spine from a 5-month-old Labrador Retriever (B), and the midportion of the lumbar spine from a 4-month-old Labrador Retriever (C). The vertebral physes are visible in each of these images. The junction of the epiphysis, physis, and ver- tebral body creates an irregular margin to the ventral aspect of the vertebral body. This ventral margin becomes more smooth following physeal closure. A B C Chapter 3 n The Spine 53 Figure 3-6.

If visualization of the dens from a lateral perspective is a priority, it can usually be seen in a lateral view with the skull intentionally rotated slightly dorsally or ventrally (Figure 3-10). The dens will usually be very conspicuous in this slightly rotated view as it is no longer superimposed on the wings of the atlas. Normally, there is essentially no flexion possible at the atlantoaxial joint due to stabilization provided by the apical ligament of the dens, the transverse atlantal liga- ment, and the dorsal atlantoaxial ligament. The apical ligament of the dens has three pillars that extend crani- ally: the middle pillar runs to the basihyoid bone at the ventral aspect of the foramen magnum (see Figure 3-11), and the two lateral, more robust pillars attach to the occipital bone. The transverse atlantal ligament is strong and connects one side of the ventral arch of the atlas to the other by crossing dorsally over the dens, securing it against the body of the atlas. 6 Lateral or rotary movement is possible at the atlantoaxial joint. Lateral movement but no flexion or extension at the atlantoaxial joint has led to it being referred to as the no joint. Occasionally, due to either a congenital malformation or trauma, or both, there is instability at the atlantoaxial joint, allowing an abnormal range of flexion. A good method to evaluate whether the atlantoaxial joint is malaligned is to compare the orientation of the dorsal lamina of the atlas with respect to the dorsal lamina of the axis (Figure 3-12). Under normal circumstances, these laminae should align in a nearly linear fashion (see Figure 3-12). The amount of overlap of the spinous process of C2 with the dorsal lamina of C1 is not a good indicator of malalignment because this overlap can vary considerably between sub- jects. The space between the lamina of C1 and the spinous process of C2 also varies. However, the parallel, or linear, orientation of the lamina of C1 and the lamina of C2 is relatively constant and is a good landmark for assessing the normality of the C1-C2 alignment (Figure 3-13). there are eight cervical spinal nerves. This is in contrast to the thoracic and lumbar spinal regions where the number of spinal nerves is equal to the number of vertebrae. Another unique feature of the axis is the dens, an oblong protuberance that extends into the ventral aspect of the vertebral canal of C1 (Figure 3-10). The dens is difficult to identify in lateral radiographs due to its super- imposition with portions of C1, but the dens can easily be identified in computed tomography (CT) images and Figure 3-7. Three-dimensional rendering of the dorsal aspect of the atlantoaxial region of a 9-year-old Rottweiler. The lateral vertebral foramina (white arrows) and the transverse foramina (black arrows) are visible in C1. The dorsal spine of C2 is rotated to the right because the spine was not perfectly aligned for imaging. Note the large transverse processes, or wings, on C1. Figure 3-8.

The body of C1, termed intercentrum 1, has not yet fused with the vertebral arch and appears as a bone opacity at the ventral aspect of the vertebra (black arrow). The conspicuity of intercentrum 1 of the atlas in this dog is enhanced by the slight obliquity present; note the tympanic bullae are not superimposed. Figure 3-10. Slightly rotated lateral view of the cranial aspect of the cervical spine in a 2-year-old Dachshund. Note the tym- panic bullae are not superimposed due to the obliquity, but the dens (black arrow) is conspicuous because it is no longer super- imposed on the wings of the atlas. Figure 3-11. Sagittally reformatted CT image of the atlanto- axial region of a 7-year-old German Shepherd. The dens (black arrow) extends from the cranioventral aspect of C2 into the ventral aspect of the vertebral canal over C1. The structure ventral to the dens is the body of C1. The black line indicates the position of the apical ligament of the dens, connecting the dens to the basihyoid bone and contributing to ligamentous stabilization of the atlantoaxial joint. Figure 3-12. Lateral radiograph of the cranial aspect of the cervical spine of a 7-year-old Beagle. The dorsal laminae of C1 and C2 have been outlined with a dotted line. The relationship of the laminae of these vertebrae should be parallel or only slightly angled, as seen here. The normal slight angular relation- ship, designated here as angle theta (θ), may be either slightly acute or slightly obtuse at the intersection; in this dog, angle θ is slightly acute. \u0000 56 Atlas of Normal Radiographic Anatomy and Anatomic Variants in the Dog and Cat Figure 3-13. Lateral radiographs of the cranial aspect of the cervical spine of a 12-year-old Dachshund (A), a 7-year-old mixed breed dog (B), a 7-year-old Chihuahua (C), and a 3-year- old Toy Poodle (D). The amount of overlap of the spinous process of the axis with the dorsal lamina of the atlas and the space between these structures varies between dogs, but the linear relationship of the dorsal aspect of the lamina of the atlas to the dorsal lamina of the axis is constant. This linear relationship is a good landmark to use to assess the alignment of the atlantoaxial joint. The lateral vertebral foramen is visible in each dog. In D, the cranial aspect of this foramen is incomplete. The transverse foramen can be seen in A and B (black arrows) but is less conspicuous in C and D. In A and B, note the irregular margin present on the most dorsocaudal aspect of the vertebral arch of C2 (black arrowhead). This normal appear- ance can be confused with new bone formation resulting from trauma or degenerative disease.

In addition, the trabecular pattern in parts of the The axis, or C2, arises from seven centers of ossifica- tion: two vertebral arches, centrum 2, the caudal epiphy- sis, intercentrum 2, centrum 1, and the centrum of the proatlas (Figure 3-14). Centrum 1 and the centrum of the proatlas form the dens; the centrum of the proatlas is embryologically part of the atlas4,5 (see Figure 3-8). The centrum of the proatlas fuses with centrum 1 at approxi- mately 100 to 110 days, intercentrum 2 fuses with centrum Figure 3-14.

Lateral radiographs of the second cervical vertebra of a 15-year-old mixed breed dog (A), an 8-year-old Basset Hound (B), and a 10-year-old Boston Terrier (C). In each dog, portions of the vertebral arch of the axis are characterized by a coarse trabecular pattern giving the appearance of multiple regions of bone lysis. This is a normal appearance that should not be confused with disease causing bone effacement. The exact association between patient age and the appearance of the trabecular bone pattern in C2 has not been characterized. The caudal aspect of the vertebral arch of C2 that forms the dorsal aspect of the articular process joint at C2-C3 is often irregular in appearance; this normal appearance could be confused with hyperostosis from degenerative disease or trauma (arrowheads in A and C). B C A vertebral arch of C2 is often very heterogeneous, with coarse round radiolucent regions; this appearance should also not be confused with a destructive process, such as lysis due to a reticuloendothelial tumor (Figure 3-16). The dogs in Figure 3-16 are all elderly and, although not documented, this coarse trabecular pattern could be due to a degree of geriatric osteopenia. The caudal aspect of the vertebral arch that forms the dorsal aspect of the articular process joint between C2 and C3 is often irregular. This normal appearance could be misinterpreted as new bone formation secondary to trauma or degenerative processes (see Figures 3-13, A-B, and 3-16, A and C). The third, fourth, and fifth cervical vertebrae are similar to each other and generally devoid of distinguishing fea- tures (Figure 3-17). As with the atlas and the axis, each of the third, fourth, and fifth cervical vertebrae has a trans- verse foramen through each pedicle, through which the Chapter 3 n The Spine 59 Figure 3-17.

The cranial articular processes of C3, C4, and C5 are relatively large compared with articu- lar processes in the thoracic and lumbar region. Thus, in the cervical spine, these large cranial articular processes result in the articular process joint being superimposed on the intervertebral foramen in lateral radiographs (see Figures 3-17 and 3-18), and an unobstructed view of the intervertebral foramen at C3-C4 through C6-C7 is not possible. The cranial articular processes of C3 are smaller than at C4 through C7, allowing for less superimposition of the articular process joint on the intervertebral foramen at C2-C3 (see Figure 3-6, A and A1). Embryologic failure of separation of vertebrae, or block vertebra, is a common developmental anomaly in the cranial and mid-cervical regions. A block vertebra result from disturbance in segmentation of vertebral somites. The intervertebral disc between the fused vertebrae is incompletely developed, although a residual vertical radiolucent disc space is often present. Therefore the width of the disc space encompassed by the block verte- bra is decreased7 (Figure 3-19). The block vertebra usually affect two adjacent vertebrae only, but involvement of three adjacent vertebrae can also occur (see Figure 3-19, E-F). The altered biomechanics associated with a block vertebra can predispose to degenerative vertebral and disc disease at immediately adjacent disc interspaces (see Figure 3-19), but the block vertebra itself is not associated with abnormal signs.

Note the larger, and ventrally projecting, transverse processes on C6 (arrow in B) compared to those on C5 (arrow in A). A B Compared to C3, C4, and C5, the sixth cervical verte- bra has a slightly larger spinous process and significantly larger transverse processes (Figures 3-20 and 3-21). The large transverse processes are excellent landmarks for identification of C6 if a limited field of view is present in the radiographic image (Figures 3-22 and 3-23). C6 also has a transverse foramen through each pedicle, through which the vertebral artery passes. The seventh cervical vertebra is similar in appearance to the third through the fifth cervical vertebrae, except that the spinous process is larger (see Figure 3-22). There is no transverse foramen in the seventh cervical vertebra because the vertebral artery is ventral to the vertebral body at this level. The intervertebral foramina at C5-C6 and C6-C7 are obscured in lateral radiographs by their large articular processes (see Figure 3-23). Although the transverse foramina in the caudal aspect of the cervical spine are relatively large, they cannot be seen as distinct entities radiographically because they are surrounded by the dense bone of the body/pedicle region (Figure 3-24). However, the reduced amount of bone created by these large foramina creates focal, sometimes Chapter 3 n The Spine 63 Figure 3-22.

Congenital transitional anomalies are common in the cervicothoracic, thoracolumbar, and lumbosacral junc- tional regions. These transitional anomalies are due to the vertebra at the junction having features of each adjoin- ing region. The most common transitional anomaly at the cervicothoracic junction is the presence of ribs on C7. Cervical ribs are likely due to anomalous transverse processes and may be small isolated structures (Figure 3-26) or more developed structures that articulate with the first thoracic ribs, which are also usually malformed Figure 3-24. CT images through C5 (A) and C6 (B) in an 8-year-old Doberman Pinscher. Note the large transverse foramen (arrows) that is present in these vertebrae. In a lateral radiograph of this region, the reduced amount of bone due to the presence of the foramen will create a radiolucency that can be confused with effacement from an aggressive bone lesion. A C5 B C6 in this instance (Figure 3-27). Cervical ribs have no clini- cal significance. The cervical spine in the cat has no unique anatomic features that differ from the dog. In general, in compari- son with the dog, feline cervical vertebrae are more rect- angular, the trabecular bone pattern is coarser, and the transverse processes of C6 are angled more laterally rather than projecting ventrally as in the dog (Figures 3-28 and 3-29). In addition, the transverse processes of C4, C5, and C6 in the cat are typically less distinct than in the dog and in lateral radiographs may be misinterpreted as new bone formation from the ventral aspect of these vertebrae (see Figure 3-29, A).

Lateral radiographs of the caudal aspect of the cervical spine of an 8-year-old mixed breed dog (A), a 14-year-old mixed breed dog (B), and a 15-year-old mixed breed dog (C). In each radiograph, there are well-defined radiolucent regions in the dorsal aspect of the vertebral bodies of C4, C5, and C6 that extend dorsally into the pedicles (hollow black arrows in A). These are created by the transverse foramina and the irregular shape of the transverse processes of these vertebrae and should not be confused with lysis due to an aggressive process.

Note that the transverse processes of C6 in the cat are angled more laterally and do not project as far ventrally compared to the dog. This renders them slightly less conspicuous on the cat versus the dog. Compare to Figure 3-21, B. Chapter 3 n The Spine 67 Figure 3-29. A, Lateral radiograph of the cervical spine of a 1-year-old domestic cat. B, Ventrodorsal radiograph of a 7-year-old domestic cat. In general, feline vertebral bodies are more rectangular than in the dog, and the trabecular pattern is more coarse. The transverse processes of C6 are less conspicuous in the cat than in the dog. Transverse processes of C4, C5, and C6 are also less distinct than in the dog and, in the lateral view, can be misinterpreted as new bone formation from the ventral aspect of these vertebrae. A B THORACIC SPINE There are 13 vertebrae in the normal thoracic spine. The features of the prototypical vertebra described previously are found in the thoracic spine (Figure 3-30). Paired ribs articulate with the cranial aspect of each thoracic vertebra. The heads of the first pair of ribs are more lobular than found on other ribs (Figure 3-31). These lobulated rib heads are very conspicuous radiographically and can be misinterpreted as new bone formation as the result of a pathologic process (Figure 3-32). The height of the spinous processes in the thoracic spine decreases gradually from T1 caudally. Proceeding caudally, the spinous processes also angle caudally until they reach a point where the spinous process is essentially vertical, or perpendicular, to the vertebral body. The ver- tebra on which the spinous process is vertical is termed the anticlinal vertebra (Figure 3-33). Other definitions for the anticlinal vertebra have been proposed,8 but this is the most accepted definition. The importance of the anti- clinal vertebra is that it serves as an anatomic landmark. T11 is the anticlinal vertebra in most dogs. 8 Breed can influence which vertebra has the features of the anticlinal vertebra, with T11 being the anticlinal vertebra most often in large dogs and T10 being the anticlinal vertebra most often in small dogs 8 (see Figure 3-33). From the midthoracic region caudally, accessory pro- cesses arise from the caudal border of the pedicles (see Figure 3-4, B). These are typically not visible in the tho- racic spine due to superimposition from the ribs. Transitional anomalies are common at the thoraco- lumbar junction. These typically involve anomalous ribs on T13. Ribs can be missing, hypoplastic, or mal- formed, appearing as anomalous transverse processes (Figure 3-34). The clinically important feature of thora- columbar transitional anomalies relates to the use of the most caudal pair of ribs as anatomic landmarks to plan the site of an invasive procedure, such as a needle aspira- tion or spinal decompressive surgery. Failure to recognize a unilateral asymmetry in the development of the last pair of ribs could result in the procedure being performed at the incorrect site. 68 Atlas of Normal Radiographic Anatomy and Anatomic Variants in the Dog and Cat A C7 T4T4 T10 Spinous process of T1 Spine of one scapula Intervertebral foramen between T3 and T4 Articular process joint between T5 and T6 Spinous process of T7 Intervertebral disc space between T4 and T5 Arrow designates vertical limits of vertebral canal A1 T12 Spinous process of T11 Intervertebral foramen between T11 and T12 Articular process joint between T12 and T13 Intervertebral disc space between T12 and T13 Cranial vertebral body endplate of T12 B1B Figure 3-30.

A B C Hemivertebra is another common congenital vertebral anomaly. A hemivertebra is a wedge-shaped vertebra that results from a developmental error. When the hemivertebra malformation is pronounced, there may be clinical signs of thoracic spinal cord compression. In many dogs, however, hemivertebrae are an incidental finding. Hemivertebrae are commonly encountered in the thoracic spine in the Bulldog, French Bulldog, Boston Terrier, and Pug. Hemivertebrae are also commonly found in the caudal spine in these breeds. A hemivertebra is typically narrower ventrally than dorsally, as seen in lateral radiographs, and can be butterfly shaped, as seen in ventrodorsal views (Figure 3-35). 72 Atlas of Normal Radiographic Anatomy and Anatomic Variants in the Dog and Cat Figure 3-35. Lateral (A, B) and ventrodorsal (C, D) radiographs of a 3-year-old Bulldog. There are hemivertebrae at T13 (A, C) and L4 (B, D). The shape of a hemivertebra in lateral radiographs is more apparent at L4 due to the lack of superimposed ribs. Hemivertebrae are typically more narrow ventrally than dorsally and, in ventrodorsal views, can assume a but- terfly appearance, as seen here (C). A B C D Chapter 3 n The Spine 73 Figure 3-36. Lateral view of a 3-year-old Boston Terrier. There is a hemivertebra at T7. The malformed vertebra has resulted in a dorsal deviation of the thoracic spine at this location, and there is secondary remodeling of the caudal aspect of T6. T6 Figure 3-37. Lateral (A) and ventrodorsal (B) radiographs of the thoracic spine of a 9-year- old Bulldog. There are multiple hemivertebrae in the thoracic spine. As a result of the decreased length of the affected vertebrae, the proximal aspects of the adjoining ribs are more closely positioned than normal. A B The most common locations for hemivertebrae in the thoracic spine are T7, T8, and T129 (Figure 3-36). In this location, there is often a dorsal deviation of the spine, termed kyphosis, due to the altered vertebral morphology. Remodeling of normally shaped adjacent vertebrae can also occur due to altered biomechanics created by the hemivertebrae (see Figure 3-36). When multiple adjoining hemivertebrae are present in the thoracic spine, the thoracic ribs are usually positioned more closely than normal, which creates a crowded appearance (Figure 3-37). The thoracic spine in the cat has no unique anatomic features that were not described for the dog. In general, in comparison with the dog, the ribs do not extend as far dorsally in the cat, which allows for a less obstructed view 74 Atlas of Normal Radiographic Anatomy and Anatomic Variants in the Dog and Cat Figure 3-38. Lateral radiograph of the thoracic spine of a 1-year-old domestic cat (A), and a close-up view of the caudal thoracic region (B). The ribs do not extend as far dorsally in the cat as in the dog, allowing for a less obstructed view of the intervertebral foramina in the cat. This also provides for visualization of the accessory process of the thoracic vertebrae (hollow black arrowheads in B), which are rarely seen in the dog. A B of the intervertebral foramina (Figure 3-38). This also provides for easier visualization of the accessory pro- cesses of the caudal thoracic vertebrae (see open black arrowheads in Figure 3-38, B). LUMBAR SPINE There are seven vertebrae in the lumbar spine. The fea- tures of the prototypical vertebra described previously are also found in the lumbar spine (Figure 3-39). Accessory processes of the cranial few lumbar vertebrae are well developed and can often be identified in lateral radio- graphs (see Figures 3-4 and 3-39, B1). The ventral cortex of L3 and L4 can appear less distinct than the ventral cortex of other lumbar vertebrae, particularly in large dogs, and be misinterpreted as an aggressive vertebral lesion (see Figure 3-39, A-B). Intervertebral foramina in the lumbar spine are clearly seen in lateral radiographs (see Figure 3-39, A). Occasionally, there will appear to be eight lumbar ver- tebrae, but this may be due to the absence of ribs on T13. To actually have more than 20 vertebrae composing the thoracolumbar region, typically 13 thoracic and 7 lumbar, is very uncommon 3 (Figure 3-40). To ascertain whether there is a supernumerary lumbar vertebra, it is necessary to be able to view the entire thoracic spine to eliminate the possibility that both the left and right thirteenth ribs are absent. There is no clinical significance to a supernu- merary lumbar vertebra.

Chapter 3 n The Spine 77 Figure 3-40. Lateral (A) and ventrodorsal (B) radiographs of the lumbar spine of a 3-year- old Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever. There appear to be eight lumbar vertebrae. A B A small amount of flexion and extension is normal at the lumbosacral junction. Rarely is this assessed radio- graphically; however, occasionally views made with the pelvic limbs pulled cranially or caudally are acquired to attempt to assess the range of motion present at the lumbosacral junction in dogs suspected of having lumbosacral instability. The range of motion shown in Figure 3-41 is normal. Strict guidelines for the amount of normal range to be expected have not been defined. The lumbosacral junction is a common location for transitional anomalies. Most of these involve the last lumbar vertebra assuming some characteristics of the sacrum, termed sacralization. With sacralization of L7, the most common malformation is for one side of L7 to form a sacroiliac junction and the other side to have a transverse process (Figures 3-42 and 3-43). With sacral- ization, the angle between L7 and the sacrum in the lateral view is typically straighter than normal; compare the relatively straight lumbosacral angle in a dog with a transitional anomaly (see Figure 3-43, A) with the lumbosacral angle in a normal dog (see Figure 3-41, A). Another manifestation of sacralization of L7 is a more caudal position of the apparent lumbosacral articu- lation in lateral radiographs (Figure 3-44). Because of L7 articulating with the ilium, the sacral articulation with the ilium is displaced to a more caudal position. As noted previously, the asymmetry of the articulation of the spine with the pelvis can also create asymmetry in the develop- ment of the pelvic bones (see Figure 3-44). 78 Atlas of Normal Radiographic Anatomy and Anatomic Variants in the Dog and Cat Figure 3-41. Lateral radiograph of the lumbosacral junction of a 2-year-old Labrador Retriever with the pelvic limbs in a neutral position (A), with the pelvic limbs pulled crani- ally to flex the lumbosacral junction (B), and with the pelvic limbs pulled caudally to extend the lumbosacral junction (C). Parts A1, B1, and C1 are corresponding images to A, B, and C, respectively, where a black line has been added along the floor of the lumbosacral vertebral canal to enhance visualization of the angle formed between L7 and S1. Some range of motion at the lumbosacral joint is normal, but the exact limits for normal have not been quantified. A1 B B1 C C1 A Chapter 3 n The Spine 79 Figure 3-42. Three-dimensional volume rendered ventral view of the lumbosacral junction of a dog with a transitional anomaly of L7. On the right (R), L7 is fused to the ilium but on the left there is a normal transverse process. This asymmetry results in altered biomechanical loading of the lumbosacral junction and can lead to clinically significant degenerative changes at L7-S1. R Figure 3-43. Lateral (A) and ventrodorsal (B) radiograph of the lumbosacral region of a 4-year-old mixed breed dog. There is sacralization of the right aspect of L7. In B, on the right side, L7 is enlarged laterally and articulates with the sacrum forming a sacroiliac joint, and, on the left side of L7, there is a normal transverse process. The abnormal sacroiliac joint on the right is also associated with an abnormal shape of the right ilium compared with the left. A B The pelvic asymmetry that is associated with sacraliza- tion of L7 can also lead to difficulty in positioning the pelvis for an extended hip ventrodorsal view. The altered alignment of the left versus the right side of the sacroiliac articulation can make it impossible to obtain a symmetric ventrodorsal radiograph of the pelvis (Figure 3-45). In addition, sacralization of L7 has been shown to increase the likelihood of developing cauda equina syndrome, likely resulting from altered biomechanical forces leading to degenerative disc disease and spondylosis with subse- quent neural compression. 10 In some dogs, the length of L7 will be notably shorter than other lumbar vertebrae. This is a normal variant and not clinically significant (Figure 3-46). 80 Atlas of Normal Radiographic Anatomy and Anatomic Variants in the Dog and Cat Figure 3-44. Lateral (A) and ventrodorsal (B) radiographs of the lumbosacral junction of a 1-year-old German Shepherd. There is sacralization of L7. On the right side, L7 has a transverse process, but, on the left side, L7 has a broad articulation with the sacrum. In the lateral view, the angle between L7 and the apparent sacrum is relatively straight, as described in the text, and the apparent lumbosacral articulation is more caudally positioned than normal (black arrowhead in A). Compare the position of this apparent lumbosacral articulation with that of a normal dog in Figure 3-41, A. Also note the broader appearance of the left iliac crest in B in spite of symmetric positioning of the caudal aspects of the pelvis. The broad attachment of L7 to the left ilium has led to remodeling creating this asymmetry. A B Figure 3-45. Ventrodorsal radiograph of the pelvis of a 1-year-old mixed breed dog. There is a transitional lumbosacral anomaly. The transverse processes on L7 are asymmetric, and the sacrum has a longer sacroiliac articulation on the right side. These changes have resulted in angulation of the pelvis in relation to the midsagittal axis of the spine; the ischial region is angled toward the right. Note the bilateral coxofemoral subluxation, greater on the right side, and more advanced degenerative joint disease on the right. The chronic angulation and altered biomechanics caused by the transitional anomaly likely contributed to this asymmetric coxo- femoral disease. Vertical white streaks in the caudal part of the image are from the radiographic positioning pad. Chapter 3 n The Spine 81 Figure 3-46. Lateral radiograph of the caudal lumbar spine of a 3-year-old Labrador Retriever. Note the short L7 vertebral body compared with other visible lumbar vertebrae. This is a normal variant and not clinically significant. There is mild spondylosis at L7-S1, but this is not related to the shorter L7 compared with other lumbar vertebrae. Figure 3-47. Lateral radiograph of the lumbar spine of a 3-year-old domestic cat. Note the relatively long vertebral bodies in the lumbar spine compared with their height; the relation- ship of vertebral length to height is larger in cats than in most dogs. The lumbar spine in the cat has no unique anatomic features that were not described for the dog. In general, the vertebral body length-to-height ratio is larger in the cat than in the dog, and the transverse processes are rela- tively longer (Figure 3-47). SACRAL SPINE The sacrum is composed of three fused segments that become smaller progressively from cranial to caudal. The sacrum is fused to the ilium, thus connecting the spine to the pelvis and the pelvic limbs. The normal fusion of the three sacral segments defines the sacrum as a block vertebra (Figure 3-48). Congenital anomalies of the sacrum occur, as with failure of complete fusion of individual sacral segments (Figure 3-49), sacrocaudal transitional vertebrae (Figure 3-50), and lumbosacral transitional vertebrae (as described previously). To accu- rately characterize a sacral transitional anomaly, it is nec- essary to have a radiograph of the entire lumbosacral spine. Occasionally, in lateral radiographs of the pelvic region, the articulation between the auricular surface of the wing of the sacrum and the ilium appears as an ill- defined region of opacity superimposed on the ilium. Care should be taken not to misdiagnose this opacity as a hyperostotic sacral lesion (Figure 3-51). In addition, the 82 Atlas of Normal Radiographic Anatomy and Anatomic Variants in the Dog and Cat Figure 3-48.

Lateral radiograph of the sacrum of a 13-year-old Siberian Husky (A) and a 9-year-old mixed breed dog (B). In each dog, the auricular surface of the wing of the sacrum that articulates with the ilium creates an ill-defined opacity (hollow black arrowheads) that could be confused with a hyperostotic sacral lesion. BA 84 Atlas of Normal Radiographic Anatomy and Anatomic Variants in the Dog and Cat Figure 3-52. Lateral radiograph of the sacrum of an 11-year-old female Golden Retriever (A) and an 11-year-old male Golden Retriever (B). In each radiograph, the pelvic surface of the sacrum is very conspicuous and the nonlinear relationship between this surface and the caudal aspect of the sacrum can be misdiagnosed as a fracture. In A1 and B1, corresponding images show where the pelvic surface of the sacrum and the caudal portion of the sacrum have been outlined to emphasize the nonlinear relationship between these structures. A1 B B1 A pelvic surface of the sacrum can sometimes create a very conspicuous linear opacity that does not line up with the caudoventral aspect of the sacrum; this nonlinear arrangement creates an optical illusion of sacral discon- tinuity that can be misdiagnosed as a sacral fracture (Figure 3-52). Finally, most dogs will have fecal material in the descending colon and rectum when radiographs of the lumbar and sacral regions are made, and superimpo- sition of fecal material in ventrodorsal radiographs can create lucent lines that are easily confused with fractures (Figure 3-53). Manx cats have a mutation that results in a tailless phenotype in some subjects. Radiographically, these cats may also have an absence of a portion of the sacrum or other coexisting vertebral anomalies (Figures 3-54 and 3-55). The osseous anomalies in this anatomic region can also lead to neural dysfunction causing fecal retention and fecal impaction. In some cats, the caudoventral aspect of the sacrum has a smooth protuberance that can be confused with callus; this is a normal variant and is not evidence of prior trauma (Figure 3-56). Chapter 3 n The Spine 85 Figure 3-53. Ventrodorsal radiograph of the sacrum of a 10-year-old German Shepherd. Superimposition of fecal material with bony aspects of the pelvis can result in lucencies due to entrapped fecal gas being incorrectly diagnosed as a fracture. In this dog, the fecal gas could be misdiagnosed as a fracture of the caudal aspect of the sacrum (hollow black arrowhead). Figure 3-54. Lateral (A) and ventrodorsal (B) radiographs of the sacrocaudal region of a Manx cat. This cat had six lumbar vertebrae only. L6 is abnormally shaped, being shortened on the right side, and articulates with the pelvis at an angle. Note the pelvic asymmetry with respect to the lumbar spine. In B, a small bone fragment (white arrow), a remnant of L7 or S1, also articulates with the left ilium. Fecal material precludes critical assessment of the caudal vertebrae in the ventrodorsal view. In the lateral view, it is apparent that the sacrum and caudal vertebrae are dysplastic/aplastic. A B 86 Atlas of Normal Radiographic Anatomy and Anatomic Variants in the Dog and Cat Figure 3-55. Lateral (A) and ventrodorsal (B) radiographs of the lumbosacral region of a 14-year-old Manx cat. L5, L6, and L7 are fused into a block vertebra. The sacrum is abbrevi- ated, and there are only a few caudal vertebrae. These findings are typical of the breed and may influence pelvic and perineal innervation. There is significant spondylosis at L7-S1 with mild ventral displacement of S1. A B Figure 3-56. Lateral radiograph of the caudal lumbar spine and sacrum in a 6-year-old domestic shorthair cat. There is a smooth region of bone on the caudoventral aspect of the sacrum (black arrow) that can be misinterpreted as callus from prior trauma. This is a normal variant. CAUDAL SPINE The number of caudal vertebrae that are present varies according to breed and whether the tail has been docked. The vertebral arch is present on only the first few caudal vertebrae, quickly becoming progressively smaller until only a dorsal groove remains 3 (Figure 3-57). The caudal spine is also characterized by ventrally located hemal arches that protect the median caudal artery. The hemal arches are separate bones that articulate with the cranio- ventral aspect of Cd4, Cd5, and Cd6 (see Figure 3-57). Articular processes are present cranially but disappear by about Cd12. 3 Progressing farther caudally in the caudal spine, the vertebrae assume the shape of simple rods3 (Figures 3-58 and 3-59). The most common malformation of the caudal spine is the presence of hemivertebrae, which accounts for the morphology of the tail in screw-tail breeds, such as the Boston Terrier, Bulldog, and French Bulldog (Figure 3-60). The caudal spine in the cat has no unique anatomic features that were not described for the dog. Chapter 3 n The Spine 87 Figure 3-57. Lateral views of the most cranial (A) and middle (B) regions of the caudal spine of an 8-year-old Labrador Retriever.
