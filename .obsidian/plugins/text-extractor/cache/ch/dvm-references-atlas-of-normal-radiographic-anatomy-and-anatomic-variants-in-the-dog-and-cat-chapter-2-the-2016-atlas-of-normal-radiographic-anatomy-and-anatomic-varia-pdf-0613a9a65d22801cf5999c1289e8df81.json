Figure 2-3 identifies these bones diagrammatically. DENTITION The superior incisors (superior and inferior are acceptable terms with respect to the dental arcades) are located within the incisive bone, and the canine teeth, premolars, and molars are located within the maxilla bone (Figure 2-4). The maxilla is the large bone that, in addition to the much smaller incisive and nasal bones, encases the majority of the nasal cavity and the blind-ended maxil- lary recesses located ventrolaterally on each side of the nasal cavity. Ventrally, the maxilla, incisive, and palatine bones form the hard palate, which is the physical separa- tion between the nasal and oral cavities. Caudally, the maxilla fuses with the frontal bone, which encom- passes the frontal sinuses and the rostral aspect of the cranial vault. In the dog, the anatomic dental formulas are as follows (I, Incisors; C, canine; PM, premolars; M, molars): Deciduous: I3/3, C1/1, PM3/3 Permanent: I3/3, C1/1, PM4/4, M2/3. The fourth maxillary premolar and first mandibular molar in the dog are sometimes called carnassial teeth, which refers to their shearing functions. Canine tooth eruption times are given in Table 2-1. In the cat, the anatomic dental formulas are as follows: Deciduous: I3/3, C1/1, PM3/2 Permanent: I3/3, C1/1, PM, 3/2, M1/1. In the cat, the roots of the maxillary fourth premolar extend into the wall of the orbit, Figures 2-5 and 2-6. The carnassial teeth in the cat are the same as in the dog: the last upper premolar and the first lower molar. Feline tooth eruption times are given in Table 2-2. In dogs, the carnassial teeth are typically more rostral. The roots are separated from the nasal cavity by only a thin shelf of bone. OVERVIEW The skull is complex and challenging to evaluate with conventional radiography because of superimposition of the many complex osseous structures. This limits the value of radiography for assessing skull lesions. Imaging the skull is much better suited to the cross-sectional modalities of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging, which are tomographic and solve the issue of superimposition and also have superior contrast resolution. However, well-positioned radiographs with good detail and contrast can provide information that can help in directing appropriate patient management or selecting the best alternative imaging modality. Although it is often more convenient to acquire radio- graphs of the skull with the patient conscious or mini- mally sedated, this rarely results in satisfactory skull radiographs. Poorly positioned skull radiographs are challenging to interpret and usually have no diagnostic value. Because the skull is so complex, standardization of views becomes more important than in any other loca- tion. Taking the time to ensure adequate patient restraint and optimal positioning significantly increases the chances of obtaining meaningful information. The skull varies more in size and shape among domes- tic dogs than in any other mammalian species. Various measurement parameters are used to group dogs based on skull morphology. The term dolichocephalic describes long, narrow-headed breeds, like Collies and Wolfhounds. The term mesaticephalic describes breeds that have heads of medium proportions, such as German Shepherds, Beagles, and Setters. Brachycephalic describes breeds with short and wide heads, such as Boston Terriers and Pekingese. A radiographic study of the skull should always include a lateral and dorsoventral (or ventrodorsal) view (Figures 2-1 and 2-2). Additional views of the skull are often acquired depending on the region of interest. They should, however, always be acquired in concert with standard lateral and dorsoventral (or ventrodorsal) views. Oblique views should not be used to replace the standard views because standard views often provide information that allows more effective interpretation of oblique views. In addition, oblique views are impossible to interpret cor- rectly unless a readily understandable external radio- graphic marking system is used. This allows correct identification of surfaces projected in profile. This is par- ticularly important when there is no obvious unilateral disease. This is discussed in the following section on dentition. Approximately 50 bones, many of which are paired, compose the skull. Many are not identifiable with survey radiographs, and most fuse with adjoining bones pre- cluding specific delineation.

The fourth upper premolar (08) and the first lower molar (09) are sometimes referred to as carnassial teeth. PM4 Chapter 2 n The Skull 25 right maxillary arcade. By elevating the mandible with a nonradiopaque triangular sponge and using a vertical x-ray beam, the right maxillary arcade will be projected ventral to the rest of the maxilla without superimposition (Figure 2-8). To evaluate the right mandibular arcade, use the triangular sponge to elevate the maxilla, not the man- dible. To evaluate the left arcades, reposition the dog in left recumbency and repeat the procedure. When a tooth is evaluated, the structures that can be visualized are the roots and crown, the pulp cavity, and the lamina dura. Although the periodontal membrane cannot be visualized directly, its location can be inferred (Figure 2-9). Visualization of both deciduous teeth and permanent teeth buds is normal in adolescent patients (Figure 2-10). Molars have no associated deciduous tooth. Normally, the deciduous teeth are shed as permanent teeth erupt. A retained deciduous tooth can impede eruption of permanent incisors, canines, or premolars. Alternatively, retained deciduous teeth may not impede eruption of the subjacent permanent tooth but become displaced as the permanent tooth erupts (Figure 2-11). Retained decidu- ous teeth are readily apparent upon visual inspection of the oral cavity. Radiographs are not needed for their detection but will be helpful in determining whether the The modified Triadan system of dental nomenclature is an alternative system for tooth identification 2 (Figure 2-7). The first digit denotes the quadrant. The right upper quadrant is designated 1, the left upper quadrant is des- ignated 2, the left lower quadrant is designated 3, and the right lower quadrant is designated 4. The second and third digits denote positions within the quadrant, and numbering always begins at the midline; thus the central incisor is always 01, the canine is always 04, and the first molar is always 09. For example, the right upper fourth premolar would be tooth number 108 in the Triadan system. Radiography of the dental arcade is commonly per- formed using dedicated dental x-ray machines, which generally have relatively low mA and kVp capabilities, used with intraoral film or a small dedicated intraoral dental imaging plate. In the absence of a dental radio- graphic system, lateral oblique views can be used to assess each dental arcade. As previously noted, it is critical that labeling of oblique radiographs be accurate and that the radiogra- pher understands what will be projected when the skull is angled. This has been described elsewhere, 3 but a brief example follows. Assume the dog is in right lateral recum- bency on the x-ray table and the goal is to evaluate the Figure 2-5.

The white arrow is a root of the left fourth upper premolar (tooth 208, using the modified Triadan system). Note the close association of the root with the orbit, the cavity in which the globe resides. Figure 2-6. Transverse CT image at the level of the rostral aspect of the carnassial teeth of a dog. The hollow black arrow is the palatal surface; the hollow white arrow is the vestibular (buccal, labial) surface of the left fourth upper premolar (tooth 208, using the modified Triadan system). Note the close associa- tion of the mesial root with the nasal cavity. Dental abscessation is an important differential diagnosis in canine nasal disease. 26 Atlas of Normal Radiographic Anatomy and Anatomic Variants in the Dog and Cat Upper jaw Left upper permanent 2 Left upper deciduous 6 Left Left lower permanent 3 Left lower deciduous 7 Lower jaw Right lower deciduous 8 Right lower permanent 4 Right upper deciduous 5 Right upper permanent 1 Right A Right lower Right upper Incisors Incisors Canine Canine B Premolars Premolars Molars Molars 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 411 410 409 408 407 406 405 404 403 402 401 Left upper Left lower 201 202 203 204 205 206 207 208 209 210 311 310 309 308 307 306 305 304 303 302 301 Left upper Left lowerRight lower Right upper Incisors Incisors Canine Canine C Premolars Premolars Molar Molar 101 102 103 104 106 107 108 109 201 202 203 204 206 207 208 209 409 408 407 404 403 402 401 309 308 307 304 303 302 301 Figure 2-7.

A, Schematic showing the oblique positioning for radiography of the right maxil- lary dental arcade. Padding has been placed under the mandible to elevate the mandible and to rotate the left side of the patient’s head dorsally. The left side of the patient is subsequently projected dorsally, and the right maxillary and mandibular arcades are projected ventrally. Both a left and a right marker should be used to avoid confusion as to which arcade is high- lighted. B, Radiograph of an 8-month-old mixed breed dog, positioned as in A. A small plastic sleeve has been inserted between the left canines to hold the mouth open. This reduces mandibular and maxillary superimposition and maximizes the chances of obtaining an unobstructed view of the dental arcade of interest.

The thin radiopaque lines delineated by the hollow white arrows are the laminae dura, which consist of solid compact bone that surrounds the dental alveolus and provides an attachment surface for the periodontal ligament. The peri- odontal ligament in health is not visible radiographically but is in the radiolucent space between the tooth root and lamina dura (solid white arrow). The hollow black arrow is the apex of the tooth and the base of the alveolus or socket. An asterisk is superimposed over the lucent pulp cavity within the fourth premolar. PM3 * PM4 M1 Figure 2-10.

NASAL CAVITY AND SINUSES The nasal cavity is normally bilaterally symmetric, divided in the midsagittal plane by the vomer bone and cartilagi- nous nasal septum. Each nasal cavity contains a myriad of fine turbinate bones, collectively known as the dorsal and ventral nasal conchae rostrally and the ectoturbinates and endoturbinates caudally (Figure 2-12). These fine tur- binates support the large mucosal surface area that is responsible for filtering, warming, and moisturizing inspired air. Standard views for the nasal cavity are lateral and dorsoventral views (see Figures 2-1 and 2-13), intra- oral views with the film or imaging plate placed in the mouth, and oblique open mouth views. With analog (film-based) imaging systems, the best way to evaluate Chapter 2 n The Skull 29 Figure 2-12. Transverse CT images of the nasal cavity of a 2-year-old Border Collie. Transverse images A, B, and C are at the levels indicated by the vertical lines in the lateral radiograph D. In A, B, and C, an asterisk is in the lumen of an endotracheal tube. The hollow white arrowheads in A and B are fine turbinate structures that support the nasal mucosa. In B, the solid white arrow is the right maxillary recess and the hollow white arrow is the nasal organ, a region of highly vascular nasal mucosa. The solid white arrowheads are the vomer bone and nasal septum. In C, the solid black arrow is the zygomatic arch and the hollow black arrow is the ventral border of the left frontal sinus. A B C * * * BA C D Tongue 30 Atlas of Normal Radiographic Anatomy and Anatomic Variants in the Dog and Cat plane appears wider in oblique views, giving the false impression of thickening. In addition, the soft palate can appear thickened in some brachycephalic breeds, which have a combination of soft palate redundancy and a large tongue base (Figure 2-18). The frontal sinuses are paired and located dorsal and caudal to the nasal cavity. They extend caudolaterally over the rostrodorsal aspect of the cranial vault. They should be evaluated in both the lateral and dorsoventral views (or ventrodorsal) (Figure 2-19). A rostrocaudal view of the frontal sinuses allows interrogation of the sinuses the nasal cavity is by using an intraoral film encased in a vinyl cassette system (3M Company, St Paul, Minn.) (Figure 2-14). By placing the film in the mouth and directing the x-ray beam onto the dorsal aspect of the maxilla, superimposition of the mandible is avoided. With standard digital systems, because the plate cannot be placed in the oral cavity, the best view to evaluate the nasal cavity is an open-mouth ventrodorsal oblique view (V20°R-DCdO). To acquire this view, the dog is anesthe- tized and placed in dorsal recumbency; the mouth is pulled open by placing tape or a small rope around the maxillary and mandibular incisors while maintaining a parallel relationship between the hard palate and x-ray table; the tongue is held against the mandible using man- dibular gauze; and the x-ray beam is angled 20 degrees rostrally and directed into the mouth. This eliminates superimposition due to the mandible but does result in some anatomic distortion (Figure 2-15). The hard palate is the osseous demarcation between the nasal cavity and the oral cavity. Caudal to the last molar, the hard palate transitions into the soft palate. The region dorsal to the soft palate is the nasopharynx, and the region ventral to the soft palate is the oropharynx. The soft palate extends caudally to the level just cranial to the epiglottis and hyoid apparatus. When a lateral radiograph is assessed, it is extremely important to closely evaluate the size and overall opacity of the naso- pharynx, particularly in patients with signs of upper respi- ratory disease (Figures 2-16 and 2-17). Suboptimally positioned lateral views can give the false impression of soft palate thickening. The soft palate lying in the dorsal Figure 2-13. Lateral view of the nasal cavity of an 8-year-old Golden Retriever. Unilateral nasal disease is often difficult to detect in lateral views of the nasal cavity due to superimposition of the diseased side with the contralateral normal air-containing side.

Radiographic film in a slim vinyl cassette containing standard intensifying screens has been placed diago- nally in the mouth and a dorsoventral image acquired. The mandible will not be included in a radiograph made in this fashion, allowing an unobstructed view of the nasal cavity. Most nasal cavity disorders are unilateral, and side-to-side compari- son is readily possible in this view. The hollow white arrowheads designate the midline between the nasal cavities that comprise the vomer bone and osseous and cartilaginous nasal septum. The solid black arrowheads are the medial wall of the orbit. The hollow white arrow is the region of the cribriform plate. The solid white arrow is the paired palatine fissure within the incisive bone, the most rostral aspect of the hard palate. The fine turbi- nate structures surrounded by air within the nasal cavity are readily apparent in this view. R Chapter 2 n The Skull 31 Figure 2-15. A, V20°R-DCdO open-mouth view of the nasal cavity of an 8-month-old mixed breed dog. This is an alternative technique to intraoral radiography that is well-suited for digital systems in which it is impossible to insert the imaging plate into the patient’s mouth. Some distortion of the nasal cavity occurs as a result of beam angulation. Tape or a small rope is usually used to hold the maxilla in place and can be seen crossing caudal to the canines. The solid black arrow is the frontal process of the zygomatic bone. The solid black arrowhead is the rostral aspect of the cranial vault.

Lateral view of an 8-year-old Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. The soft palate appears thickened. This is due to a combination of soft tissue redundancy of the soft palate and because the base of the tongue is contacting the majority of the palate. This appearance is, for the most part, breed related and common in mesaticephalic and brachycephalic breeds. Figure 2-19. Lateral view (A) and dorsoventral view (B) of a 9-year-old Golden Retriever. In B, the lateral aspect of the frontal sinus is delineated by the hollow white arrowheads. The hollow black arrowheads are the medial wall of the pterygopalatine fossa, the orbit. The frontal sinus is dorsal and medial to the pterygo- palatine fossa and extends to midline over the rostral aspect of the calvarium. It is superimposed over the cribriform plate and rostral aspect of the frontal lobe. The solid white arrows delineate the caudomedial aspect of the right frontal sinus.

An air-filled nasopharynx will be readily visible in a lateral skull radiograph, despite patient conformation. * ** Chapter 2 n The Skull 33 In addition, the ventral aspect of the temporal bone pro- vides osseous support for the middle and inner ear struc- tures and the base of the cranial vault. The zygomatic process of the temporal bone extends rostrally to fuse with the temporal process of the zygomatic bone to form the zygomatic arch (see Figures 2-1 and 2-22). The coro- noid process of the mandible extends between the medial aspect of the zygomatic arch and the lateral aspect of the calvarium and is surrounded by extensive masticatory musculature. The zygomatic process of the frontal bone is larger in the cat than in the dog (see Figure 2-2). A for symmetry, opacification, and osseous remodeling (Figure 2-20). In many brachycephalic breeds, the frontal sinuses are rudimentary or absent (Figure 2-21). The parietal, temporal, and occipital bones combined with the smaller sphenoid and pterygoid bones encom- pass the middle and caudal aspect of the cranial vault. In the juvenile patient, the associated sutures are conspicu- ous radiographically and are easily confused with trau- matic fractures. At the ventral aspect of the temporal bone is the bilateral retroarticular process, which forms the temporal component of each temporomandibular joint. Figure 2-20.

B, Rostrocaudal view of the frontal sinuses of an 8-month-old mixed breed dog. The frontal sinuses appear different when compared with A because of both beam angula- tion and patient conformation. There is considerable variability in the appearance of the frontal sinuses with this view due to a combination of patient morphologic variation and differences in beam angulation during radiography. Comparing side-to-side symmetry is the primary objective with this view. C, Rostrocaudal view of the frontal sinuses of a 3-year-old domestic shorthair cat.

Oblique Figure 2-23. Lateral radiograph of a 6-month-old mixed breed dog. Hollow black arrows outline the symphysis between the temporal process of the zygomatic bone and the zygomatic process of the temporal bone. In many patients, this rarely fuses completely.

The suture between the temporal process of the zygomatic bone and zygomatic process of the temporal bone, due to incomplete fusion, is readily evident (white arrows). suture between the zygomatic process of the temporal bone and the temporal process of the zygomatic bone is often confused with a fracture in young dogs (Figures 2-23 and 2-24). The suture becomes less radiographically apparent with age but often never completely closes in both dogs and cats. Figure 2-25.

The caveat is that the degree of obliquity should lead to minimal distortion of joint morphology. The most consistently reliable method is the nose up technique. With this method, one should begin with true lateral positioning and then elevate the rostral aspect of the skull (the nose) approximately 30 degrees while avoiding any rotational change. The degree of inclination is related to the shape of the skull. Elevation of the nose 10 to 30 degrees in mesaticephalic and dolichocephalic breeds and 20 to 30 degrees in brachycephalic breeds usually gives the most consistent results 4 (Figure 2-26, A). The dependent temporomandibular joint that is closest to the x-ray table is displaced rostrally, which minimizes super- imposition and, importantly, minimizes distortion (Figure 2-27). In some patients, slight rotation along the sagittal plane (10-degree rotation of the nondependent surface of the head dorsally) results in the rostral aspect of the joint being displayed more conspicuously (Figure 2-28). However, excessive rotation in the sagittal plane can result in excessive distortion and superimposition of the opposite angular process over the temporomandibu- lar joint. An alternative method to image the temporomandibu- lar joint is simply to lay the patient’s head on the x-ray table in a natural position. This results in rotation in both Figure 2-26. A, Lateral radiograph of an 8-year-old Golden Retriever. The thin-walled tym- panic bullae are nearly perfectly superimposed, and gas is readily visible within the tympanic bullae. Although the tympanic bullae may appear thin-walled and of the expected radiolu- cency on this view, fluid within one tympanic bulla may go undetected due to the overlap. Additional views are required to rule out unilateral disease. B, Ventrodorsal view of a 1-year- old Labrador Retriever. The wall of one tympanic bulla is outlined by the hollow white arrow- heads. The solid white arrow is the dense petrous temporal bone that contains the bony labyrinth of the inner ear. The hollow black arrow is the mastoid process of the temporal bone.

The dependent tympanic bulla closest to the x-ray table is usually positioned more dorsal rela- tive to the upper nondependent tympanic bulla, and it is the nondependent tympanic bulla that is projected without superimposition (Figure 2-29). The success of this positioning method depends primarily on the shape of the skull and is more unreliable than the technique of elevating the rostral aspect of the skull, as described previ- ously. In addition, it can become confusing as to which temporomandibular joint is being profiled; for this reason, this alternate technique is not recommended. In both the cat and the dog, as in many species, a thin articular disc lies between the articular surface of the condylar process of the mandible and the mandibular fossa of the temporal bone. This is not apparent radio- graphically unless mineralized pathologically, which is rare. The tympanic bullae are best evaluated using the fol- lowing views (Figure 2-30): • dorsoventral (or ventrodorsal) view • lateral view • minimally oblique lateral views • open-mouth rostrocaudal view with the beam centered at the level of the tympanic bullae 38 Atlas of Normal Radiographic Anatomy and Anatomic Variants in the Dog and Cat Figure 2-27. A, Lateral oblique view of the right temporomandibular joint. The rostral aspect of the skull has been elevated approximately 30 degrees, without concurrent rotation (the nose up technique). The objective of this oblique view is to image the dependent temporo- mandibular joint with minimal distortion and minimal superimposition of adjacent struc- tures. B, The same image as in A; the hollow black arrow is the condylar process (articular process) of the mandible. The hollow white arrow is the retroarticular process of the temporal bone; the temporomandibular joint is formed between the condyloid process of the man- dible and the mandibular fossa on the ventral surface of the zygomatic process of the tem- poral bone. The retroarticular process serves to enlarge this joint on its medial aspect. The solid white arrow is the angular process of the mandible. The dotted line outlines the ramus; the solid black arrow at the rostral border of the coronoid process is the coronoid crest. The hollow white arrowheads delineate the ventral border and the hollow black arrowheads show the dorsal border of the zygomatic arch. Each tympanic bulla is also readily visible in this view. C, Nose up view in a 10-month-old Labrador Retriever mix, as in A, characterized by a slightly different appearance to the temporomandibular joint. A C B Chapter 2 n The Skull 39 Figure 2-28. Thirty-degree nose up view of a 10-month-old Labrador Retriever mix. The nondependent surface of the head has also been rotated dorsally 10 degrees. In some patients, slight rotation is required to enable visualization of the rostral aspect of the temporomandibular joint. Figure 2-29. Lateral oblique radiograph of a 1-year-old Labrador Retriever. The patient’s head is lying naturally on the table, resulting in rotation of the skull, in addition to the nares being closer to the table (nose down). With the patient lying naturally on the table, there is often sufficient obliquity to sepa- rate both the tympanic bullae and the temporomandibular joints. However, this positioning technique is less reliable and depends heavily on the skull conformation. In addition, it is usually the nondependent temporomandibular joint that is projected more rostrally and ventrally. The dotted white line is the nondependent vertical ramus. The dotted black line is the contralateral dependent ramus. The solid white arrow is the non- dependent tympanic bulla. The solid black arrow is the contra- lateral dependent tympanic bulla. This method of obtaining oblique images of the bulla and temporomandibular joints is not recommended. With respect to the lateral oblique views, they are very similar to the views used for evaluation of the temporo- mandibular joints. Usually 10 to 20 degrees of rotation in the long axis provides sufficient obliquity to eliminate superimposition of the tympanic bullae. The patient should be absolutely lateral and then the nondependent mandible and maxilla should be rotated dorsally. This results in the lower tympanic bulla being positioned more ventrally. One should ensure each tympanic bulla is labeled appropriately to eliminate the possibility of misidentification (Figure 2-31). Both insufficient and excessive rotation can result in distortion of the bullae that can confound radiographic interpretation (Figure 2-32). When the open-mouth view is performed, the tongue is best restrained ventrally toward the mandible to reduce superimposition with the tympanic bullae (Figure 2-33). The open-mouth view is particularly important when evaluating the feline tympanic bullae, due to the bulla compartmentalization present in this species. In the cat, each tympanic bulla is divided into a small dorsolateral compartment and a large ventromedial compartment (Figure 2-34). It is important that both compartments be identified radiographically. Ideally, the endotracheal tube should be removed immediately before radiography to reduce potential superimposition over the tympanic bullae (Figure 2-35). In the cat, an alternative view is often used to evaluate the tympanic bullae. In this view, the patient is positioned similarly for the open-mouth view, but the mouth is closed and the head extended such that the plane of the ventral aspect of the horizontal ramus of the mandible is approximately 10 degrees rostral to the vertical plane. The x-ray beam is directed vertically, immediately caudal to the temporomandibular joints5 (Figure 2-36). The occipital bone encases the caudal aspect of the cranial vault, and the spinal cord exits the calvarium via the foramen magnum, which is located at the caudoven- tral aspect of the skull. This is an important region mor- phologically but difficult to assess radiographically (Figure 2-37). An open-mouth rostrocaudal view cen- tered at the level of the foramen magnum can sometimes help detect morphologic abnormalities associated with the occipital bone (Figure 2-38). Caution should be used 40 Atlas of Normal Radiographic Anatomy and Anatomic Variants in the Dog and Cat Figure 2-31. A, Oblique view of the tympanic bulla of an 8-month-old Labrador Retriever mix. The nondependent surface of the head has been rotated dorsally 20 to 30 degrees. The dependent tympanic bulla closest to the x-ray table is now ventral and imaged without superimposition. The tympanic cavity and horizontal ear canal are readily visible. The non- dependent tympanic bulla is dorsal and superimposed over adjacent structures (hollow black arrowheads). B, The same patient as in A; there has been insufficient rotation to remove superimposition of the nondependent tympanic bulla. The ventral border of the nondepen- dent tympanic bulla (solid white arrow) is superimposed over the dependent tympanic bulla of interest. BA Figure 2-30. Schematic of nose up positioning for evaluation of the temporomandibular joints (TMJs). Elevation of the nose approximately 30 degrees with no rotation around the sagittal plane usually results in sufficient obliquity to eliminate unwanted superimposition of the nondependent TMJ as it is displaced caudally relative to the dependent TMJ of interest. 10- to 30-degree elevation ‘Dependent’ rostral tympanic bulla TMJ Chapter 2 n The Skull 41 Figure 2-32.

The tympanic membrane is not evident because the image is not optimized for soft use structures. The black arrow is the osseous tentorium.

A, R10°V-CdO view of a 6-year-old Domestic Shorthair cat. Patient positioning for this projection is easier than for the open-mouth view in Figure 2-35.

In addition to the tympanic bullae being readily apparent in this view, the occipital condyles and foramen magnum are visible. The hollow white arrowheads are the left occipital condyle. The hollow black arrowheads are cranial articu- lar fovea of the atlas; this is the atlanto-occipital joint. The dotted white line is the foramen magnum; the solid white arrow is the odontoid process (dens) of C2. The solid black arrow is the atlantoaxial joint. Although this view allows optimal visualiza- tion of these structures, it requires at least 90-degree head flexion and should not be used when occipito-atlantoaxial instability is suspected. Figure 2-39. Intraoral radiograph of the rostral mandible of an 8-month-old mixed breed dog. Radiographic film in a thin vinyl cassette containing standard intensifying screens was placed diagonally in the mouth and a ventrodorsal image acquired. This eliminates superimposition of the maxilla on the mandible. The hollow black arrow is the mandibular symphysis. This persists as a fibrous union throughout life, and a radiolu- cent zone at the symphysis is normal. R PM1 PM4 M1 Incisors Canine when acquiring this view: the very condition one may be attempting to rule out, such as traumatic instability or congenital atlantoaxial instability, is potentially exacer- bated by this positioning. THE MANDIBLES AND LARYNX There are two mandibles, left and right, united rostrally at the mandibular symphysis (Figure 2-39). Each man- dible is divided into a body and, more caudally, the ramus. All teeth are located within the body. The ramus comprises primarily the coronoid process, which is a rela- tively flat plate in the sagittal plane and is the insertion site for muscles that close the mouth. The condylar process is the most caudal aspect of the mandible and is the transversely elongated centrally convex condylar process, which forms the temporomandibular joint by articulating with the zygomatic process of the temporal bone (see Figure 2-25). The angle of the jaw is the caudal aspect of the junction between the ramus and the body. The angular process is a small extension caudally and an 44 Atlas of Normal Radiographic Anatomy and Anatomic Variants in the Dog and Cat Figure 2-40. A, Lateral radiograph of the rostral aspect of the mandible of a 9-year-old Golden Retriever. There is an ill-defined lucency within the mandible caudal to the canine teeth and ventral to the first and second premolars. This is due to overlapping of the two (sometimes more) mental foramina present in each mandible. The superimposition results in an irregular region of decreased opacity and should not be confused with an aggressive lesion. If there is doubt, an intraoral or open-mouth oblique view should be acquired. B, Lateral radiograph of the rostral mandible of a 6-month-old mixed breed dog. An ill-defined lucency caudal to the mandibular canine due to overlapping mental foramina is readily apparent. A B Figure 2-41. Volume rendered 3-D image of the rostral aspect of the left mandible of a dolichocephalic dog. The two focal defects in the rostral aspect of the mandible, delineated by the hollow white arrows, are the mental foramina. As these foramina extend obliquely through the lateral cortex, a poorly defined region of radiolucency is created. important site for muscle attachment (see Figure 2-30). At the rostral aspect of each body, immediately ventral to the first and second premolars, are the mental foramina, usually two associated with each mandible. These foram- ina, primarily because of the obliquity with which they exit the cortex, create a poorly defined region of lucency immediately caudal to the mandibular canines bilater- ally. This should not be confused with an aggressive lesion (Figures 2-40 to 2-42). Dental and maxillomandibular malocclusion is common in dogs, particularly in the brachycephalic breeds. Gross malocclusion is readily identified radio- graphically on standard views. Subtle malocclusion is better assessed by direct visualization. Prognathism of the mandible is common in brachycephalic breeds, particu- larly the bulldog (Figure 2-43). Most other breeds have brachygnathic mandibles, that is, receding lower jaws (Figure 2-44). The larynx is the musculocartilaginous organ at the entrance of the trachea. It is composed of the epiglottic, thyroid, cricoid, arytenoid, sesamoid, and paired inter- arytenoid cartilages (Figure 2-45). The sesamoid cartilage Chapter 2 n The Skull 45 Figure 2-42. Transverse CT image at the level of the second mandibular premolars (306 and 406 by the modified Triadan system) optimized for bone. The two focal defects in the lateral aspect of the rostral aspect of the mandible, delineated by the solid white arrow, are the mental foramina. As these foramina extend obliquely through the lateral cortex, a poorly defined region of radiolucency is created. The solid white arrowhead is the mandibular symphysis. Figure 2-43.

The soft palate is positioned dorsal to the epiglottis; this is of no clinical sig- nificance in most patients. A 1 *Nasopharynx 2 3 4 Soft palate Epiglottis Oropharynx Tongue A1 Larynx Trachea Air within the cranial esophagus Pharynx B and the interarytenoid cartilages are not radiographically visible, and only part of the arytenoid cartilage is visible. The hyoid apparatus comprises the paired stylohyoid, epihyoid, ceratohyoid, and thyrohyoid bones and the unpaired basihyoid bone (Figure 2-46). The basihyoid bone lies in the transverse plane, giving it depth in the lateral view. This results in increased opacity relative to the remaining bones of the larynx and hyoid apparatus. The epiglottis, with its wide base caudally and thin apex cranially, extends craniodorsally from the cranioventral aspect of the larynx. Its association with the soft palate is variable, influenced primarily by sedation and the pres- ence or absence of an endotracheal tube. It is usually completely surrounded by air and is a constant landmark. However, occasionally, the oral surface will silhouette with the tongue, particularly if the head is flexed, which reduces conspicuity. In the cat, the corniculate and cunei- form processes of arytenoid cartilage are absent. The morphology of the hyoid apparatus and associ- ated larynx is best evaluated on a well-positioned lateral view with the head moderately extended. Excessive head flexion results in unwanted superimposition of the mandible over the larynx. When evaluating the larynx, take care to ensure that the pinnae are positioned dorsally and are not superimposed over the region of interest, which can result in additional soft tissue and gas opacities and complicate radiographic interpretation (Figure 2-47).

Alternating soft tissue and gas opacities superimposed over the caudal aspect of the calvarium is trapped air within the vertical canals. The hollow white arrowheads are the caudal border of the pinnae. The ears should be positioned dorsally, particularly when the larynx is imaged, because superimposition can complicate radiographic interpretation. B, The pinnae are falling ventrally. There are multiple gas and soft tissue opacities superim- posed over the larynx, thus complicating radiographic assessment. The solid white arrowheads are the ventral border of an artifact created by the superimposed pinnae. The hollow white arrowheads are the edges of the pinnae.
