For lateral views, the goal should be to have the cau- dodorsal rib heads superimposed (Figure 6-2). This is usually accomplished by elevating the sternum with a small piece of nonradiopaque padding, for example, a The thorax is well suited to radiographic imaging due to the inherent subject contrast afforded by the air-filled lungs. The craniocaudal field-of-view should extend from cranial to the manubrium to at least one to two vertebral body lengths caudal to the most dorsocaudal limit of the diaphragm (Figure 6-1). Dorsoventrally, the entire limits Figure 6-1. Left lateral radiograph of a canine thorax. The edges of the illustration represent minimum beam collimation. Figure 6-2. A, Lateral radiograph of a 4-year-old Rottweiler. The dog was positioned opti- mally for thoracic radiography. The most dorsal aspects of the caudal ribs are nearly perfectly superimposed, indicating that the sagittal plane of the patient is perpendicular to the central x-ray beam. Note that each entire rib is not directly superimposed on its counterpart. This is common and is not a prerequisite for adequate patient positioning. B, Lateral radiograph of a 6-year-old Doberman Pinscher. This dog was not positioned optimally for thoracic radiog- raphy. Note the superimposition of lung on the thoracic spine. One rib head is more dorsal than its counterpart. Most of the time, the most dorsal rib is the one closest to the x-ray table as a result of failure to elevate the sternum; that is, the sternum is closer to the table top than the spine. This is readily corrected by placing a nonradiopaque pad under the dependent axilla or sternum. A B 184 Atlas of Normal Radiographic Anatomy and Anatomic Variants in the Dog and Cat Figure 6-3. A, Left lateral radiographs of a 12-year-old Siberian Husky, acquired at peak inspiration with the patient unsedated. B was acquired at expiration with the patient sedated. The heart appears larger in the sedated image mainly due to less thoracic expansion; however, increased cardiac chamber filling associated with sedation-induced bradycardia also occurs. In addition, there is an increase in lung opacity in B. Decreased aeration and positional atelectasis will reduce pulmonary lesion conspicuity. BA foam pad placed under the axilla so that the sternum is in the same horizontal plane as the spine. In brachyce- phalic breeds or animals with a dorsoventrally com- pressed thorax, the sternum may actually need to be rotated toward the table rather than elevated to achieve superimposition of the rib heads. The forelimbs should be pulled cranially and the head and the neck extended slightly. The central axis of the x-ray beam (crosshairs) should be centered just caudal to the caudal aspect of the scapula in dogs and approximately 1 inch caudal to the caudal aspect of the scapula in cats. The radiographic exposure should be made during peak inspiration to ensure optimal lung aeration (dis- cussed in detail later). If possible, thoracic radiographs should be acquired without patient sedation, because sedation decreases lung aeration, leading to increased pulmonary opacity. This increased opacity reduces the conspicuity of pulmonary lesions and can be misinter- preted as an abnormal lung pattern. The thorax is a complex moving structure, so a radiograph acquired at peak inspiration can appear very different from a radiograph acquired later at peak expiration. A single radiograph is only a “snapshot in time” and might not reflect intrathoracic pathophysiology or disease accu- rately (Figure 6-3). In a lateral thoracic radiograph with correct image blackness and contrast, the skeletal structures, such as the thoracic spinous processes, and the pulmonary paren- chymal structures in the narrowest part of the thorax, cranial to the heart, can both be visualized (Figure 6-4). With film-screen systems, this is best achieved by using high kVp/low mAs exposure factors and a film-screen combination that has wide latitude (long scale of con- trast). These imaging parameters result in extended gray- scale and improved lesion conspicuity. The ability to see all structures within the image regardless of physical density and thickness is achieved much more easily with a digital imaging system. The thoracic region has large differences in physical density and patient thickness, which challenges any imaging system. In addition, the thorax is undergoing continuous motion during radiographic exposure due to breathing and cardiac pulsations. A short exposure time is critical to avoiding motion artifact, which results in image blurring (Figure 6-5). Quality thoracic radiographs are best achieved by using an x-ray machine with a high mA output (so that exposure times can be minimized), an optimally configured digital imaging system, and a high kVp and low mAs technique. A minimum of three views should compose the basic thoracic study: left and right lateral recumbent views and one orthogonal view, either the dorsoventral (DV) view or the ventrodorsal (VD) view. Significant disease can be missed unless these three views are always acquired. The reason for routinely acquiring both lateral views relates to the normal physiologic pulmonary atelectasis that occurs in the dependent lung. The dependent lung in a lateral view is less aerated, which often results in disease in that lung being obscured by the adjacent increased lung opacity. Acquiring both recumbent lateral views obviates this problem (Figure 6-6). Recumbency-associated atelectasis also occurs in VD and DV views, but not to the same extent as in lateral Chapter 6 n The Thorax 185 A B Figure 6-4. A, Lateral radiograph of the cranial aspect of the thorax of a large breed dog. With the digital imaging system used for A, it is not possible to manipulate image brightness and contrast so that the thoracic spinous processes and cranioventral lung could be displayed together optimally; this is similar to that achievable with film-screen systems. B, Lateral radiograph of the cranial aspect of the thorax of dog of similar size. The digital imaging system used to create this radiograph has superior processing capabili- ties, resulting in enhanced dynamic range, allowing for optimal visualization of bone and soft tissue structures simultaneously. Figure 6-5. Ventrodorsal radiograph of a 10-year-old American Cocker Spaniel. The patient was panting during radiography, and motion artifact is present. The lateral thoracic wall has more blur than the spine. Motion artifact will compromise radiographic interpretation significantly. 186 Atlas of Normal Radiographic Anatomy and Anatomic Variants in the Dog and Cat Figure 6-6. A, Ventrodorsal radiograph of a 12-year-old Golden Retriever made with the dog in left lateral recumbency and using a horizontally directed x-ray beam to illustrate the mag- nitude of atelectasis that occurs in the dependent lung. The patient had been lying on the left side for 15 minutes before radiography. The resulting atelectasis of the dependent left lung leads to a shift of the heart and mediastinal structures to the recumbent left side. The dependent lung has reduced aeration and increased opacity. Recumbency-associated atelec- tasis occurs in every patient placed in lateral recumbency for routine thoracic radiography; this normal physiologic phenomenon can result in misdiagnosis because disease in the dependent lung silhouettes with the atelectatic lung and reduces lesion conspicuity. To over- come this, both left and right lateral radiographs should be acquired in every routine thoracic radiographic examination. B, Ventrodorsal radiograph of a 7-year-old Domestic Medium-hair cat. There is increased opacity in the left lung, especially cranially, and a leftward mediastinal shift. Although the possibility of parenchymal disease cannot be ruled out, the radiographic appearance is most likely associated with recumbency-related atelectasis. Avoiding chemical restraint and ensuring the patient is not in prolonged lateral recumbency before radiography will minimize this. C, Ventrodorsal radiograph of a 12-year-old mixed breed dog. There is a marked leftward shift of mediastinal structures and increased opacity in the left hemithorax. This is due to recumbency-associated atelectasis and not pulmonary disease. A CB Chapter 6 n The Thorax 187 but this is usually abbreviated to just left lateral view (Figure 6-9). In the left lateral view, the diaphragmatic crura diverge dorsally, with the left crus typically being more cranial than the right crus. The left crus has no unique distinguishing features, but the right crus is identified by its confluence with the caudal vena cava, which passes through the caval hiatus in the right side of the diaphragm. The effect of recumbency on the relative position of the left and right diaphragmatic crus is fairly constant, but these relationships are not observed in every dog, or in cats. Sometimes the right crus is more cranial in the left lateral view. The more cranial location of the left crus typically seen in left lateral radio- graphs is due both to pressure from abdominal organs pushing the left side of the diaphragm cranially and to decreased lung aeration in the dependent left lung (Figure 6-10). With regard to the heart, there is generally less heart- to-sternal contact in the left lateral view compared with the right lateral view. Pulmonary vessels are arranged as a pulmonary artery– pulmonary vein pair, with an interposed bronchus. In lateral views, pulmonary arteries are dorsal to the bron- chus and pulmonary veins are ventral. In VD or DV radio- graphs, pulmonary arteries are lateral to the bronchus, and pulmonary veins are medial. Careful examination of views. The absolute least amount of recumbency- associated atelectasis occurs with the subject in sternal recumbency, that is, the DV view. Although typically only either a VD view or a DV view is acquired, there are many situations in which obtaining both VD and DV views provides additional diagnostic information. Typically, dorsally located pul- monary lesions are more conspicuous in the DV view; conversely, ventrally located lesions, including disease in the accessory lobe, are more conspicuous in the VD view (Figure 6-7). As with the abdomen, there are important anatomic differences between various views; understanding these variations enhances interpretation accuracy. Fairly consis- tent differences in appearance exist between left and right lateral views (and between DV and VD views) that, in most situations, readily distinguish them apart from each other. Figure 6-8 shows an overview of the major organs visible with thoracic radiography. LEFT LATERAL VIEW For a left lateral thoracic radiograph, the patient is in left recumbency and the x-ray beam enters the right side of the thorax. Based on correct radiographic nomencla- ture, this projection should be termed a right-left view 1 Figure 6-7. Dorsoventral (A) and ventrodorsal (B) radiographs of a 12-year-old mixed breed dog. In A, the dome of the diaphragm contacts the caudal border of the heart, and the apex of the heart is shifted to the left. This is relatively common in the dorsoventral view, especially in large dogs. There is much less cardiosternal contact in the ventrodorsal view (B), and the heart is not shifted. There is increased conspicuity of the dorsally located caudal lobar arteries on the dorsoventral view (white arrows). A dorsally located pulmonary mass has increased conspicuity in the dorsoventral view compared with the ventrodorsal view.

The left crus is cranial to the right crus; the caudal vena cava can be seen entering the right crus. A small amount of gas is present within the pylorus. B, Left lateral radiograph of an 8-year-old Greyhound. The fundus is moderately distended with ingesta and is readily visible caudal to the left crus. The position of the gastric fundus relative to the left crus can also be used to assist in differentiating the left crus from the right crus. In both A and B, the left crus is cranial to the right crus due to a combination of decreased aeration in the recumbent left lung and pressure from abdominal organs. The pylorus is gas-filled because gas rises to the right side. C, The same image as A, magnified over the caudal vena cava. The caudal vena cava (dorsal margin delineated by white arrows) extends beyond the left crus and enters the more caudal right crus. A B C 190 Atlas of Normal Radiographic Anatomy and Anatomic Variants in the Dog and Cat the pulmonary artery and pulmonary vein should not be inferred as the size of the bronchus. Identification of a mineralized bronchial wall facilitates assessment of the absolute bronchus diameter, but mineralized bronchial walls are not visible in every patient (see Figures 6-11 and 6-13). The right lung, being nondependent in a left lateral radiograph, is not affected by abdominal pressure and is better aerated than the dependent left lung. This opti- mizes visualization of normal pulmonary structures on the right side and the conspicuity of right-sided lesions. In a left lateral view, the vessels superimposed over the heart are typically the right middle lobar pulmonary artery and pulmonary vein. These vessels are commonly mistaken for coronary vessels. Pulmonary vessels are readily apparent radiographically because they are sur- rounded by air in the lung. The air increases vessel pulmonary artery–pulmonary vein pairs should be routine because a disparity in size is often the first radio- graphic sign of serious cardiovascular disease. The right cranial lobe pulmonary artery–pulmonary vein pair is typically the easiest to identify. This pulmonary artery– pulmonary vein pair is most conspicuous in the left lateral view where they are ventral to the left cranial lobe pulmonary vessels (see Figures 6-8, 6-11 and 6-12). Pulmonary artery–pulmonary vein pairs should be evalu- ated in terms of their size, relative to each other, and their absolute size. The cranial lobe pulmonary vessels are usually equal in size to the width of the fourth rib at its narrowest point. 2 Interposed between any pulmonary artery and vein is the corresponding bronchus. Importantly, a bronchus does not always occupy the entire space between a pul- monary artery and vein; therefore, the distance between Figure 6-11. A, Left lateral radiograph of an 8-year-old Greyhound, centered on the cranial lobe pulmonary vessels. The left and right cranial lobe pulmonary vessels are almost always easier to discern in the left lateral view than in the right lateral view. The right cranial lobe pulmonary vessels and bronchus are more ventral than the left cranial lobe pulmonary vessels and bronchus. The most ventral structure is the right cranial lobe pulmonary vein. The dorsal vessel is the right cranial lobe pulmonary artery. The radiolucent structure between the two pulmonary vessels is the right cranial lobe bronchus. Importantly, the bronchus does not always occupy the entire space between the pulmonary artery and pulmonary vein, and the distance between these pulmonary vessels should not be inferred to represent the size of the bronchus. Identification of a mineralized bronchial wall facilitates assessment of the bron- chus diameter, but mineralized bronchial walls are not visible in every patient. The vessel/ bronchus triad seen dorsal to the right cranial lobe pulmonary artery–pulmonary vein pair in this figure is associated with the cranial part of the left cranial lung lobe. B, Left lateral radiograph of a 9-year-old mixed breed dog. The right and left cranial lobe pulmonary vessels are easy to differentiate. The wall of the right cranial lobe bronchus is mineralized (white arrow), and the bronchus clearly does not occupy the entire distance between the right cranial lobe pulmonary artery and the pulmonary vein.

In image A, the pulmonary vasculature is readily evident as the curvilinear arborizing soft tissue attenuating structures distributed throughout the lung. Image B is a thin slice image at approximately the same level. In both images, the structure depicted by the solid black arrow is the left caudal lobar artery. The structure delineated by the hollow white arrow is the left caudal lobar vein. The tubular structure between the two vessels is the left caudal lobar bronchus. The bronchus does not occupy the entire space between the artery and vein and is only evident in this study due to the enhanced contrast resolution of CT.

This results in border effacement and makes radiographic differentiation between heart and coronary vessel impossible (Figures 6-14 and 6-15, A-B). conspicuity because it has a lower physical density and is much more radiolucent. The better the lung aeration, the more conspicuous pulmonary vessels and other paren- chymal structures become. Coronary vessels are not visible without the administration of contrast medium or Figure 6-14. Left lateral radiograph of an 8-year-old Greyhound centered over the heart. The pulmonary vessels overlying the caudal third of the heart are associated with the right middle lung lobe. These do not represent coronary vessels. Visualization of pulmo- nary vessels is due to the presence of surrounding air. Coronary vessels are of the same opacity as myocardium; they are not visible radiographically unless injected with intravenous contrast medium or there is mineralization of the vessel wall.

Access to the aorta was via the femoral artery. The aortic root and coro- nary vessels are not visible. In B, radiopaque contrast medium has been injected into the ascending aorta. This is opacifying the ascending aorta and the coronary arteries (black arrow heads). The vessels now have a differing attenuation (metallic) due to the presence of the contrast medium and are now readily visible. The normal aortic valve (black arrow) is prevent- ing retrograde flow of contrast medium into the left ventricular outflow tract. BA Chapter 6 n The Thorax 193 RIGHT LATERAL VIEW In the right lateral view, the patient lies in right recum- bency and the x-ray beam enters the left side of the thorax. Similar to the left lateral view, based on correct radio- graphic nomenclature, this radiograph projection should be called a left-right view, but this is usually abbreviated to just a right lateral view (Figure 6-16). In the right lateral view, the diaphragmatic crura are usually parallel (Figure 6-17). The right crus is typically more cranial than the left; however, as mentioned previously, this relationship does not hold in every normal dog, or in cats. Opposite to the left lateral view, there is often more heart-to- sternal contact in the right lateral view. The right cranial lobe pulmonary artery and pulmonary vein are typically more dorsal than in the left lateral view and become superimposed on the left cranial pulmonary artery and Figure 6-16. A, Right lateral radiograph of an 8-year-old Greyhound. The diaphragmatic crura are parallel with the right crus more cranial than the left crus. Ingesta is present within the fundus, caudal to the more caudal left crus of the diaphragm. The caudal vena cava can be seen entering the right crus. The left and right cranial lobe pulmonary vessels are super- imposed and more difficult to discern accurately. This commonly occurs in the right lateral view. B, Right lateral radiograph of a 9-year-old mixed breed dog. The caudal vena cava can be seen entering the more cranial right crus. Cranial lobe pulmonary vessels from the left and right sides are superimposed, and accurate discrimination between arteries and veins is impossible. A B Figure 6-17. Right lateral radiograph of an 8-year-old Greyhound, centered on the diaphragm. The diaphragmatic crura are parallel to each other, with the right crus being more cranial. The caudal vena cava enters the right crus. The right crus is more cranial due to reduced aeration of the dependent right lung and pressure from abdominal organs. A small amount of gas is present in the stomach, including the pylorus.

The dorsal shift of a right-sided pulmonary mass in the right lateral radiographs illustrates the magnitude of ana- tomic shift (rise) that occurs in the dependent lung (Figure 6-19). Vessels to the caudal part of the left cranial lung lobe and cranioventral aspect of the left caudal lung lobe are usually visible overlying the caudal aspect of the cardiac silhouette (Figure 6-20). These, too, are sometimes incor- rectly identified as coronary vessels. pulmonary vein (Figure 6-18). This results in confusion and inaccuracy with regard to assessing the relative and absolute size of the cranial lobe pulmonary vessels. The more dorsal positioning of the right cranial lobe pulmo- nary vessels on the right lateral view is due to the effect of compression of the dependent hemithorax. As the dependent hemithorax is compressed, the lung is forced dorsally. Not only do normal structures in the dependent lung become displaced dorsally, but also pulmonary lesions. This occurs in both left and right lateral views Figure 6-18. A, Right lateral radiograph of an 8-year-old Greyhound, centered on the cranial lobe pulmonary vessels. The left and right cranial lobe pulmonary vessels and the bronchi are superimposed, making accurate assessment of the absolute and relative size of the cranial lobe pulmonary vessels impossible. In the right lateral view, the cranial lobe pulmonary vessels are displaced dorsally compared with their location in the left lateral view, resulting in superimposition over the left-sided pulmonary vessels/bronchus. B, Right lateral radio- graph of a 9-year-old mixed breed dog, centered on the cranioventral lung lobes. Superimposition of the left and right cranial lobe pulmonary vessels and bronchi makes accurate assessment of absolute and relative vessel size impossible. This superimposition of left and right cranial lobe pulmonary vessels occurs commonly in the right lateral view.

Left lateral (A) and right lateral (B) radiographs of an 11-year-old Boxer with a mass in the right middle lung lobe (arrows). The mass is more dorsal on the right lateral view, illustrating the amount of anatomic shift that occurs due to recumbency. Both normal structures and pulmonary lesions are typically more dorsally located when in the dependent lung. This is due to reduced lung expansion in the dependent hemi- thorax. This phenomenon can be used to help assess the lateral- ity of focal pulmonary lesions if they are not seen clearly in ventrodorsal or dorsoventral view. A B Figure 6-20. Right lateral radiograph of an 8-year-old Greyhound, centered on the midventral thorax. The solid white arrows indicate pulmonary vessels associated with the cranio- ventral aspect of the left caudal lung lobe. The hollow black arrows indicate pulmonary vessels associated with the caudal part of the left cranial lung lobe. DORSOVENTRAL VIEW In the dorsoventral view, the patient is in sternal recum- bency and the x-ray beam enters the patient dorsally and exits ventrally (Figure 6-21). The DV view can be difficult to position accurately, particularly in patients with hip osteoarthritis. Symmetrically positioning the forelimbs and ensuring that the head and neck are straight and lined up with the spinal axis increases positioning accu- racy. The collimated field should be such that the entire thorax is imaged. The most common error occurs when the central beam is positioned too far caudally and a radiograph is obtained that includes too much of the abdomen and not enough of the cranial aspect of the thorax. In the DV view, the diaphragm has a domed appearance and extends more cranially than in the VD view, as a result of abdominal pressure. This results in physical contact between the diaphragm and the cardiac silhouette, often leading to the apex of the cardiac silhou- ette being shifted to the left. The extent of cardiac shift to the left is a function of body mass, with more cardiac 196 Atlas of Normal Radiographic Anatomy and Anatomic Variants in the Dog and Cat superimposed over the caudal vena cava, making assess- ment of both the right caudal lobar pulmonary vein and the caudal vena cava difficult (see Figure 6-22). Caudal lobar pulmonary vessels should taper gradually toward the periphery of the thorax. Normal caudal lobe pulmo- nary arteries and veins should be approximately the same size in the dog and cat. With regard to absolute size, each vessel should be approximately the same size as the diameter of the ninth rib in VD or DV radiographs and therefore the summation opacity created by the overlap can be used as a gauge of vessel size (see Figure 6-22, C) Measurement data suggest that 1.2 times the size of the diameter of the ninth rib may be a more accurate upper limit of absolute size. 5 These size-estimation parameters are only a guide and must always be interpreted in concert with other assessments of cardiovascular morphology, especially heart size and shape. displacement occurring in larger dogs.3 The normal cardiac shifting to the left in the DV view is commonly misinterpreted as cardiomegaly. As in small dogs, cardiac shifting to the left in sternal recumbency is minimal in cats. 4 The caudal lobar pulmonary vessels are more con- spicuous in the DV view than in the VD view (Figures 6-22 and 6-23). In sternal recumbency, the caudal lobe pulmonary vessels are more perpendicular to the oncom- ing x-ray beam, which leads to minimal distortion. In addition, in sternal recumbency there is little atelectasis of the caudal lung lobes; this optimal aeration results in increased vessel conspicuity. As noted previously, the left and right caudal lobar pulmonary arteries are located lateral to the bronchus, and the left and right caudal lobar pulmonary veins are medial to the bronchus (see Figure 6-22). Often, the right caudal lobar pulmonary vein is Figure 6-21. A, Dorsoventral radiograph of a 10-year-old Labrador Retriever. The caudal aspect of the heart is in contact with the diaphragm, and the diaphragm has a domed appear- ance. Gas is present in the fundus of the stomach because the fundus is more dorsally located when the dog is in sternal recumbency. The caudal lobe pulmonary vessels are readily visible.

Chapter 6 n The Thorax 199 VENTRODORSAL VIEW In the ventrodorsal view, the patient is in dorsal recum- bency, and the x-ray beam enters the patient ventrally and exits dorsally. The VD view is often easier to position in patients with coxofemoral osteoarthritis because hindlimb extension is not required. Thin patients may benefit from padding under the spine to facilitate positioning. As with the DV view, it is important to position the forelimbs symmetrically and ensure that the neck is straight and the head is directed vertically. Asymmetrically positioning the forelimbs or bending the head and neck are common causes of thoracic malpositioning. The VD view should Figure 6-23. Ventrodorsal radiograph of a 6-year-old Great Dane. The caudal lobe vessels are often more difficult to identify in the ventrodorsal view. The solid white arrows are the caudal vena cava. The solid white arrowheads are probably the right caudal lobar artery. The hollow white arrows are presumed to be the right caudal lobar vein, in this dog, not superimposed over the caudal vena cava. Figure 6-24. Ventrodorsal radiograph of a 9-year-old mixed breed dog. The cardiac silhouette has an elongated appearance, and there is an obvious space between the caudal aspect of the heart and the diaphragm. This is due to decreased abdominal pressure on the dome of the diaphragm when the patient is in dorsal recumbency. This allows better visualization of the acces- sory lung lobe region. Descending aorta Heart Left caudal lobar artery Right caudal lobar artery Right crus of diaphragm Tip of left lung Cranioventral mediastinal reflection Left crus of diaphragm Dome of diaphragm not be attempted in patients with obvious cardiopulmo- nary compromise because decompensation can result due to patient stress. In the VD view, the diaphragmatic crura have a convex appearance and the dome of the diaphragm is usually more caudal, because there is less abdominal pressure on the dome of the diaphragm when compared with a patient in sternal recumbency. This usually results in the presence of aerated lung between the caudal aspect of the heart and the diaphragm, thus allowing better visualization of the accessory lung lobe3 (Figures 6-24 and 6-25). The caudal lobe pulmonary arteries and pulmonary veins are less conspicuous in the VD view than in the DV view because they are at a steep 200 Atlas of Normal Radiographic Anatomy and Anatomic Variants in the Dog and Cat angle with respect to the primary x-ray beam and are therefore distorted. There also is more compression atel- ectasis of the caudal lobes with the subject in dorsal recumbency, which contributes to decreased vessel con- spicuity in the caudal lung lobes (Figure 6-26). The cardiac silhouette is usually more elongated and narrow in the VD view compared with the DV view. It is also less subject to displacement from diaphragmatic contact, leading to the heart typically being more cen- trally located within the thorax. 3 The decision to use anesthesia or sedation for thoracic radiography depends on many factors, including local radiation safety regulations. When general anesthesia is used, modest positive pressure ventilation should be used during the radiographic procedure to achieve optimal lung aeration. Anesthesia should be induced with the patient in sternal recumbency, and the patient should remain in sternal recumbency until lateral radiographs are made. The time between anesthesia induction and radiography should be minimized. Figure 6-26. Horizontal beam radiographs of a 3-year-old Doberman Pinscher. In A, the patient is in sternal recumbency, and in B the patient is in dorsal recumbency. When the patient is in sternal recumbency, the caudodorsal lungs are optimally aerated and the caudal lobar pulmonary artery and veins are more perpendicular to the diverging radiographic beam. These physiologic and positional factors result in increased conspicu- ity of the caudal lobar pulmonary vessels compared with the ventrodorsal view. With the patient in dorsal recumbency (B), as occurs in the ventrodorsal view, there is decreased aeration of the caudodorsal lung due to recumbency-related atelectasis, and the caudal lobar pulmonary vessels are not perpendicular to the primary beam. Consequently, caudal lobar pulmonary vessels are more difficult to see in the ventrodorsal view. The white arrows are the approximate direction of the caudal lobar pulmonary vessels. The black arrows are the approximate direc- tion of the diverging radiographic beam. A Dorsoventral Ventrodorsal B Figure 6-25. Ventrodorsal radiograph of a 6-year-old mixed breed dog. There is an obvious space between the cardiac sil- houette and the diaphragm. A ventrodorsal view allows better evaluation of the accessory lung lobe region. Caudal lobe pul- monary vessels are more difficult to evaluate compared with the dorsoventral view because they are oriented at a steep angle with respect to the primary x-ray beam, and there is more sur- rounding atelectasis due to dependency.

The diaphragm is in contact with the caudal aspect of the heart, and there is only a small triangle of aerated lung between the caudal aspect of the heart, the ventral aspect of the caudal vena cava, and the cranial aspect of the diaphragm (white circle). This triangular region should be evaluated in every lateral radiograph as a way to assess the degree of lung aeration at the time of radiography. Reduced lung aeration results in a diffuse increase in lung opacity and reduced conspicuity of parenchymal disease. In addition, the heart appears larger in the incompletely expanded thoracic cavity, giving the false impression of cardio- megaly. Reduced lung aeration is exacerbated by sedation, obesity, and abdominal disease that results in cranial displacement of the diaphragm, such as significant hepatomegaly or voluminous peri- toneal fluid. B, Left lateral radiograph of a 7-year-old Golden Retriever, at peak inspiration and with optimal lung aeration. The triangular region between the caudal vena cava, heart, and dia- phragm is much larger due to optimal lung aeration. Optimal lung aeration increases the conspicuity of parenchymal disease and increases diagnostic accuracy. A B The interpretation of thoracic radiographs made after prolonged lateral recumbency or anesthesia is compli- cated by pulmonary atelectasis and a secondary medias- tinal shift. The lack of support from the inadequately aerated lung results in a shift of mediastinal structures toward the side with atelectasis (see Figure 6-6). With respect to lateral views, the overall adequacy of lung aera- tion is best assessed by evaluating the size of the triangu- lar region between the caudal aspect of the heart, the ventral aspect of the caudal vena cava, and the dome of the diaphragm. The larger the volume of this triangular region is, the better the overall pulmonary aeration (Figure 6-27). THORACIC WALL Variations in the development of the spine are commonly detected on thoracic radiographs; Chapter 3 discusses these findings. With respect to the ribs and the costal arch, young animals have incompletely calcified costal cartilage, whereas mature animals invariably have more calcifica- tion of costal cartilage and costochondral junctions. The mineralization pattern of the costal cartilages is usually inconsequential, but this is often interpreted incorrectly as abnormal. The mineralized costal cartilages can also confound the assessment of the pulmonary parenchyma and lead to an incorrect assessment of pulmonary disease due to summation (Figure 6-28). 202 Atlas of Normal Radiographic Anatomy and Anatomic Variants in the Dog and Cat Figure 6-28. Lateral (A) and ventrodorsal (B) radiographs of a 9-year-old Golden Retriever. There is extensive new bone proliferation at the costochondral junctions (white arrows indicate only two of many costochondral junctions affected). This is a common occurrence, typically in older patients, and is of no clinical significance. It can, however, complicate interpretation of the ventral aspect of the thorax, and focal regions of new bone formation on the costal cartilages can be misinterpreted as a pulmonary nodule or nodules. Degenerative changes are present in the sternum of this dog. C, Ventrodorsal radiograph of a 12-year-old Labrador Retriever. Exuberant osseous proliferation at the seventh costochondral junction (white arrows) is giving the false impression of a pulmonary nodule. C A B Chapter 6 n The Thorax 203 patients and can be distracting. In addition, especially in VD radiographs, the opacity lateral to skin folds is very radiolucent. When the skin fold is parallel to the lateral margin of the thorax, the reduced opacity lateral to the skin fold can be confused with pneumothorax (Figure 6-30). To make the correct interpretation, it is critical to note that the opacity of the skin fold extends beyond the limit of the thoracic cavity. 6 The sternum comprises a series of eight bones that form the floor of the thoracic cavity. Each segment is joined by short blocks of cartilage, known as the Chondrodystrophoid breeds, typically the Dachshund and the Basset Hound, have enlarged costochondral junc- tions and often an irregular contour to the costal arch. The costochondral junctions are often misinterpreted as pulmonary nodules in the VD or DV views. In addition, the configuration of the costochondral region leads to a peripheral region of increased opacity that can be misin- terpreted as pleural fluid (Figure 6-29). Skin folds can result in well-defined linear opacities that cross and extend beyond the borders of the thoracic cavity; these overlying opacities are quite obvious in some Figure 6-29. Ventrodorsal radiograph of a 6-year-old Basset Hound. Chondrodystrophoid breeds commonly have atypical curvature to the ribs at the costochondral junctions. The ribs deviate medially at the level of the costochondral junctions, which results in a soft tissue margin that can be misinterpreted as pleural effusion on ventrodorsal and dorsoven- tral radiographs. In this dog, this is most noticeable in the caudal aspect of the left hemithorax. 204 Atlas of Normal Radiographic Anatomy and Anatomic Variants in the Dog and Cat Figure 6-30. A, Lateral radiograph of an 11-year-old Golden Retriever. Prominent skin folds associated with the forelimbs are present. In the lateral view, skin-fold position and the rela- tive opacity change observed is more severe when the limbs are not fully extended (white arrowheads). B, Ventrodorsal radiograph of a 9-year-old Mastiff; the apparent opacity of the lung medial to the skin fold (solid white arrows) is increased, and lateral to the skin fold is reduced. The hollow black arrow is a pleural fissure between the right cranial and right middle lobes, and the hollow white arrow is a pleural fissure between the right middle and right caudal lobes. C, Ventrodorsal radiograph of a 10-year-old German Shepherd. The apparent reduction in lung opacity lateral to the skin fold can give the false impression of pneumothorax, par- ticularly when the skin fold closely parallels the thoracic wall (solid white arrows). A radio- graph should have sufficient dynamic range to enable visualization of pulmonary markings throughout the entire thorax. C A B Chapter 6 n The Thorax 205 Figure 6-31. Right lateral radiograph of a 9-year-old German Shepherd. There is marked dorsal displacement of the caudal aspect of the sternum, resulting in mild displacement of the cardiac silhouette. There are only six sternal segments. This anomaly, known as pectus excavatum, is uncommon and is typically not associated with clinical signs. With a severe deformity, cardiac displacement can result in cardiopulmonary dysfunction. intersternebral cartilages, which articulate bilaterally with the first nine rib pairs. Anomalies of the first external segment (manubrium) are uncommon, but variations in the morphology of the last sternebrae (xiphoid pro- cess) are common. Hypoplasia of the xiphoid process or absent caudal sternal segments is often associated with morphologic abnormalities of the caudal thorax and dia- phragm, the most common being pectus excavatum (Figure 6-31). Although pectus excavatum is clearly not normal, it is often not associated with any clinically significant complications. MEDIASTINUM The mediastinum is the space between the right and left pleural sacs, bounded by mediastinal pleura. The medi- astinum extends from the thoracic inlet to the diaphragm. It is fenestrated and typically cannot contain unilateral pleural disease. 7 It also communicates with the neck through the thoracic inlet and with the retroperitoneal space through the aortic hiatus. The mediastinum is generally a midline structure; however, there are three mediastinal reflections where the mediastinum deviates laterally from midline: • Cranioventral mediastinal reflection • Caudoventral mediastinal reflection • Plica vena cava reflection The cranioventral mediastinal reflection is the border between the right cranial lung lobe and the cranial part of the left cranial lobe. The cranial part of the left cranial lobe is the most cranial of all pulmonary tissue in the dog and the cat. At the thoracic inlet, the cranial part of the left cranial lobe crosses the midline to the right. In lateral views, this portion of the left cranial lobe often appears as a sharply contained radiolucent region in the most cranioventral aspect of the thorax. Immediately caudal to the cranial part of the left cranial lobe, the right cranial lobe crosses the midline to the left. The mediastinal pleura between these lobes forms the cranioventral medi- astinal reflection. This reflection is what causes the cranial part of the left cranial lobe to be so distinctly marginated in some lateral views (Figure 6-32). The internal thoracic 206 Atlas of Normal Radiographic Anatomy and Anatomic Variants in the Dog and Cat A B C Figure 6-32. A, Right lateral radiograph of an 8-year-old Great Dane, centered on the cranioventral thorax. The soft tissue opacity outlined by the solid white arrows is the cranioventral mediastinal reflection. The lung, cranial to that outlined by the hollow white arrows, is the cranial most tip, or cupula, of the left cranial lung. The cupula of the left lung is actually located on the right side. B, Ventrodorsal radiograph of a 12-year-old Siberian Husky. The cranioventral mediastinal reflection is delineated by the solid white arrows. Cranially, the tip of the left cranial lung lobe extends to the right side, in the region of the circle. The right lung extends to the left side immediately cranial to the heart. C, Right lateral radiograph of a 7-year-old Golden Retriever. The cra- nioventral mediastinal reflection is not as conspicuous as in A. There is considerable variability in the appearance of this reflection, depend- ing on the amount of mediastinal fat and its relationship with the primary x-ray beam. arteries and veins lie in the cranioventral mediastinal reflection. The caudoventral mediastinal reflection is bounded by the accessory lobe on the right and the left caudal lobe on the left (Figures 6-33 and 6-34). The left aspect of the accessory lobe crosses the midline to the left, pushing the mediastinum to the left and forming the caudoventral mediastinal reflection. The thickness of the caudoventral mediastinal reflection varies considerably, mainly due to the amount of fat it contains. The caudal vena cava extends from the caudal aspect of the cardiac silhouette to the right crus of the dia- phragm and is enveloped within the caudal caval reflec- tion, called the plica vena cava. This mediastinal reflection is not visible radiographically, but it is important to realize that there is a mediastinal reflection around the caudal vena cava (see Figures 6-1, 6-10, 6-17, 6-27 and 6-35). For example, mediastinal fluid can dissect into the plica vena cava and create the appearance of enlargement of the caudal vena cava. The size of the caudal vena cava is extremely variable, depending on the phase of cardiac and respiratory cycles. Normally, the caudal vena cava is less than 11 2 times the width of the descending aorta. 8 Mediastinal organs normally seen radiographically include the heart, trachea, caudal vena cava, aorta, and to varying degrees the esophagus, as discussed in the section on the esophagus in this chapter. The cranial vena cava and cranial mediastinal arteries are not typically visible because they are in contact with each other and with the adjacent esophagus, which reduces conspicuity. The dorsal aspects of the ascending aorta and the descending aorta are usually readily visible. The base of the ascending aorta is usually not visible because it silhouettes with adjacent mediastinal structures. In addition, both the cranial and caudal margins of the cardiac silhouette are visible (Figure 6-36). The proximal portion of the left subclavian artery can sometimes be seen as an arching Chapter 6 n The Thorax 207 Figure 6-33. A, Ventrodorsal radiograph of an 11-year-old German Shepherd. The caudo- ventral mediastinal reflection, delineated by the solid white arrows, is the border between the medial margin of the left caudal lung lobe and the left lateral aspect of the accessory lung lobe, which is a lobe of the right lung. Conspicuity of the caudoventral mediastinal reflection depends on the amount of fat in the reflection, lung aeration, and patient conformation. The hollow white arrows are the cranial margin of the diaphragm. B, Ventrodorsal radiograph of a 6-year-old Great Dane. The caudoventral mediastinal reflection, outlined by the white arrows, is much thinner than in A. This is due to less fat and the plane of the reflection relative to the incident x-ray beam.

Right lateral radiograph of an 8-year-old Greyhound, centered on the heart. The solid white arrows indi- cate the dorsal margin of the descending aorta, and the hollow white arrows indicate the ventral border. The ellipse encompasses the caudal lobe arteries supplying caudal lung lobes and pul- monary veins from the caudal lobes draining into the left atrium. The solid white arrowheads delineate the cranial border of the heart, whereas the black arrowheads indicate the caudal border. The solid white line approximates the border between the left and right sides of the heart. The dashed white line is at the approximate level of the atrioventricular valves. RA LA RV LV soft tissue opacity immediately cranial to the heart and dorsal to the trachea; this occurs most often in large, thin dogs without large amounts of mediastinal fat (Figure 6-37). The width of the cranial mediastinum as seen in the VD or DV view is typically 1 to 2 times the width of a cranial thoracic vertebral body. This wide variation is due to obesity and patient conformation. Brachycephalic breeds, particularly bulldogs, typically have a wide medi- astinum due to an excessive amount of mediastinal fat (Figures 6-38, B, and 6-39, A-B). There are three mediastinal lymphocenters: sternal, cranial and caudal mediastinal, and tracheobronchial. These lymphocenters are not typically visible in a normal patient but become apparent radiographically when moderately enlarged. The sternal lymph nodes are located dorsal to the second sternebral segment. The cranial mediastinal lymph nodes are located in the cranial medi- astinum immediately ventral to the intrathoracic portion of the trachea. The caudal mediastinal lymph nodes sur- round the caudal aspect of the trachea and heart base, and the tracheobronchial lymph nodes surround the carina and origin of the principal bronchi.

A small amount of gas is present in the esophagus (solid black arrow) immediately cranial to this artery. The ventral margin of the thicker dorsal portion of the cranial mediastinum that envelopes the esophagus, trachea, lymph nodes, and cranial mediastinal vessels is delineated by the hollow white arrows. The cranial vena cava, brachiocephalic trunk, and other cranial mediastinal vessels cannot be identified individually because they are in contact with each other and with the esophagus, causing border effacement.

A large amount of fat is present in the cranioventral mediastinum, in the medi- astinum around the heart, and in the caudoventral mediastinal reflection. Although the cranial mediastinum appears wide in the dorsoventral view, mimicking a mass, there is no evidence of a cranial mediastinal mass on the lateral view.

Ventrodorsal radiograph of a 2-month-old English Springer Spaniel. The thymus is delineated by the hollow white arrows. The thymus normally regresses by 6 months of age and should not be radiographically apparent after this time. The thymus is often visible in young dogs (up to 6 months) as a triangle-shaped, soft tissue opacity within the ventral mediastinum, adjacent to the heart (Figure 6-40). TRACHEA AND BRONCHI There is extensive variability in the appearance of the intrathoracic trachea. The trachea is typically slightly to the right of midline on VD and VD views (Figure 6-41) and lies ventral to the esophagus. In most breeds, the intrathoracic trachea diverges from the spine from the level of the thoracic inlet caudally to the carina. In breeds with a dorsoventrally compressed thorax, for example, the Dachshund and Welsh Corgi, the intrathoracic trachea is typically more parallel to the spine but still diverges normally from the spine at the carina (Figure 6-42). With respect to tracheal size, typically, the mean ratio of tracheal diameter to thoracic inlet diameter has been reported to be 0.2 ± 0.03 in nonbrachycephalic breeds. In brachycephalic breeds, excluding Bulldogs, the ratio is 0.16 ± 0.03.9 These figures must be interpreted with caution and should be used only as a guide. The trachea bifurcates at the carina into the left and right principal bronchi. The naming convention of the Chapter 6 n The Thorax 211 Figure 6-41. Dorsoventral view of a 7-year-old American Cocker Spaniel. The solid white arrows delineate the right margin of the trachea, and the hollow white arrows delineate the left margin of the trachea. The trachea is usually at midline or slightly to the right of midline. Sometimes, there is some right- ward deviation of the intrathoracic trachea in normal patients. This also occurs with lymphomegaly and heart base masses. Figure 6-42. Lateral view of a 7-year-old Dachshund. There is less divergence of the trachea from the thoracic spine in lateral radiographs in dogs with a dorsoventrally compressed thorax, but there should still be obvious divergence between the trachea and spine at the carina. Figure 6-43. Dorsoventral radiograph of a 10-year-old Jack Russell Terrier. The bronchial tree has been outlined (white dots). The right lung lobes comprise the right cranial, middle caudal, and accessory lobes. The left lung lobes comprise the cranial and caudal lobes. The left cranial lung lobe is further subdivided into cranial and caudal parts. A microchip is superimposed over the region of the left auricle. Trachea Right principal bronchus Right cranial bronchus Left principal bronchus Cranial part of left cranial bronchus Caudal part of left cranial bronchus Right middle bronchus Right caudal bronchus Accessory bronchus Left caudal bronchus bronchi is based on the origin of each lobar bronchus. The right lung is divided into cranial, middle, caudal, and accessory lobes, all with a bronchus arising from the right principal bronchus. Two lobes, the cranial and caudal, arise from the left principal bronchus. The left cranial lobe bronchus subdivides immediately after arising from the left principal bronchus to supply the cranial and caudal parts of the left cranial lung lobe (Figure 6-43). Overall, the volume of the right lung is greater than the volume of the left. Figure 6-44 outlines the approximate location of the lung lobes. The appearance of the trachea in lateral radiographs can be affected by the position of the patient’s head when radiographed. When the head is flexed during radiogra- phy, the intrathoracic portion of the trachea sometimes deviates dorsally and gives the false impression of a cra- nioventral mediastinal mass (Figure 6-45). In general, the lack of a soft tissue mass effect accounting for the tracheal elevation is sufficient evidence to conclude that the tra- cheal displacement is the result of neck position. If con- firmation is necessary, the lateral radiograph can be repeated with the subject’s neck extended. In both the dog and the cat, the tracheal rings are incomplete dorsally, being connected by the tracheal muscle and anular ligament of the trachea. These struc- tures, combined with the dorsal tracheal mucosa, are collectively known as the dorsal tracheal membrane. Sometimes the dorsal tracheal membrane prolapses 212 Atlas of Normal Radiographic Anatomy and Anatomic Variants in the Dog and Cat Figure 6-44.

Right lateral radiograph of an 8-year-old English Pointer. There is focal dorsal deviation of the intrathoracic trachea. The mediastinum and other structures ventral to the trachea appear normal with no evidence of a space-occupying mass. Dorsal deviation of the trachea, as in this dog, occurs commonly with excessive head flexion during radiography. If there is any doubt whether there is a mediastinal mass causing tracheal elevation, the radio- graph should be repeated with the neck extended. Figure 6-46.

The invaginated redundant trachea membrane is delineated by hollow white arrows. This should not be misdiagnosed as a collapsing trachea. through the incomplete rings into the dorsal aspect of the tracheal lumen. The caudal cervical esophagus, located immediately dorsal to the trachea, can also invaginate into the dorsal tracheal lumen. These invaginations, com- monly referred to as redundancy or sagging of the dorsal tracheal membrane, can result in an increase in opacity in the dorsal aspect of the trachea in the caudal cervical and thoracic inlet regions. Sagging of the dorsal tracheal membrane is usually not a clinically significant entity and should not be confused with tracheal collapse (Figure 6-46). Bulldogs typically have a narrow trachea,10 and mea- surement criteria have been defined to assess the ade- quacy of tracheal diameter in this breed. The trachea to thoracic inlet ratio in this breed has been quantified as 0.13 ± 0.38, indicating that the trachea is typically smaller but the variation in diameter is very large. The smallest ratio that was not associated with clinical signs was 0.09.9 214 Atlas of Normal Radiographic Anatomy and Anatomic Variants in the Dog and Cat Figure 6-47. Lateral radiographs of a 9-year-old Akita (A) and an 11-year-old Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever (B). A small amount of gas is present in the intrathoracic esophagus, cranial to the tracheal bifurcation. This is present commonly in both sedated and fully con- scious patients. Patients under general anesthesia can have a large amount of gas in the esophagus secondary to central nervous system depression. B A ESOPHAGUS The esophagus is dorsal to the trachea and principal bronchi as it courses from the cranial esophageal sphinc- ter to the cardia. It is common for a small amount of gas to be present, normally within the cranial portion of the intrathoracic esophagus (Figure 6-47). Generalized esophageal distension with gas can occur in sedated or anesthetized patients (Figure 6-48). The conspicuity of the esophagus caudal to the cardiac silhouette is variable. Often, the ventral margin of the caudal esophagus is apparent on the lateral views, most commonly when the patient is in left lateral recumbency (Figure 6-49). An ill-defined tubular increase in opacity through the region of the caudal esophagus is sometimes visible, particularly if the esophagus contains a small amount of fluid; this can occur with sedation-associated reflux but is also seen in conscious patients (Figure 6-50). Chapter 6 n The Thorax 215 Figure 6-49. Left lateral radiograph of a 9-year-old Great Dane, centered on the caudal thorax. The ventral border of the esopha- gus is readily visible (solid white arrows). The hollow white arrows outline a curvilinear soft tissue border, which is a fissure between the right middle and right caudal lung lobes. Visualization of this fissure is relatively common and does not automatically indicate the presence of pleural disease. A surgical staple super- imposed over the liver is subsequent to cholecystectomy. An end-on vessel summating with normal structures is present over the esophagus (hollow white arrowhead). Figure 6-50. Lateral radiograph of a 9-year-old Akita. The caudal esophagus contains a small amount of fluid. The ventral border is delineated by the solid white arrows and the dorsal border by the hollow white arrows. The ventral border of the caudal vena cava is delineated by the solid white arrowhead. The caudal vena cava extends into the more caudal right diaphrag- matic crus, typical of a left lateral view. The solid black arrows delineate the dorsal margin of the left caudal lobar pulmonary artery. The left pulmonary artery, located dorsal to the carina, is most commonly seen in the left lateral radiograph. This is prob- ably because it is displaced slightly dorsally in the left lateral view (down anatomy rises), resulting in less superimposition. Figure 6-48. Left lateral radiograph of an 8-year-old Boston Terrier. The patient was under general anesthesia when radio- graphed, and an endotracheal tube can be seen (solid white arrows). The cranial intrathoracic esophagus is dilated with gas (hollow white arrows). The potential for gas distension of the esophagus increases with sedation and general anesthesia. Repeating radiographs when the patient is conscious help dif- ferentiate esophageal disease from the effects of chemical restraint. Brachycephalic breeds often have redundancy of the intrathoracic esophagus, which can manifest as a gas- filled tubular opacity in the cranial mediastinum, ventral to the trachea. This should not be confused with patho- logic esophageal dilation secondary to an esophageal stricture or extrinsic compression associated with a vascular ring anomaly (Figure 6-51), although in some dogs esophageal redundancy may be associated with regurgitation. HEART The cardiac silhouette comprises the heart and pericardial fat. The appearance of the cardiac silhouette depends highly on radiographic positioning. A small degree of patient obliquity can result in significant changes to the appearance of the cardiac silhouette, potentially resulting in an incorrect assessment of chamber enlargement. In the dog, there is a wide range of normal heart size and shape, both within breeds and between breeds. Long, thin dogs have a heart that appears long and thin. Short, 216 Atlas of Normal Radiographic Anatomy and Anatomic Variants in the Dog and Cat squat, or muscular dogs have a heart that appears round and relatively big. Cardiomegaly is often misdiagnosed in these muscular compact dogs (Figure 6-52). Sedation, an expiratory radiograph, or obesity can give a false impression of cardiomegaly because the thorax appears smaller overall with decreased lung expansion. In addi- tion, it is probable that the cardiac silhouette is relatively larger in heavily sedated patients because bradycardia may result in increased cardiac chamber filling. For these reasons, subjective assessment of the size of the heart on radiographs is inaccurate and can be mis- leading. To account for breed variation, a cardiac mea- surement technique, termed vertebral heart score (VHS), has been developed. 11 In this method, the sum of the length and the width of the cardiac silhouette is normal- ized against the length of thoracic vertebrae. Unfortunately, the range of normal VHS values is quite wide. This method may be of limited value in assessing the size of the heart in individual patients; it is probably most useful for longitudinal comparisons in the same patient. An approximation of cardiac chamber location, as seen on lateral views, is outlined in Figure 6-36. In lateral views, the right side of the heart is located cranially in the cardiac silhouette, and the left side is located caudally. The atria are dorsal and the ventricles ventral. Typically, the heart spans no more than 31 2 rib spaces on the lateral view. On DV and VD views, a clock-face analogy is some- times used to describe the various regions of the heart, with the 12 o’clock position being cranial and the 6 o’clock position caudal (Figure 6-53). The clock-face analogy is only a general guide; variations in patient con- formation can affect the appearance and position of the heart within the thorax. Importantly, the thoracic verte- brae are not suitable as landmarks for dividing the heart into left versus right chambers because the interatrial and interventricular septa are oriented at an angle relative to the long axis of the thoracic spine. Overall, the canine heart usually occupies no more than two-thirds of the width of the thorax on a DV or VD view and typically appears more narrow and elongated on a VD view than on a DV view. The left atrium is in the caudodorsocentral aspect of the cardiac silhouette, strad- dled by the principal bronchi (Figure 6-54). Figure 6-51. A, Lateral view of a 5-year-old Pug. A curving tubular gas opacity ventral to the trachea at the level of the second and third ribs (hollow white arrows) is due to redundancy of the cranial intratho- racic esophagus. Lateral view (B) and ventrodorsal view (C) of a 1-year- old Bulldog. The hollow white arrows outline esophageal redundancy. Esophageal redundancy in brachycephalic breeds should not be confused with pathologic esophageal dilation associated with vascular ring anoma- lies, although if severe, esophageal redundancy can result in clinical signs.

The trachea is relatively parallel to the cranial aspect of the thoracic spine, and overall there is an impression of cardiomegaly. This is common in chondrodystrophoid breeds and should not be confused with cardiac disease. The impression of cardiomegaly is often exacerbated by decreased lung aeration and by the use of chemical restraint. Right lateral (C) and ventrodorsal (D) radiographs of a 9-year-old Rottweiler. The sharply delineated radiopaque margin at the cranial aspect of the heart on the left lateral view is due to fat within the mediastinum. The apparent bulge in the region of the pulmonary trunk is a normal anatomic variation, and, in this case, did not reflect pulmonary hypertension or turbulence. 218 Atlas of Normal Radiographic Anatomy and Anatomic Variants in the Dog and Cat E, Ventrodorsal radiograph of a 7-year-old Golden Retriever.

Ventrodorsal radiograph of an 8-year-old Rhodesian Ridgeback. A clock-face analogy is often used as a rule of thumb for locating various cardiac chambers and major vessels in the ventrodorsal view. It should be noted that the pulmonary trunk is on the left side and the thoracic spine is not an accurate reference point for dividing the heart into left versus right sides. The aortic arch is typically in the 12 o’clock position; the pulmonary trunk, otherwise known as the main pulmonary artery (MPA) at the 1 o’clock position; the left auricle at the 2 to 3 o’clock position; and the left ventricle at the 3 to 6 o’clock position. The right ventricle is at the 6 to 9 o’clock position and the right atrium at the 9 to 11 o’clock position.

A cytologically confirmed neoplastic nodule is present in the dorsal aspect of the left caudal lung lobe (hollow white arrows). This is not as conspicuous in the ventrodorsal view (B) due to recumbency-associated atelectasis. A B Figure 6-56. Left lateral radiograph of a 9-year-old Akita. The left caudal lobar artery (dorsal margin delineated by solid white arrows, ventral margin delineated by hollow white arrows) is located dorsal to the carina (hollow white circle) and is usually more easily seen on the left lateral view. The right caudal lobar artery crosses to the right side ventral to the carina and then courses caudodorsally. It can be seen as the poorly defined soft tissue opacity immediately ventral to the carina. As noted earlier, in the DV view the apex of the heart is often shifted to the left and typically contacts the dome of the diaphragm (see Figure 6-7). In some chondrodys- trophoid breeds, the apex of the heart can actually be shifted to the right in the DV view rather than to the left (Figure 6-55). The left caudal lobar pulmonary artery is dorsal to the carina and is usually radiographically apparent, most commonly on the left lateral view. The right caudal lobar pulmonary artery courses ventral to the trachea from its main pulmonary artery origin on the left before turning and coursing caudodorsally. It is an apparent end-on as a circular opacity ventral to the carina that is often mis- interpreted as a pulmonary mass (Figures 6-56, 6-57, A-B and 6-58). The normal feline heart is proportionally smaller than the normal canine heart, and is also more consistent in shape (Figure 6-59). The caudal border of the feline heart should be characterized by a contiguous convex margin, and any significant change in contour suggests the pres- ence of cardiac disease. In older normal cats, the heart often lies at a more oblique angle, with the apex/base axis being more paral- lel with the sternum, and the aortic arch is often more angular in appearance. The angular appearance of the aortic arch can give the false impression of a pulmonary mass in the DV or VD view (Figure 6-60). A geriatric change in the shape of the aorta occurs much less com- monly in dogs, but this does occur and should not be misinterpreted as aortic dilation (Figure 6-61). Obese patients accumulate fat in the mediastinum and the pericardial sac. This can result in an enlarged cardiac silhouette and lead to a misdiagnosis of cardiomegaly (Figure 6-62).

The cardiac sil- houette is nearly parallel with the sternum, and the ascending aorta has an angular appear- ance as it leaves the cardiac silhouette. The trachea at the heart base is abnormally deviated ventrally, which is a manifestation of altered heart position, exacerbated by a small amount of gas in the esophagus. A C B Chapter 6 n The Thorax 225 Figure 6-61. Right lateral (A) and ventrodorsal (B) radiographs of a 9-year-old Siberian Husky. The cardiac silhouette is more oblique than is typical, and there is redundancy of the aorta, which results in a bulge at the cranial aspect of the cardiac silhouette and gives an elongated appearance to the cardiac silhouette in the ventrodorsal view. Similar morphologic changes of the heart can occur with disease of the aortic valve. Clinical findings coupled with an echocardiogram can be required to assess the significance of aortic arch shape changes in dogs versus cats, where they are more common. A B Figure 6-62. Ventrodorsal radiograph of a 10-year-old Domestic Shorthair cat (A) and lateral radiograph of an 8-year-old Doberman Pinscher (B). In A, the cardiac silhouette is enlarged; on close examination, however, the peripheral border is poorly defined, and there is an indistinct transition of radiographic opacity from the center of the cardiac silhouette peripher- ally. This is due to the presence of fat in the mediastinum surrounding the heart. The solid white arrows delineate the right margin of the cardiac silhouette. The hollow white arrows indi- cate the peripheral margin of the cardiac silhouette. The opacity between the two is pericardial fat. There is also a large amount of fat in the cranial mediastinum and caudoventral medias- tinal reflection (black arrowheads). In B, a fat opacity is present between the ventral aspect of the heart, the diaphragm, and the sternum. The fat opacity extends along the cranial border of the heart and is due to fat in the ventral aspect of the pericardial sac. A B 226 Atlas of Normal Radiographic Anatomy and Anatomic Variants in the Dog and Cat Figure 6-63. Dorsoventral view of a 3-year-old Doberman Pinscher. The heart is positioned more vertically in deep-chested dogs, giving it a more rounded appearance in the dorsoventral view. Figure 6-64. Left lateral radiograph of an 8-year-old mixed breed dog. The caudal border of the seventh rib (solid white arrows) is contiguous with the caudal border of the heart (hollow white arrows), giving the false impression of left atrium enlargement. 6 7 Figure 6-65. Left lateral radiograph of an 11-year-old Greyhound. Linear mineralization, not associated with the pulmonary vascula- ture, is superimposed over the region of the aortic bulb (solid white arrows). This is likely idiopathic aortic bulb/root mineralization. This is not usually associated with an endocrinopathy, and patients are asymptomatic. The mineralization is typically in the fourth intercostal space in the craniodorsal quadrant of the cardiac silhouette. In dogs with a deep thorax, the heart is often more vertical in location, which results in a more rounded overall appearance in DV and VD views (Figure 6-63). A summation opacity created by a rib overlapping the caudal margin of the heart can give the false impres- sion of left atrial enlargement, because the eye is drawn to the caudal border of the rib as it extends dorsally (Figure 6-64). Infrequently, dystrophic mineralization of the aortic root occurs, apparent as a sharp linear mineral opacity in the region of the aortic outflow tract. This mineralization is usually conspicuous only on the lateral view and is considered a clinically insignificant incidental finding 12 (Figure 6-65). Chapter 6 n The Thorax 227 LUNG The lung comprises the following: connective tissue, the bronchial tree and terminal airspaces, and afferent and efferent vessels. Radiographically, it is normal to see pul- monary vessels, bronchi, and some interstitial markings. The interstitial markings should be visible to the lung periphery (Figure 6-66). Failure to see lung extending to the thoracic wall suggests the presence of either pneumo- thorax or radiographic overexposure. The skin-fold effect, described previously, is also important to recognize because it can also cause the impression of failure of the lung to extend to the thoracic wall. Determining when the conspicuity of interstitial mark- ings exceeds normal limits is imprecise, and even experi- enced radiologists cannot do this consistently. It is most important to be familiar with the patient variables and the technical factors that result in an artifactual increase in lung opacity. One of the most common mistakes is failure to realize that overall pulmonary opacity will always be greater in lateral radiographs than in DV or VD radiographs because of the greater amount of atelectasis that occurs in lateral recumbency. It is very common for the normally increased opacity occurring in lateral views to be misinterpreted as pulmonary disease, particularly in sedated patients (see Figure 6-3). Bronchi appear as peripherally tapering hollow tubes with thin walls, whereas pulmonary vessels appear as soft tissue tubular structures that attenuate toward the periphery. Vessels and airways are seen end-on and side-on throughout the lung parenchyma. End-on pul- monary vessels appear as small nodules and end-on bronchi appear as small ring shadows. Bronchial and interstitial markings can develop increased conspicuity as the patient matures. Unfortunately, with many diseases, there is also a gradual transition from normal to diffuse pulmonary disease, which also complicates assessment of the lung. The most common reason for poor visualization of the normal interstitial markings extending to the periph- ery of the thorax is overexposure with film-screen systems and inappropriate image processing in digital systems. The most common reasons for a generalized increase in unstructured lung opacity are decreased aeration or underexposure or poor development when using a film- screen system. Decreased aeration is often due to atelec- tasis occurring in lateral recumbency but also occurs when the image is acquired at peak expiration (see Figure 6-3). The amount of tissue in the thoracic wall also has a dramatic effect on the overall opacity of the lung and, therefore, the conspicuity of interstitial markings. In subjects with a high body mass index, there is a tendency to misdiagnose the resulting generalized increased pul- monary opacity caused by the superimposed soft tissue as interstitial lung disease. Subjects that have undergone forelimb amputation provide a good example of this phe- nomenon. The forelimb amputation results in a decrease in lung opacity in the ipsilateral hemithorax due to loss of superimposed soft tissue resulting from the amputa- tion itself and subsequent disuse atrophy of remaining soft tissue in the shoulder region on the side of the ampu- tation. This reduction in the amount of superimposed soft tissue leads to a discrepancy in pulmonary opacity between sides. The more opaque lung on the side oppo- site the amputation can be misinterpreted as diseased (Figure 6-67). Overlapping of normal intrathoracic structures with the creation of summation opacities can give the false impression of parenchymal disease, especially misdiag- nosis of pulmonary nodules. This is particularly common when a pulmonary vessel is superimposed on a rib, creat- ing a very obvious summation opacity that is misinter- preted as a pulmonary nodule (Figure 6-68). In addition, extrathoracic structures (particularly nipples, dermal masses, or even ectoparasites) can result in artifacts that can be misinterpreted as parenchymal nodules (Figure 6-69). It is imperative that these findings are fully assessed with an orthogonal view, a detailed clinical examination, and, in some instances, the application of a radiopaque marker on a body wall structure thought to be the source of a possible pulmonary nodule (Figure 6-70). Visualization of an end-on pulmonary vessel is also often misinterpreted as a lung nodule. Fortunately, the distinction between an end-on vessel and a pulmonary nodule is usually easy to make. First, end-on pulmonary vessels often have a diameter smaller than the diameter required for visualization of a solitary pulmonary nodule. End-on pulmonary vessels with a diameter in the 2- to 3-mm range can be seen radiographically. A solitary soft tissue nodule with a diameter less than approximately 5 mm, however, usually is not visible because it does not absorb an adequate number of x-rays. End-on pulmonary vessels can be seen at such a small diameter because they are cylindrical and have depth when viewed end-on. This depth results in sufficient x-ray absorption for visualiza- tion. Second, end-on pulmonary vessels usually have a tail, which is an adjacent linear opacity created by a portion of the vessel that has turned and is being struck side-on by the x-ray beam rather than end-on (Figure 6-71). Third, due to the normal association between pul- monary vessels and airways, end-on pulmonary vessels are usually directly adjacent to an end-on bronchus (see Figure 6-66, C-D). The term fissure is used to describe a radiopaque linear region between adjacent lung lobes. Fissures are usually not apparent in the normal patient, but they do become apparent when pleural fluid tracks between lung lobes. Occasionally, thin radiopaque lines reflecting the inter- face between two adjacent lung lobes can be seen in 228 Atlas of Normal Radiographic Anatomy and Anatomic Variants in the Dog and Cat A B C D normal subjects (Figure 6-72). Increased conspicuity of this border in the absence of pleural fluid can be an age- related change due to mild pleural fibrosis. Occasionally, a linear margin of increased opacity is present between right cranial and right middle lung lobes, particularly in well-conditioned patients. This is fat within a redundant mediastinal refection (Figure 6-73) and if present in isolation, should not be confused with a pleural fissure line that might otherwise indicate pleural fluid. For normal pleural fissures to be apparent radio- graphically, the x-ray beam must be exactly parallel to the lung border. This occurs commonly at the junction between the right middle and right caudal lung lobe, resulting in a curvilinear soft tissue opacity superimposed over the caudal margin of the heart in lateral radiographs (Figure 6-74). Chapter 6 n The Thorax 229 Figure 6-66. Normal pulmonar parenchyma. Pulmonary vessels are branching tubular soft tissue opacities emanating from the hilus. They become progressively smaller toward the periphery. Bronchi are hollow, thin-walled tubular structures that are closely associated with pulmonary vessels. Bronchi are easier to identify closer to the hilus, where they are larger. Bronchi become progressively more mineralized with age, and this is apparent radiographi- cally. A, Left lateral radiograph of a 7-year-old Greyhound. B, Ventrodorsal radiograph of an 11-year-old German Shepherd. C, Left lateral radiograph of a 12-year-old Siberian Husky, centered on the cranial lobe pulmonary vessels. The solid white arrow is the ventral border of the right cranial lobe pulmonary vein. The hollow white arrow is a branch of the right cranial lobe pulmonary vein. The solid white arrowheads are outlining a circular structure superim- posed on the branch of the right cranial lobar pulmonary vein. This circular structure reflects an additional branch emanating from that vessel, which is projected end on. The apparent increased opacity of this vessel compared with other pulmonary vessels is because the end-on vessel has depth in the vertical plane resulting in increased x-ray attenuation; that is, the structure is actually cylindrical and not spherical, as a nodule would be. This is a common occurrence, and an end-on vessel should not be confused with a pulmonary nodule. The solid black arrow is the ventral wall of the right cranial lobe bronchus. The black arrowhead is the ventral border of the right cranial lobe pulmonary artery. D, Left lateral radiograph of a 10-year-old mixed breed dog, centered on the cranioventral thorax. Peripherally, the right cranial lobe pulmonary artery, bronchus, and right cranial lobe pulmonary vein have turned and become oriented end on with the x-ray beam. The hollow white arrow is the pulmonary vein, the solid white arrow is the pulmonary artery, and the black arrowhead is the bronchus. Figure 6-67. Ventrodorsal radiograph of a 9-year-old Labrador Retriever. The right forelimb has been amputated. There is a relative reduction in lung opacity in the cranioventral aspect of the right hemithorax due to a lack of superimposition of the forelimb and secondary muscle atrophy. Figure 6-68. Ventrodorsal radiograph of an 8-year-old German Shepherd. There is a focus of increased opacity at the level of a costochondral junction (solid white arrowhead). This has the appearance of a pulmonary nodule but is due to a focus of mineralization and remodeling at the costochondral junction. This is a common finding. 230 Atlas of Normal Radiographic Anatomy and Anatomic Variants in the Dog and Cat A B C D Figure 6-69.

In D, the nodule is readily apparent on the left thoracic wall (solid white arrowheads). Clinical inspection confirmed the presence of an engorged tick.

The mass appears well-defined and, based on this view, is within the thoracic cavity (solid white arrowheads). However, on the ventrodorsal view, the mass is readily apparent on the right thoracic wall (solid white arrowheads). E F Figure 6-70. A, Ventrodorsal radiograph of a 13-year-old mixed breed dog. A soft tissue nodule is present in the right fifth intercostal space (solid white arrowheads). An important differential is metastatic lung disease. This was not identified in the lateral views, and a small cutaneous nodule was identified on clinical examination. A small radiopaque bead was placed on the nodule, and the patient was re-radiographed (B). The focal increased opacity seen radiographically was confirmed to be a cutaneous nodule. A B Figure 6-69, cont’d. 232 Atlas of Normal Radiographic Anatomy and Anatomic Variants in the Dog and Cat A B C Figure 6-71. A, A 9-year-old Golden Retriever. The focus of increased opacity (solid white arrow) is an end-on vessel. “End-on” pulmonary vessels have increased opacity because they have increased depth and, therefore, increased attenuation when struck end-on by the x-ray beam. Additionally, end-on pulmonary vessels have a “tail” caused by the adjacent part of the vessel being imaged “side-on.” These findings help differentiate pulmonary vessels from small pulmonary nodules. Tails associated with the increased opacity are readily apparent. B, A 6-year-old Great Dane. An end-on vessel is summating with a rib and vessel (solid white arrow). The superimposed rib is resulting in increased opacity and making the vessel more conspicuous. C, The same patient as in B; an end-on vessel (solid white arrow) has increased conspicuity and a “tail” is readily evident. Chapter 6 n The Thorax 233 Figure 6-72. Dorsoventral radiograph of a 12-year-old mixed breed dog. A thin radiopaque line is seen in the right caudolateral aspect of the thorax (solid white arrowheads). This is a fissure line and reflects the boundary between the caudal aspect of the right middle lung lobe and cranial aspect of the right caudal lung lobe. It is common to see thin pleural fissure lines in normal patients. Visualization of the margin is probably a manifestation of mild pleural thickening or opportunistic alignment of the x-ray beam with the plane of the fissure. Separation between lobes occurs with the presence of pleural fluid and is an important differential. Figure 6-73. Ventrodorsal (A) and right lateral (B) radiographs of a 10-year-old mixed breed dog. The curving margin of increased opacity outlined by the hollow white arrows is fat between the right cranial and middle lung lobes, within a redundant mediastinal fold. In the right lateral view, the fat is silhouetting with the cranial border of the heart. This should not be confused with pleural fluid or collapse of the right middle lung lobe. BA 234 Atlas of Normal Radiographic Anatomy and Anatomic Variants in the Dog and Cat Figure 6-74. A, Left lateral radiograph of a 12-year-old Siberian Husky. B, A left lateral radiograph of a 10-year-old Labrador Retriever. The hollow white arrows outline the fissure between the caudal aspect of the right middle lung lobe and the cranial aspect of the right caudal lung lobe. This is commonly observed in the left lateral view, particularly when there is poor lung aeration. This fissure should not be confused with pleural fluid. It is radiographi- cally apparent because the x-ray beam strikes the caudal border of the lung lobe end on. Skin folds arising from the axilla are apparent along the ventral aspect of the image. BA Pulmonary osseous metaplasia, also termed pulmonary heterotopic bone or pulmonary osteomas, is a benign aging change encountered commonly in normal patients. Type I pneumocytes can produce osteoid; in some dogs this manifests as small punctate mineral opacities scattered throughout the lung parenchyma. This anomaly can occur in any breed but is most commonly seen in collies. These benign mineralized foci must not be confused with metastasis. Mineralized foci are typically more opaque than a vessel of the same size and more radio- graphically apparent than a soft tissue nodule of similar size (Figure 6-75). Because of their mineralization, pulmonary osteomas can be detected at a very small size, on the order of 1 or 2 mm. A soft tissue nodule in the lung, on the other hand, must reach a diameter of approx- imately 5 mm to be radiographically detectable. Dolichocephalic breeds have a taller and narrower thoracic cavity compared with mesaticephalic and brachycephalic breeds. This can result in less cardioster- nal contact. When the lungs are well aerated, there may actually be lung between the ventral aspect of the heart and the sternum in lateral views. The radiolucent lung and the dorsal heart positioning are often misinterpreted as evidence of pneumothorax (Figure 6-76). Chapter 6 n The Thorax 235 Figure 6-75. Left lateral (A) and magnified (B) views of an 11-year-old Great Pyrenees with pulmonary osseous metaplasia, which creates multiple punctate opacities throughout all lung lobes. The opacities are small and more radiopaque than pulmonary vessels of a similar size because they are mineralized. Pulmonary osseous metaplasia is common in older patients, especially in collie-type breeds. A sharply marginated linear soft tissue opacity superimposed over the caudal aspect of the heart most likely reflects the border between the caudal aspect of the right middle lung lobe and the cranial aspect of the right caudal lung lobe. It is radio- graphically apparent because the x-ray beam strikes the caudal border of the lung lobe end on. In A, spinal degenerative changes are present with endplate sclerosis, disc space collapse, and ventral spondylosis. The ventral border of the esophagus is also visible in A. A B Figure 6-76. Left lateral radiograph of a 12-year-old Golden Retriever. The heart appears dorsally displaced from the sternum, and an important differ- ential is pneumothorax. However, lung markings extend to the periphery of the thorax, and the opacity ventral to the heart is intermediate between gas and soft tissue (i.e., fat). This patient did not have pneumothorax, and the changes present are a manifestation of patient conformation. 236 Atlas of Normal Radiographic Anatomy and Anatomic Variants in the Dog and Cat Figure 6-77. Lateral radiograph of a 12-year-old mixed breed dog. There are mildly increased bronchial markings, a common finding in older patients. The bronchi are the thin linear opaci- ties adjacent to the pulmonary vasculature and are visible due to wall mineralization. The clinical significance of this must be interpreted in light of clinical signs. It is common to see such changes in older asymptomatic patients. Figure 6-78. Lateral views of normal 1-year-old (A) and normal 7-year-old (B) Domestic Shorthair cat. Cats have fewer bronchial and interstitial markings compared with dogs. An increase in bronchial markings is more typically associated with respiratory disease in cats. Overall, younger cats (A) usually have fewer bronchial markings than older cats (B) for the same reason as in dogs, but the changes are much less common or pronounced. A B Older dogs typically have more conspicuous bronchial markings compared with younger patients. The relative significance of increased bronchial markings must be interpreted in light of clinical signs (Figure 6-77). Often, this increased bronchial visualization is due to mild wall mineralization that could be a consequence of chronic low-grade airway inflammation that is no longer causing clinical signs. Cats typically have fewer bronchial markings than dogs. The presence of bronchial markings in a cat to the extent that would be considered normal in a dog is usually indicative of airway disease (Figure 6-78). Chapter 6 n The Thorax 237 Figure 6-79. Right lateral view of a 9-year-old mixed breed cat. The caudodorsal lung border diverges from the thoracic spine. This is typical in cats and is associated with the relatively increased mass of the hypaxial musculature in the cat versus the dog. This should not be confused with pleural effusion. The dorsocaudal tip of the lung lobes is typically at the level of T12 or T13-L1, depending on patient conformation and degree of lung aeration. aeration. The caudodorsal lung border in cats is typically more ventral when compared with dogs (Figure 6-79), a feature sometimes accentuated in outdoor cats compared with indoor sessile cats. This is possibly associated with increased hypaxial muscle mass in physically active cats and should not be confused with pleural effusion. Mild asymmetry of the diaphragm is common as a normal variant and is most apparent on the VD view (Figure 6-80). It is impossible to determine the signifi- cance of such asymmetry without dynamic imaging, because diaphragmatic palsy, although less common, can also lead to this appearance in thoracic radiographs. A sliding hiatal hernia is occasionally visible as an ill- defined mass effect in the dorsocentral aspect of the thorax, at the level of the esophageal hiatus. Hiatal hernias, which are often clinically insignificant, are more often seen in the left lateral view, most likely due to mechanical pressure on the stomach from compression in the dependent hemiabdomen. A hiatal hernia can be confused with a pulmonary or mediastinal mass. Typically, however, the hiatal hernia is not present on every view of a three-view thoracic study (Figure 6-81). In some instances, it may be necessary to use more spe- cialized imaging, such as a barium gastrogram or com- puted tomography (CT) imaging, to make the correct interpretation. DIAPHRAGM The diaphragm is the musculotendinous division between the thoracic and abdominal cavities. Radiographically, it comprises a ventral dome and two dorsally located crura (see Figures 6-10, A-B; 6-16, A-B; and 6-17). As described earlier, the position of the diaphragm is affected by recumbency and phase of respiration. In a DV view, the dome of the diaphragm is typically more cranial and rounded, which results in increased cardiac contact with subsequent cardiac displacement as already discussed (see Figure 6-21, A-B). The crura of the diaphragm are more readily apparent in a VD view compared with a DV view (see Figure 6-24). The diaphragm has three normal openings, each called a hiatus. Dorsally, the aortic hiatus provides for passage of the aorta and para-aortic vessels into the retroperito- neal space; the esophageal hiatus allows passage of the esophagus and vagal nerves, and the caval hiatus allows passage of the caudal vena cava from the abdomen into the right atrium. The crura of the diaphragm extend dor- socaudally to attach to the midlumbar vertebral bodies. The position of the diaphragm is dramatically affected by pulmonary aeration or hyperinflation. Typically, the caudodorsal lung tip extends to the level of T11 to T12, but this depends on patient conformation and lung 238 Atlas of Normal Radiographic Anatomy and Anatomic Variants in the Dog and Cat Figure 6-81. Left lateral (A), right lateral (B), and ventrodorsal (C) radiographs of a 6-year- old Siamese cat. There is an ill-defined soft tissue mass effect within the caudodorsal thorax superimposed over the cranial border of the diaphragm at approximately the level of the esophageal hiatus (solid white arrows in A and B). The mass effect is not apparent in the ven- trodorsal view. This was confirmed to be an asymptomatic sliding hiatal hernia. Such a finding could easily be confused with a pulmonary or mediastinal mass. A B C Figure 6-80. Ventrodorsal radiograph of an 8-year-old Rhodesian Ridgeback. There is asymmetry of the diaphragm, with the right diaphragmatic crus being more cranial than the left. Mild diaphrag- matic asymmetry is common in normal patients. An important differential is diaphragmatic paralysis or decreased aeration of the ipsilateral lung. Abdominal masses might also cause cranial dis- placement of the diaphragm as a result of increased intra-abdominal pressure. Chapter 6 n The Thorax 239 A B C Diaphragmatic eventration is characterized by regional failure of the muscular or tendinous portion of the diaphragm, without complete disruption. This can be congenital, acquired (as with trauma, such as an incom- plete tear), or associated with regional neurogenic dys- function. The diaphragmatic defect causes the affected portion of the diaphragm to be located more cranially than normal, and its appearance often changes with patient position. The anomaly can be very focal and can give the impression of a caudal thoracic or diaphrag- matic mass (Figure 6-82). As with hiatal hernia, more specialized imaging (such as ultrasonography, CT, or Figure 6-82. Right lateral (A), ventrodorsal (B), and dorsoventral (C) radiographs of an 11-year-old Domestic Shorthair cat. There is a focal bulge, or mass effect, arising from the left aspect of the diaphragm in the lateral view extending into the thoracic cavity (solid white arrows). This abnormality appears as a bulge of the left crus of the diaphragm on the ventrodorsal view (solid white arrows). The opacity is not apparent on the dorsoventral view (C), likely because the eventration has resolved dynamically as a result of less diaphragmatic pressure due to altered positioning. This was con- firmed an incidental diaphragmatic eventration by other imaging. Important differentials are a caudally located pulmonary mass or a diaphragmatic mass. positive-contrast peritoneography) might be necessary to make the correct interpretation. Occasionally, the caudoventral aspect of the thorax is characterized by increased opacity ventral to the caudal vena cava, the dorsal margin of which is defined by a relatively sharp linear border that is nearly parallel to the ventral border of the caudal vena cava. This is not a pleural fissure line and is consistent with a mesothelial remnant associated with failure of closure of the embryo- logic division between the thoracic and abdominal cavi- ties. Depending on the patency of this remnant, it can provide a route for abdominal organs to migrate into the 240 Atlas of Normal Radiographic Anatomy and Anatomic Variants in the Dog and Cat Figure 6-83.

The dorsal margin of this opacity has been highlighted in A1 with a white dotted line. This reflects the dorsal margin of a mesothelial remnant. There may be a reduction in the number of sternebrae, especially absence of the xiphoid, in combination with this anomaly but that was not present in this cat. A A1 peritoneal sac, as in peritoneopericardial diaphragmatic hernia (Figure 6-83). A reduction in number of sterne- brae, especially the xiphoid, can accompany this anomaly. REFERENCES 1.
