Infrequently, there is incomplete ossification at the distal aspect of the canine acromion (Figure 4-6). In the dog, the clavicle is rudimentary, appearing as a very small opacity in the body of the brachiocephalicus muscle. In the cat, however, the clavicle is much more developed and is usually palpable clinically (Figures 4-7 and 4-8). In the dog, the clavicular remnant is seen only in ventrodorsal (or dorsoventral) radiographs; in the cat, the clavicle can be seen in both lateral and ventrodorsal (or dorsoventral) radiographs. Particularly when imaging one scapula or shoulder joint, there is a propensity to abduct the shoulder joint. This can give the false impres- sion of disruption to the medial compartment of the joint (see Figure 4-8, A). In poorly positioned feline radio- graphs, the appearance of clavicles could be confused with an esophageal foreign object. Lateral radiographs of the scapula and shoulder joint are best acquired with the limb of interest placed closest to the x-ray table and pulled craniodistally while the head and neck are extended dorsally and the uppermost limb pulled caudally. The orthogonal view of the scapula and shoulder is best acquired in a caudal-to-cranial direction (Cd-Cr) with the patient in dorsal recumbency and the limb extended cranially (see Figures 4-1 and 4-2). Acquiring lateral and oblique radiographs of the scapula without superimposition of the spine is challeng- ing. One method is to place the subject in lateral recum- bency with the limb of interest uppermost (nondependent). The head and neck are flexed, and the elbow is directed dorsally to force the scapula dorsal to the cranial aspect of the thoracic spine. This results in a slightly oblique There is no direct osseous connection between the fore- limbs and axial skeleton as occurs in the hindlimbs. The forelimbs support the trunk by a muscular sling known as the pectoral girdle, which extends from the medial aspect of the scapulae ventrally to the thoracic wall and sternum. THE SCAPULA AND BRACHIUM The scapula is the large flat bone of the shoulder (Figures 4-1 and 4-2). Because the trunk is supported by the pec- toral girdle, which attaches to the scapulae, the normal position of each scapula with respect to the vertebral column varies considerably. The flat surface of the scapula is divided nearly equally into cranial and caudal halves by a protruding spine, which is more developed distally than proximally. The most distal aspect of the spine of the scapula is known as the acromion (see Figures 4-1 and 4-2). Distally, the scapular blade narrows to form a neck, the cranial margin of which is the scapular notch. The scapular notch extends into the glenoid cavity and articu- lates with the proximal humerus to form the scapulo- humeral or shoulder joint (Figure 4-3). The supraglenoid tubercle, the site of origin of the biceps muscle, and the coracoid process are located at the most cranial aspect of the glenoid cavity. In the cat, the coracoid process is more developed than in the dog, and the acromion has a hamate process and a suprahamate process (Figure 4-4). Occasionally, a separate ossification center is visible radiographically at the caudal aspect of the glenoid cavity (Figure 4-5). This can be difficult to differentiate from an Figure 4-1.

The caudal aspect of the cervical spine, the cranial aspect of the thoracic spine, and the contralateral right scapula are all superimposed on regions of the left scapula.

Caudocranial view of the distal aspect of the right scapula and shoulder joint of a 2-year-old Domestic Shorthair cat. The forelimb has been slightly abducted. This abduc- tion causes the medial aspect of the joint to be increased in width; this is often misinterpreted as subluxation, or shoulder instability, but this is a normal finding.

An osseous body at the caudal aspect of the glenoid cavity (white arrow) is considered an uncommonly occurring separate center of ossification. It is often difficult to differentiate between this apparent ossification anomaly and an osteophyte. Chapter 4 n The Thoracic Limb 95 Figure 4-6.

B C A Chapter 4 n The Thoracic Limb 97 view of the scapula, but without superimposition of the cervical and thoracic spine (Figure 4-9). The shoulder joint is the articulation between the glenoid cavity of the scapula and the humeral head. Because shoulder lameness is common, the shoulder is one of the most frequently radiographed joints. Lateral views are best acquired as previously described for the lateral view of the scapula (Figure 4-10). A common fault is failure to pull the shoulder far enough cranially, result- ing in superimposition of the proximal aspect of the humerus on the manubrium. This superimposition pre- vents accurate assessment of the humeral head (see Figure 4-10). When the limb is pulled craniodistally, the shoul- der joint is usually cranioventral to the ventral aspect of the cervical trachea. Alternatively, intentionally using less traction so that the humeral head is superimposed on the lumen of the caudal aspect of the cervical trachea may facilitate the evaluation of intra-articular structures Figure 4-9. Oblique lateral view of the right scapula of a 1-year-old mixed breed dog. The patient is in lateral recumbency with the scapula of interest up (nondependent). The nondependent brachium is pushed dorsally while the neck is flexed. This elimi- nates superimposition of the scapula and vertebrae, and, in conjunction with the caudocranial (or craniocaudal) view, this view is useful in assessing body fractures. Figure 4-10. Well-positioned lateral view (A) of the shoulder joint of a 7-year-old Labrador Retriever. The shoulder is cranial and distal to the trachea and sternum, and the contralateral limb has been retracted caudally. This positioning allows optimal radiographic evaluation. In B, the shoulder is not pulled sufficiently cranially, and there is superimposition of the manubrium and the caudal aspect of the humeral head.

Lateral view of the shoulder joint of a 5-year-old Rottweiler. The forelimb has not been distracted maximally, and a portion of the humeral head is superimposed over the trachea. This sometimes provides additional contrast when evaluating the joint, but the portion of the humeral head that is superimposed on the trachea varies, creating inconsis- tency that can complicate image interpretation.

This can complicate radiographic interpretation. completely distant from the tracheal lumen. This is par- ticularly true if the patient is under general anesthesia, because superimposition of the endotracheal tube over the joint will also compromise radiographic assessment (Figure 4-12). because of the additional contrast provided by the air in the trachea (Figure 4-11). However, it is impossible to control exactly which portion of the humeral head will be superimposed on the trachea and, in general, lateral radiographs should be made with the shoulder Chapter 4 n The Thoracic Limb 99 Figure 4-13. Lateral view (A) of the shoulder of a 9-month-old St. Bernard. This is the standard view when assessing for humeral head osteochondrosis. Lesions on the caudomedial or caudolateral aspect of the humeral head are often more easily detected by rotating the forelimb medially and laterally. With the patient in lateral recumbency, as for the lateral view, the dorsum of the forelimb is rotated laterally, as in B. This profiles the caudolateral aspect of the humeral head. When the dorsum of the limb is rotated medially, as in C, the caudo- medial aspect of the humeral head is profiled. A B C Osteochondrosis is a common disorder of the canine shoulder. Often the changes created by this abnormality are visible on conventional lateral views of the shoulder, where they are struck tangentially by the x-ray beam. However, sometimes the osteochondrosis lesion is located slightly medial to the true caudal aspect of the humeral head and is not struck tangentially by the x-ray beam. In this instance, additional views of the shoulder joint are needed to provide a more global assessment of the caudal aspect of the humeral head. With the patient in lateral recumbency as for the lateral view, the dorsum of the forelimb is rotated laterally (supination) to create the view in Figure 4-13, B (Md-LCrO). This supination pro- files the caudolateral aspect of the humeral head. When 100 Atlas of Normal Radiographic Anatomy and Anatomic Variants in the Dog and Cat assessing the caudomedial aspect of the humeral head for medially located osteochrondrosis lesions, the dorsum of the limb is rotated medially as in Figure 4-13, C (prona- tion). In this position, the caudomedial aspect of the humeral head is profiled (Mr-LCdO). The biceps tendon originates at the supraglenoid tubercle of the scapula and extends between the larger laterally located greater tubercle and the smaller medially located lesser tubercle (see Figure 4-14). In addition to a lateral and caudocranial view, a cranioproximal-to- craniodistal view of the cranial aspect of the humerus allows assessment of the biceps groove for changes that may develop secondary to biceps tenosynovitis or supra- spinatus insertionopathy (Figure 4-15). This view is acquired by placing the patient in sternal recumbency on the x-ray table with the shoulders flexed and the fore- limbs adjacent to the thoracic cage. The cassette or imaging plate is placed in the crook of the elbow and the x-ray beam directed vertically and centered on the proxi- mal humerus. Figure 4-14. Cranial view of a three-dimensional (3-D) volume rendered CT of a canine shoulder joint. The symbol # is the greater tubercle, * is the bicipital groove, + is the lesser tubercle, @ is the supraglenoid tubercle. The biceps tendon originates from the supraglenoid tubercle and extends between the greater and lesser tubercles in the bicipital groove. The bicipital bursa, which is contiguous with the shoulder joint, provides lubrication for the tendon as it courses through the bicipital groove. # + @ * Figure 4-15. Cranioproximal-craniodistal oblique view profil- ing the greater and lesser tubercles in a 12-month-old Labrador Retriever. The biceps tendon is positioned in the groove between these two structures. This view is used in the assessment of secondary changes occurring as a consequence of bicipital tenosynovitis. Chapter 4 n The Thoracic Limb 101 Figure 4-16. Lateral view of the proximal aspect of the humerus in an 8-year-old Greyhound. There is lucency at the base of the greater tubercle, delineated by the solid white arrows. This is rela- tively common. Although the cause has not been completely characterized, it might reflect a retained cartilage core, which can give the false impression of an aggressive lesion. Occasionally, an ill-defined lucency can be seen associ- ated with the base of the greater tubercle (Figure 4-16). The origin of this has not been completely characterized; it may reflect a retained cartilage core during early devel- opment. There are small vascular channels in this region and their presence probably contributes to the reduction in opacity present radiographically. Whether this is clini- cally significant is debated but most likely represents a normal variant. The greater and lesser tubercles and the humeral head together make up the proximal humeral epiphysis. The associated physis is typically closed in dogs by 12 to 18 months, but the timing of fusion of the cranial aspect of the proximal humeral physis is variable. During the process of fusion, this area of the physis can look quite irregular and should not be confused with an aggressive lesion or a physeal fracture (Figure 4-17). In addition, the supraglenoid tubercle of the scapula develops as a sepa- rate ossification center, typically closing in the dog at 4 to 7 months (Figure 4-18). Figure 4-17. Lateral view (A) and caudocranial view (B) of the right shoulder of an 1112-month-old Labrador Retriever. The solid white arrow is the cranial margin of the proximal humeral physis. The zone of incomplete mineralization is normal and should not be confused with an aggressive process. The hollow white arrowheads are the caudal margin of the proximal humeral physis.

Although compared with Figure 4-7, A, the lucency at the cranial aspect of the humeral physis is similar, the caudal metaphyseal region is mildly sclerotic, and there is a small metaphyseal lip at the caudal aspect of the physis. This is commonly seen in phases of rapid growth. D, Lateral view of the left shoulder of a 112-year-old Boxer. Although the caudal aspect of the proximal humeral physis is closed, there is incomplete physeal closure cranially. The proximal humeral physis is typically closed by 12 to 18 months. A B C D Chapter 4 n The Thoracic Limb 103 with a nondisplaced cortical fracture. In the cat, the nutri- ent canal is located at the same level but is in the medial cortex rather than being located caudally, and is usually not apparent radiographically. The feline humerus is straighter and more uniform in size throughout its length compared with the canine humerus (Figure 4-24). Con- versely, in chondrodystrophoid breeds, the humeral head is typically flatter and appears relatively larger, and the diaphysis appears relatively shorter and more curved. The bulbous nature of the humeral head and lipping of the caudal humeral head in chondrodystrophic dogs can be misinterpreted as osteophytosis (Figure 4-25). In the mature patient, a small triangular region of fat is often present just caudal to the humeral head. Occasionally, the axillobrachial vein, caudal circumflex humeral artery, and branch of the axillary nerve are visible within that fat when they are struck end-on by the x-ray beam (Figure 4-19). The opacity created by these struc- tures has been confused with a joint mouse. The humeral shaft (Figure 4-20) is relatively smooth, with the deltoid tuberosity readily apparent at the lateral aspect of the mid-diaphysis (Figures 4-21 and 4-22). A linear margin of increased opacity extending distally from the caudal aspect of the greater tubercle distally, the tri- cipital line, is confluent with the deltoid tuberosity. The small tuberosity for the teres major appears as a slight irregularity on the medial aspect of the diaphysis at the level of the mid-aspect of the deltoid tuberosity. The nutrient canal penetrates the caudal cortex at approxi- mately the junction of the middle and distal third of the diaphysis and is readily apparent on the lateral view (Figure 4-23). The nutrient canal should not be confused Figure 4-19. Lateral view of the caudal aspect of the shoulder joint in a 10-year-old Siberian Husky. The two circular opacities at the caudal aspect of the humeral head (solid white arrow) are the axillobrachial vein, the caudal circumflex humeral artery, and also a branch of the axillary nerve surrounded by fascial plane fat that provides adequate contrast to allow visibility. This opacity has been confused with a joint mouse. Figure 4-20. Lateral (A) and caudocranial (B) views of the humerus of a 112-year-old Boxer.

B C A Cranial aspect of lateral epicondyle Cranioproximal aspect of the radial head Lateral coronoid process Caudal edge of radius Cranial margin of medial coronoid process A1 THE ELBOW JOINT The elbow joint is unique in that three long bones must grow in perfect synchrony to ensure normal joint congru- ency. Disruption in growth of either the ulna or the radius results in joint incongruency, which can lead to limb deformity, fragmented medial coronoid process, frac- tured anconeal process, and severe degenerative joint disease. A standard radiographic examination of the elbow consists of a neutral lateral view with the brachium and antebrachium at an approximately 90-degree angle, a lateral view with the elbow highly flexed, and a cranio- caudal (or caudocranial) view (Figures 4-26 and 4-27). Distally, the humerus consists of one condyle divided into lateral and medial parts, each of which has an associ- ated epicondyle; the medial epicondyle is larger than the lateral epicondyle in both the dog and the cat. The lateral 108 Atlas of Normal Radiographic Anatomy and Anatomic Variants in the Dog and Cat Figure 4-27. A, Flexed lateral (A1 with labels) and (B) craniocaudal (B1 with labels) views of the elbow of an 8-year-old Golden Retriever. The flexed view reduces superimposition of the humeral epicondyles over the anconeal process. The anconeal process is an early site for the development of degenerative joint disease. In B1, the dotted black line reflects the medial margin of the proximal radius. Note the lateral position of the radius, a landmark for distin- guishing the lateral versus medial sides of the elbow joint in craniocaudal views. Note also the extent of the radius that does not articulate with the humerus in this view; this is often confused with elbow subluxation.

The radius is the best anatomic landmark to use to determine medial versus lateral in craniocaudal views of the elbow; the radius is medial at the carpus, as discussed in the later section on the carpus, and lateral at the elbow. The olecranon process of the ulna cannot be used to distinguish medial from lateral in craniocaudal radiographs of the elbow because it is positioned near the midline in this view. Also important is the fact that, in the craniocaudal view, there is a relatively large portion of the lateral aspect of the proximal articular surface of the radius that does not articulate with the humerus; this is often confused with elbow subluxation (see Figures 4-27 and 4-28). The medial aspect of the humeral condyle articulates with the trochlear notch of the ulna to form one of the most stable hinge joints in the body (Figure 4-29). The olecranon fossa is a deep cavity in the caudal part of the distal metaphysis of the humerus. The anconeal process of the ulna protrudes into this cavity when the elbow is in full extension (Figure 4-30). The olecranon fossa is contiguous with the radial fossa, a similar excava- tion on the cranial aspect of the distal metaphysis of the humerus, via the supratrochlear foramen. In the cat, the Figure 4-28. A dorsal plane CT image of a canine elbow, opti- mized for bone.

The hollow white arrowhead is the lateral aspect of the radial head, and the white arrow is the anconeal process of the ulna extending into the supratrochlear foramen of the humerus. Note how the lateral aspect of the radial head is lateral to the lateral aspect of the humeral condyle. M L Figure 4-29. Sagittal plane CT image of a canine elbow opti- mized for bone.

The solid white arrow is the anconeal process, the hollow white arrow is the trochlear notch, and the white arrow is the supratrochlear foramen. The apparent discon- nect between the humeral shaft and the condyle is because the image plane (0.6 mm) is through the center of the condyle and therefore at the level of the supratrochlear foramen. In exten- sion, the anconeal process extends into the olecranon fossa, the caudal aspect of the supratrochlear foramen. H U C R Figure 4-30.

This is normal in a patient of this age. The humeral condyle is typically fused by 12 weeks. humerus contains a supracondylar foramen located distomedially, through which the brachial artery and the median nerve pass (Figure 4-31). The feline humerus does not have a supratrochlear foramen. Many orthopedic diseases of the elbow in young patients are particularly challenging to diagnose radio- graphically. Quality radiographs with optimal contrast, detail, and positioning are important with respect to imaging this joint. In addition, as with all complex joints, specifically positioned views are often required to high- light particular aspects of the joint. A craniocaudal view with the cranial surface of the antebrachium rotated medially 15 degrees (Cr15°L-CdMO) allows for better assessment of the medial part of the condyle. This is important with respect to assessing possible osteochon- drosis of the medial part of the humeral condyle (see Figure 4-30). Also, superimposition of the ulna can con- found assessment of the intercondylar region when eval- uating for the presence of incomplete ossification of the humeral condyle. The lateral and medial parts of the humeral condyle normally fuse by 8 to 12 weeks,1 and no radiographic evidence of a division between the two should be visible after this time (Figure 4-32). Ideally, the medullary cavity of the ulna is positioned centrally over the intercondylar region to reduce unwanted superimpo- sition (Figure 4-33). This is often achieved by rotating the cranial surface of the antebrachium laterally 15 degrees and acquiring a Cr15°M-CdLO view. 2 The anconeal process of the ulna is best evaluated in a fully flexed lateral view. This helps avoid superimposi- tion with the large medial epicondyle of the humerus (Figure 4-34). There is some variation in contour of the anconeal process between breeds, which can make assess- ment of early remodeling associated with joint disease difficult to recognize (see Figures 4-26, 4-27, and 4-34). This is important because remodeling of the anconeal process is one of the earliest radiographically detectable changes associated with osteoarthritis. In a very small portion of medium and large breed dogs, the anconeal process arises as a separate center of ossification. This should not be confused with the disorder Ununited Anconeal Process (UAP) which manifests as a large wide radiolucent zone and large anconeal process fragment. The clinically important disorder UAP appears unrelated Chapter 4 n The Thoracic Limb 111 Figure 4-33. Cr15°M-CdLO view of a 9-year-old German Shorthaired Pointer. This view positions the medullary cavity of the ulna over the central aspect of the humeral condyle. This allows better assessment of the intercondylar region for ossifica- tion anomalies because, in a standard craniocaudal view, the ulnar cortex usually overlies the center of the humeral condyle.

Proximal margin of anconeal process Semilunar notch Caudal aspect of medial epicondyle Lateral epicondyle Cranioproximal aspect of radial head to the presence of an anconeal process ossification center.3 It is possible the disorder UAP reflects abnormal matura- tion or mechanical failure of the anconeal process due to mild joint incongruency. In the neutral lateral view, the medial coronoid process of the ulna is usually superimposed over the caudoproxi- mal aspect of the radius. This prevents critical evaluation of the medial coronoid process of the ulna in the lateral view, but the medial coronoid process does create a curved triangular opacity that can be seen in many patients (Figure 4-35). Proper radiographic technique is mandatory for visualization of this triangular opacity in the lateral view (Figures 4-36 and 4-37). Joint congru- ency, particularly humeroulnar incongruency, is better evaluated in the craniocaudal view where the medial coronoid process of the ulna appears as a sharply margin- ated shelf of bone subjacent to the medial aspect of the humeral condyle (see Figure 4-27). Chondrodystrophoid breeds commonly have a smaller medial coronoid process that is most apparent in the lateral view (Figure 4-38). The physes associated with the distal humeral condyle and medial epicondyle can complicate radiographic interpretation in the young patient (Figure 4-39). These physes are typically closed by 7 to 8 months of age. The triceps muscle group, the major extensor of the elbow joint, arises from the caudal aspects of the 112 Atlas of Normal Radiographic Anatomy and Anatomic Variants in the Dog and Cat Figure 4-35.

Optimal radiographic technique is needed to identify this struc- ture in this view. The lateral coronoid process is the solid white arrow. The radiolucent line outlined by the hollow white arrow is the caudal margin of the radial notch, between the medial and lateral coronoid processes, in which the caudoproximal aspect of the radius resides. This patient has a more coarse trabecular pattern in the proximal ulna when compared with patient (B), an 8-year-old Doberman Pinscher. Although this may be individual variation, a coarse trabecular pattern in this region is sometimes associated with degenerative joint disease. BA Chapter 4 n The Thoracic Limb 113 Figure 4-37.

Radiographically, this should be readily visible as a curved triangular opacity superimposed over the caudal aspect of the radial head. It should be congruent with the humeral condyle, and the humeroulnar joint space should be no smaller than the humeroulnar joint space radiographically. Figure 4-38.

B, Craniocaudal view of the elbow of a 312-month-old Boxer. The hollow white arrowheads delineate the distal humeral physis. It is common for both the medial and lateral aspects of the physis to be irregular with broad regions of lucency. The solid white arrow is the lateral aspect of the proximal radial physis. The cortical irregularity distal to this is normal, known as the cutback zone, which reflects a region of rapid osseous remodeling.

The hollow white arrowheads are the scar associated with the physis of the olecranon. The solid white arrows delineate two protuberances associated with the tuberosity of the olecranon. Developmentally, the tuberosity of the olecranon is the fused olecranon apophysis. scapula and the humeral shaft and attaches onto the olecranon process of the ulna. The olecranon process extends proximal to the trochlear notch and typically has two rounded unnamed prominences at its most proximal cranial margin. These should not be con fused with enthe- sophytes due to stress remodeling (Figure 4-40). Infrequently, a sesamoid bone is present in the supina- tor muscle at the craniolateral aspect of the proximal radius 4 in both dogs and cats. This should not be con- fused with an avulsion fragment or joint mouse (Figures 4-41 and 4-42). In cats, the sesamoid bone is rarely visible in the craniocaudal view and, when present, is most often visible in the lateral view (Figure 4-43, A, B). ANTEBRACHIUM The antebrachium extends from the elbow joint to the carpus and consists of the radius and ulna (Figure 4-44). As noted previously, although the radial head is lateral to the ulna at the elbow, the distal aspect of the radius is medial to the ulna at the carpus. At the elbow, the radial head interdigitates with the radial notch of the ulna and distally at the carpus, the styloid process of the ulna abuts the laterodistal aspect of the radius via the ulnar notch. Throughout the antebrachium, both the radius and the ulna are relatively smooth and regular. The radius has the larger diameter of the two and is the major weight bearer, whereas the ulna is highly attenuated distally. An impor- tant interosseous ligament is present at the proximal third of the radius at the level of the nutrient foramen. It is through this ligament that some of the forces borne by the radius at the antebrachiocarpal joint are transmitted to the ulna and then to the humerus. It is common to see an irregular cortical margination at the radial and ulnar attachment sites of the interosseous ligament. There is considerable variation in appearance of the interosseous ligament region, which complicates assessment of any disease that develops at this site (Figure 4-45). 116 Atlas of Normal Radiographic Anatomy and Anatomic Variants in the Dog and Cat Figure 4-41. A, Craniocaudal elbow radiograph of a 3-year-old Golden Retriever. The solid white arrow indicates a sesamoid bone at the craniolateral aspect of the radial head. This sesa- moid bone is in the supinator muscle and is reportedly radiographically apparent in approxi- mately 30% of patients and should not be confused with a fracture fragment or joint mouse. It is seen less frequently in the lateral view. Craniocaudal view (B) and lateral view (C) of the elbow of a 7-year-old Rottweiler. In this patient, the sesamoid bone is apparent in both the craniocaudal and lateral views (solid white arrows). A B C Chapter 4 n The Thoracic Limb 117 Figure 4-42. Transverse CT image of a canine elbow at the level of the radial head and medial coronoid process, optimized for bone. The osseous body at the craniolateral aspect of the humeral head is a sesamoid bone in the supinator muscle. This is an infrequent finding, occurring in about 30% of patients. It should not be confused with an osteochondral frag- ment that sometimes detaches from the medial coronoid process and migrates to the cranial aspect of the joint. L Figure 4-43. Lateral A, and caudocranial (B) views of the elbow of a 2-year-old Domestic Shorthair cat. The white arrow is the sesamoid associated with the supinator muscle. This is an infrequent finding in normal cats and should not be confused with a fracture fragment. The supinator sesamoid bone is lateral but is usually not evident in the craniocaudal view. The apparent widening of the medial aspect of the joint reflects normal joint laxity and is present in this view due to slight abduction of the joint during imaging. A B Lat 118 Atlas of Normal Radiographic Anatomy and Anatomic Variants in the Dog and Cat Figure 4-44. Lateral (A) and craniocaudal (B) views of the right antebrachium of a 7-year-old Labrador Retriever. The ante- brachial muscles transition to tendons at the level of the distal antebrachium, resulting in reduced soft tissue mass at the carpus. The proximal aspect of the radius is lateral at the elbow, and the distal aspect of the radius is medial at the carpus. The proximal aspect of the ulna is larger at the elbow, and, in a well-positioned craniocaudal view, it will be located essentially on the midline. Distally, the ulna is lateral at the carpus. BA Figure 4-45. A, Lateral view of the proximal aspect of the antebrachium of a 2-year-old German Shepherd. Enthesopathy at the caudal aspect of the proximal radius in the region of the interosseous ligament (hollow white arrow) is common. There is marked variation in the appearance of this region. In this patient, there is also endosteal sclerosis (solid white arrow). Lateral view of a 7-month-old Golden Retriever (B) and a similar view in a 9-month-old Labrador Retriever (C). In B, endosteal sclerosis, a common finding, is present (solid white arrow), and in C, what is presumed to be the nutrient foramen is readily visible (hollow white arrow). A B C The proximal radial physis typically closes at 7 to 10 months and the distal radial physis at 10 to 12 months. Approximately 70% of radial elongation occurs from growth at the distal physis, with the remaining 30% occurring from growth at the proximal physis5 (Figure 4-46). The distal ulnar physis typically closes at approxi- mately 9 to 12 months (Figure 4-47). All ulnar elonga- tion distal to the elbow results from growth at the distal ulnar physis. In other words, the rate of growth from the distal ulnar physis must equal the rate of growth from the proximal and distal radial physes combined. The distal ulnar physis is V-shaped, which might increase its predis- position to growth retardation following concussion. During phases of rapid growth, especially in large dogs, cortical and periosteal remodeling can result in a highly Chapter 4 n The Thoracic Limb 119 Figure 4-46. Lateral (A) and craniocaudal (B) views of the antebrachium of a 4-month-old Labrador Retriever. The physes associated with the distal humerus, proximal radius, distal radius, and ulna are readily apparent. The distal ulnar physis is typically V-shaped. The conical shape may predispose the physis to growth disruption following compression. A B irregular appearance of the margin of the metaphysis; this is particularly true for the distal metaphysis of the ulna. The distal ulnar metaphyseal region is also where the diameter of the ulna decreases rapidly compared with the large immediately adjacent physis, further contribut- ing to the marginal irregularity. This region of irregularity, called the cutback zone, is easy to misinterpret as an aggres- sive bone lesion, especially in the ulna (Figure 4-48). A derangement of physeal maturation in the distal ante- brachium can result in the development of major confor- mational abnormalities and degenerative joint disease. Chondrodystrophoid dogs typically have a more curving radius and a mild valgus deformity of the manus. This may be associated with inherent asynchronous growth of the radius versus the ulna (Figure 4-49). In the cat, long bones are typically straighter than in the dog, and the antebrachium is no exception. The feline ulna is larger distally compared with the canine ulna. Distally, it is lateral at the carpus and, as in the dog, does not contribute significantly to weight bearing (Figure 4-50). The carpal pad lies palmar to the carpus. This can create superimposed soft tissue edges over the carpus, which can be radiographically misinterpreted as a frac- ture (Figure 4-51). In addition, lateral to the carpal pad there is a marked reduction in soft tissue volume imme- diately proximal to the ante brachiocarpal joint. This can result in the false impression of a destructive process in the distal lateral aspect of the radius and distal medial aspect of the ulna (Figure 4-52). 120 Atlas of Normal Radiographic Anatomy and Anatomic Variants in the Dog and Cat Figure 4-47. Dorsopalmar (A) and lateral (B) views of a 3-month-old Labrador Retriever. Note the blunted appearance to the styloid process of the ulna. This is normal at this age. In addition, in B, the accessory carpal bone physis is readily visible. This typically closes by 4 to 5 months. C, Lateral view of the distal antebrachium of a 312-month-old German Shorthaired Pointer. The styloid process of the ulna is well developed compared with the patient in A and B, and the accessory carpal bone physis is fused. The caudal margin of the ulna is poorly defined. This is normal in young patients and is a manifestation of rapid growth and metaphyseal remodeling. D, Dorsolateral-palmaromedial oblique view of a 5-month-old Labrador Retriever. The obliquity enables unobstructed visualization of the distal ulnar physis. A B C D Chapter 4 n The Thoracic Limb 121 Figure 4-48. Lateral view of the distal antebrachium of a 5-month-old mixed breed dog. The metaphyseal cortex adjacent to the distal antebrachial physes is irregular (solid white arrows). This is the normal cutback zone and is associated with rapid growth and remodeling. Figure 4-49. Lateral (A) and craniocaudal (B) views of a 10-month-old Pembroke Welsh Corgi. The antebrachium is short and the radius more bowed in chondrodystrophoid breeds. There is considerable variation in the appearance of the antebrachium in chondrodystrophoid breeds, and what denotes normal conformation is somewhat subjective. Assessing the elbow joint for congruency is an important component of this process. This patient has good elbow congruency, and, clini- cally, the limb had no obvious valgus or rotational deformity.

In this patient, the distal radial and ulnar physes are open and readily visible. The feline distal ulnar physis is transverse like the radius, unlike the canine, which is V-shaped.

CARPUS The compound joint known as the carpus is between the distal radius and ulna, and the proximal aspect of the metacarpal bones. It comprises the cuboidal carpal bones arranged in two rows and an occasional sesamoid bone. Carpal flexion occurs almost exclusively at the ante- brachiocarpal joint. The carpus is a complex joint and, as with all such joints, a thorough radiographic assessment requires oblique projections in addition to the two stan- dard orthogonal projections. Refer to the section on oblique projections in Chapter 1. Chapter 4 n The Thoracic Limb 123 Dorsolateral-palmaromedial oblique view (C), with labels (C1).

The proximal row of carpal bones contains the radial, ulnar, and accessory carpal bones. The radial carpal bone, the largest cuboidal carpal bone, is primarily medial, and its proximal margin articulates with the distal aspect of the radius. The lateral margin articulates with the ulnar carpal bone, and the distal margin articulates with all four cuboidal carpal bones in the distal row. Medially, there is a portion of the radial carpal bone that is not articular; this is often confused with subluxation of the radial carpal bone (see Figures 4-51 and 4-53).

Craniocaudal (A) and lateral (B) views of the left distal antebrachium of a 7-year-old English Setter. There is a region of decreased opacity in the distal lateral aspect of the antebrachium in A, the medial margin of which is delineated by the solid white arrows. This is an artifact associated with the normal soft tissue void lateral and proximal to the carpal pad, the caudal margin of which is delineated in B by the solid white arrows. This should not be confused with an aggressive radial lesion. C, Craniocaudal view of the distal antebra- chium of a 4-year-old Belgian Tervuren. The lucency over the distal lateral aspect of the radius is readily apparent. A craniolateral-caudomedial oblique view (D) is the optimal view to rule out this artifact.

Note the close association of the distal radius and ulna, immediately proximal to the antebrachiocarpal joint. Radiographically, the large soft tissue void palmar to the ulna (white asterisk) can create the false impression of a destruc- tive process at the distal aspect of the radius and ulna. In C, RC is the radial carpal bone, UC is the ulnar carpal bone and AC is the accessory carpal bone. In D, each carpal bone is identi- fied C1-C5. The most lateral bone, UC, is the distal aspect of the ulnar carpal bone. It articu- lates proximally with the radius, the ulna, the lateral aspect of the radial carpal bone, the accessory carpal bone, the fourth carpal bone, and the fifth metacarpal bone; hence, it is visible at the level of the distal row of carpal bones.

The majority of the carpal range of motion occurs at the antebrachiocarpal joint. The flexed lateral view is particularly useful in the assessment of the proximal margin of the radial carpal bone. Distal radius Groove for extensor carpi radialis Antebrachiocarpal joint Dorsal aspect of radial carpal bone Intercarpal joint Carpometacarpal joint Superimposed metacarpal bones 2-5 Distal ulna Accessory carpal bone First metacarpal bone bone articulates proximally with the radius, the ulna, the lateral aspect of the radial carpal bone, the accessory carpal bone, the fourth carpal bone, and the fifth meta- carpal bone. Some dogs have a small sesamoid bone located at the distal medial aspect of the radial carpal bone. This sesamoid bone is located in the tendon of the abductor pollicis longus muscle and should not be confused with a chip fracture or joint mouse (see Figure 4-51). The distal row of carpal bones contains the first, second, third, and fourth carpal bones, which articulate with the radial and ulnar carpal bones proxi- mally and their respective metacarpal bones distally (see Figure 4-51). The articulation between the antebrachium and proximal row of carpal bones is the antebrachiocar- pal joint. The articulation between the proximal and distal rows of carpal bones is the intercarpal joint. The articulation between the distal carpal and metacarpal bones is the carpometacarpal joint. Almost all of the range of motion in flexion occurs at the antebrachiocar- pal joint (Figure 4-54). The feline distal antebrachium and carpus is similar to the canine with the exception of the ulna. Distally at the carpus, the feline ulna is more bulbous and rounded (Figure 4-55). Stress radiography is often needed to definitively diag- nose the nature of soft tissue injuries a joint may have sustained; this is particularly important in the carpus. When a soft tissue injury is suspected, pressure should be applied to the antebrachium and manus in a way to apply tension to the appropriate soft tissue structures (Figure 4-56). Appropriate recognition of carpal instability can markedly alter patient outcome. Chapter 4 n The Thoracic Limb 127 Figure 4-55. Dorsopalmar view of the carpus and manus of a 20-year-old Domestic Shorthair cat (A) and an 11-year-old Domestic Shorthair cat (B). The distal aspect of the ulna is larger than in the canine. A small radiolucent region is present in the distal aspect of the ulna. This is commonly present in the cat and does not reflect an aggressive lesion. A B 128 Atlas of Normal Radiographic Anatomy and Anatomic Variants in the Dog and Cat Figure 4-56. To examine the carpus radiographically while under stress, pressure should be applied such that the soft tissues under investigation are placed under tension. In the case of damage to the flexor retinaculum, either pressure can be applied in the direction of the arrows (A) or the limb can be positioned and loaded to mimic weight bearing. B, Stressed lateral view of the right forelimb of a 7-year-old English Setter. This patient sustained injury to the carpus. There is carpal hyperextension centered at the level of the intercarpal joint as a result of disruption to palmar soft tissues. Soft tissue swelling is evident palmar to the metacarpal bones.

Note in A how the medial aspect of the radial carpal bone does not articu- late with the radius; this is often misinterpreted as a subluxation. The dotted white line in A-D is the metacarpal pad.

There is variability in the presence of the first meta- carpal bone and associated phalanges, the dewclaw, secondary to either hypoplasia or removal at birth. The second through fifth metacarpophalangeal joints are each characterized by two sesamoid bones at the palmar aspect of each joint and one sesamoid bone at the dorsal aspect of each joint (Figures 4-57 and 4-58). The palmar sesa- moid bones are numbered from medial to lateral, with the most medial sesamoid bone of the second metacar- pophalangeal joint being sesamoid bone #1 and the most lateral sesamoid of the fifth metacarpophalangeal joint being sesamoid bone #8 (Figure 4-58). Occasionally, the 130 Atlas of Normal Radiographic Anatomy and Anatomic Variants in the Dog and Cat Figure 4-58. A is dorsopalmar view of the manus at the level of the metacarpophalangeal joints. Images B, C, and D are thin slice transverse CT images at levels 1, 2, and 3, respectively; dorsal is at the top of each image. In B, the second through fifth digits are identified as palmar sesamoid bones 1, 2, 7, and 8. The palmar sesamoid bones articulating with the distal meta- carpal bones are readily visible in both B and C. In D, the small sesamoid bones at the dorsoproximal aspect of the proximal phalanx are readily visible (solid white arrows). In D, the metacarpal pad (MP) is evident. 1 A 2 3 1 B 2 2 3 4 5 7 8 C D MP Chapter 4 n The Thoracic Limb 131 Figure 4-59. Dorsopalmar view of a 9-year-old Dalmatian. There is fragmentation and remodeling of the #2 palmar sesamoid bone (solid white arrow) and of the #7 palmar sesa- moid bone (hollow white arrow). These changes are often associated with incomplete sesamoid bone ossification, are often exacerbated by trauma, and may or may not cause lameness. Medial palmar sesamoid bones, particularly second and seventh, will be multipartite (Figure 4-59). This can result in lame- ness in some patients. 6 The large metacarpal pad is palmar to the metacarpo- phalangeal joints. The shape of this pad is such that superimposition can result in linear oblique radiolucen- cies over the digits, which can be mistaken for fractures (see Figure 4-57). Each metacarpal bone consists of a base proximally and a head distally; the head articulates with the base of the associated proximal phalanx (see Figure 4-57). The proximal and middle phalanges consist of a base, body, and trochlea. The distal phalanges consist of a base proximally and an ungual process and associated unguis, or nail, distally (Figure 4-60). Postnatally, there is a visible physis on the distal aspect of the second through fifth metacarpal (and metatarsal) bones that closes at approximately 6 to 7 months of age. There is no visible physis of the proximal aspect of the second through fifth metacarpal (or metatarsal) bones. In the proximal and middle phalanges of digits two through five, the visible physes are located proximally and these close earlier (Figures 4-61 and 4-62). There are no visible physes on the distal aspect of the proximal or middle phalanges of digits two through five. There is never a radiographically visible physis on the distal phalanx in the dog or cat. Superimposition of the phalanges can sometimes be alleviated by applying traction to the digit of interest (Figure 4-63). The distal phalanx will be absent in cats that have been declawed at this level (Figure 4-64). Polydactyly is uncommon in both the dog and the cat but can be more common in the cat. It usually manifests as additional vestigial digits medially. These patients are typically asymptomatic (Figure 4-65). 132 Atlas of Normal Radiographic Anatomy and Anatomic Variants in the Dog and Cat Figure 4-60. Dorsopalmar (A) and lateral (B) views of the digits of a 4-year-old Belgian Tervuren. In A, it is not possible to differentiate medial from lateral. Although the second and fifth digits are shorter than the third and fourth, and, typically, the fifth digit is margin- ally shorter than the second, this is unreliable; using radiographic markers or including the distal aspect of the carpus is necessary. There are paired sesamoid bones at the palmar aspect of each metacarpophalangeal joint and one sesamoid bone dorsally. C, Dorsopalmar view of the digits of a 4-year-old Cardigan Welsh Corgi.
