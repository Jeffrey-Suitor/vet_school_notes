L E C T U R E O V E R V I E W The exocrine pancreas plays a pivotal role in the digestion of food via the secretion of digestive enzymes/pro- enzymes and bicarbonate. Several defence mechanisms exist to prevent auto-digestion of this organ and of other host tissues. However, in certain circumstances, these defences can go awry, be circumvented or become exhausted, resulting in pancreatic necrosis (necrotising pancreatitis). Although injury to the exocrine pancreas may provoke clinical signs during the acute phase, the large functional reserve of this organ allows many disease processes to smoulder subclinically for prolonged periods. When clinical signs do emerge, they may largely reflect maldigestion (for example, weight loss despite a normal to increased or depraved appetite, gross abnormalities in the volume, colour and/or odour of the faeces or in the frequency of defaecation), jaundice (due to obstruction of the distal biliary tree) or metabolic disturbances arising from concurrent destruction of the endocrine components of the pancreas (diabetes mellitus). We will review the important disorders of the exocrine pancreas in domestic animals, including developmental anomalies, diffuse and focal atrophy, pancreatic necrosis, pancreatitis, pancreatic duct obstruction, nodular hyperplasia and neoplasia. The known causes and characteristic diagnostic features of the various exocrine pancreatic disorders will also be discussed. F U R T H E R R E A D I N G Pancreas.
