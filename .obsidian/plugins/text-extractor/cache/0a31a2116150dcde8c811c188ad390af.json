V iew FAO FishFinder Species fact sheet Profile Historical backgr ound Atlantic salmon culture began in the 19 th century in the UK in freshwater as a means of stocking waters with parr in order to enhance wild returns for anglers. Sea cage culture was first used in the 1960s in Norway to raise Atlantic salmon to marketable size. The early successes in Norway prompted the development of salmon culture in Scotland, and latterly Ireland, the Faroe Islands, Canada, the North Eastern seaboard of the USA, Chile and Australia (T asmania). Minor production also occurs in New Zealand, France and Spain. All of the major 8/27/2021 FAO Fisheries & Aquaculture - Cultured Aquatic Species Information Programme - Salmo salar (Linnaeus, 1758) www.fao.or g/ﬁshery/culturedspecies/Salmo_salar/en 2 /9 production areas lie within latitudes 40-70º in the Northern Hemisphere, and 40-50º in the Southern Hemisphere. The early Norwegian success reflected the excellent deep sheltered sites available, favourable hydrographic conditions (stable temperatures and salinities), natural salmon strains that mature late, and heavy governmental support and investment. Scottish strains of salmon tend to mature early , reducing the value of fish as they reach marketable size, so Norwegian strains were introduced to reduce this problem. Generations of cross breeding have resulted in hybrid strains which are now the norm in most production areas. Irish production has been limited by shallow sheltered water and local opposition. The economic value of salmon farming in the Faroes has now overtaken that of fishing. North American salmon culture mainly features Atlantic salmon on both coasts. Chile has become a major producer since Atlantic salmon were introduced from Norway and Scotland in the early 1980s. Chile benefits from low production costs and easy access to fish meal for salmon feed production, which allows it to compete with Northern hemisphere producers for lucrative markets. Salmon farming reached T asmania in 1984, with the importation of eggs from Nova Scotia, Canada. The area has favourable sea temperatures and its relative isolation from other wild and cultured Atlantic salmon avoids some of the major infectious disease problems. Lack of suitable sites will most likely limit the expansion of the industry there. Rapid increases in production have led to falling prices, which in turn have put increasing pressures on producers to limit costs. Significant future expansion of the industry may rely on the development of of fshore sites, since most of the available suitable inshore sites are already in use, and because of increasing antagonism towards, and regulation over , further expansion in sheltered areas. The vast majority of Atlantic salmon currently in production is hybrid stock, derived originally from native crossed with Norwegian stock. Some family breeding programmes are now in place, in order to attempt to identify family lines with increased production potential and/or disease resistance. The use of sex or genetic manipulation in Atlantic salmon is not widely used in cultured fish. Main pr oducer countries Main pr oducer countries of Salmo salar (F AO Fishery Statistics, 2006) Habitat and biology W ild Atlantic salmon are found in the North Atlantic on both European (Portugal to Russia) and North American (Cape Cod to Labrador) sides. They also occur around North Atlantic islands (e.g. UK, Iceland, Greenland). They spend up to 4 years in deep-sea feeding grounds feeding on pelagic species such as herring , sprat and squid . At the onset of maturation, fish cease feeding, and return to their rivers of origin to spawn (October - January). Most fish die following spawning, although some may return to sea as \"kelts\". 8/27/2021 FAO Fisheries & Aquaculture - Cultured Aquatic Species Information Programme - Salmo salar (Linnaeus, 1758) www.fao.or g/ﬁshery/culturedspecies/Salmo_salar/en 3 /9 Eggs are released and fertilized in \"redds\" in upstream gravel beds, where they eye after approximately 250 degree days and hatch after a further 250, in spring. The hatched alevins live of f their yolk sacs for approximately 300 degree days, hiding amongst the gravel and rocks in the streams, until they begin to feed as fry. Juvenile fish remain in freshwater , feeding on insect larvae and small fish, through fry and parr stages for 2-5 years, until they under go seawater adaptation and become \"smolts\" (smoltification, a process triggered by changing photoperiod) and migrate downriver to sea (normally March-June), where they head for deep water feeding grounds to grow and mature. W ild smolts are normally around 20-30 g; fish in seawater can reach lar ge sizes but are typically 8-13 kg when they start their spawning migration. Production Pr oduction cycle Production cycle of Salmo salar Pr oduction systems Seed supply Fr eshwater hatchery Broodstock are selected from seasite production stocks, and normally moved into freshwater tanks or cages in autumn approximately 2 months prior to stripping. Eggs are stripped dry , fertilized with milt, then water hardened and disinfected, prior to laying them down in trays or silo systems. They are \"shocked\" following eyeing by pouring from one container into another to remove unfertilized eggs. Hatching takes place in hatchery trays or following transfer to tanks. Alevins are provided with a matting or 8/27/2021 FAO Fisheries & Aquaculture - Cultured Aquatic Species Information Programme - Salmo salar (Linnaeus, 1758) www.fao.or g/ﬁshery/culturedspecies/Salmo_salar/en 4 /9stony \"substrate\" to mimic the natural gravel \"redd\", and usually maintained in darkened conditions. Incubation of eggs and alevins normally takes place in water at <10 °C. Following yolk sac absorption, alevins will \"swim up\" in the water column, indicating readiness to first feed. First feeding, using inert feeds, is normally carried out following transfer of late alevins into tanks, although feed may initially be of fered in hatchery trays. \"Feeding fry\" can be grown on in tanks, either using flow-through or various recirculation systems, or subsequently in lake cage systems, through parr stages to smolt. Nursery Fish can either be maintained on ambient temperature and light regimes to produce \"S1\" smolts in the spring of the year following hatch, or light and temperature regimes can be manipulated artificially to induce early smoltification. Production densities vary depending on the system; very intensive systems may maintain fish at densities as high as 50 kg/m³ or higher . Ongrowing techniques In seawater Smolted fish at 40-120 g are transferred to seasites following the determination that fish have smolted and are adapted for seawater survival, using combinations of experience and seawater tolerance testing techniques. T ransfers are usually carried out in specialized transport tanks by any combination of road, helicopters, and by sea in specialized \"wellboats\" (boats with lar ge wells circulating seawater). Ongrowing at sea normally takes place in cages consisting of lar ge nets suspended from various floating \"walkway\" systems anchored to the seabed, although some production has been carried out in pump-ashore seawater tank systems. Cages may be square or circular in design, and come in various sizes and systems. The lar ger sites may have cages as large as 24 m² or 100 m in diameter , suspending nets that may reach depths of 15-18 m, enclosing water volumes of thousands of cubic metres. Several cages may be grouped together to form a seasite. Seasites are selected on their suitability with regard to water temperature, salinity , flow and exchange rates, proximity to other farms and/or wild fisheries, and in compliance with local licensing regulations. Atlantic salmon grow best in sites where water temperature extremes are in the range 6-16 °C, and salinities are close to oceanic levels (33-34‰). W ater flows need to be suf ficient to eliminate waste and to supply well oxygenated water (approximately 8 ppm). Maximum stocking densities of up to 20 kg/m³ are usual. Atlantic salmon are ongrown in seasites for up to 2 years with harvesting of fish from 2 kg upwards. Seasites normally contain a single generation of fish. Good practice is to fallow seasites for a period of 6 weeks or more prior to the introduction of a new generation of fish. Feed supply The bulk of salmon feeds are produced by three or four lar ge companies. Fish meal and fish oil, derived lar gely from the huge industrial fisheries in South America, still form the basis of salmon diets, although increasing pressure on these sources have led to increased research into the substitution of fish products with vegetable protein and oil sources in recent times. Salmon grower diets contain high levels of fish oil, which is ef ficiently converted by the salmon, often at food conversion ratios of close to 1:1. Feeding methods and technology have also advanced in recent years. Many seafarms use computerized systems to drive automated feeding systems, with feedback mechanisms to detect when fish have finished feeding. This allows fish to be fed to satiation without overfeeding and consequent feed wastage. In order to produce fish with the flesh colour demanded by the market, carotenoid pigments are added to the diet (at high cost to the farmer) during the seawater growing phase of the production cycle. Harvesting techniques Methods of harvesting vary but fish are generally starved for up to 3 days beforehand. The whole process is carried out with the aim to keep stress to a minimum, thus maximising flesh quality . The fish are crowded in pens using sweep nets and are either pumped from the holding pen alive and transported to the slaughter plant, generally by well boat, or slaughtered on the side of the pens. Handling and processing In Scotland, for example, most fish are initially stunned using an automated stunner or a blow to the head. Bleeding is then carried out by cutting the gill arches rapidly and the fish are immersed in iced water . W aste disposal of blood is strictly controlled in order to prevent disease transmission. The fish are then gutted, washed 8/27/2021 FAO Fisheries & Aquaculture - Cultured Aquatic Species Information Programme - Salmo salar (Linnaeus, 1758) www.fao.or g/ﬁshery/culturedspecies/Salmo_salar/en 5 /9 and chilled. Once the flesh temperature reaches approximately 3 °C, the fish are graded and packed on ice. At this stage, whole fish can be frozen for sale as whole frozen salmon or as fresh gutted salmon. However , most fish are filleted and either sold as fresh salmon fillets or set aside for smoking. The smoking of salmon accounts for over 60 percent of total salmon use. Many dif ferent methods of smoking exist, but to summarize the process, the fillets are salted, and smoked over smouldering wood chips. The product is then trimmed, de-boned and either sliced by hand or machines. Production costs Costs of production vary considerably depending on: Farm unit size. Prevailing health status of stocks. Geographic/political location. A vailability and cost of raw materials (feed, eggs/fish etc). Method of calculation. The largest single cost for an ongrower is normally feed. A typical cost of production in Scotland would be around £ 0.60 (USD 1.00) per smolt for a smolt producer , and around £ 1.50 per kg (USD 2.50/kg) for an ongrower .

Status and trends The following status and trends exist: Current worldwide production of farmed Atlantic salmon exceeds 1 000 000 tonnes. Farmed Atlantic salmon constitute >90 percent of the farmed salmon market, and >50 percent of the total global salmon market. The major markets for farmed Atlantic salmon are Japan, the European Union, and North America. The major products remain fresh (whole, steaked, filleted), frozen, and smoked (mainly for the European market). A small but increasing percentage is on-processed to supply value-added products into the market. Because of rapid increases in production over the last 10-15 years, ex-farm prices have fallen sharply . This, and the decreasing availability of suitable sites have limited further growth in production in the Northern hemisphere. The most rapidly growing supplier now is Chile, which has low labour and materials costs and can therefore ef fectively compete with traditional producing countries in distant markets. Many producers in Europe are unable to sell fish into the market at the cost of production. There has been an increase in the development of quality schemes, both industry and interest-group led (e.g. or ganic/welfare-related schemes), in order to try and protect market prices. Political intervention (e.g. minimum import prices for Atlantic salmon imported into the EU from non-EU countries) has failed to maintain market prices in some markets. Much of the state-of-the-art research into salmonid farming still takes place in traditional Northern European producing countries, and much of this focuses on developing economies of scale in order to reduce unit production costs and protect profit mar gins. However , it seems likely that significant future production increases will take place in Chile, where costs of production are generally lower due to lower cost of labour and raw materials. For up-to-date salmon market prices, see Globefish or local market or ganisations. Main issues Atlantic salmon farming has long been controversial and its ef fect on the environment and on wild fisheries (particularly salmonid fisheries) is questioned by many individuals and or ganizations. The major areas of concern are detailed in W orld W ildlife Fund reports: Local nutrient pollution into water systems, by waste feed/faeces. 8/27/2021 FAO Fisheries & Aquaculture - Cultured Aquatic Species Information Programme - Salmo salar (Linnaeus, 1758) www.fao.or g/ﬁshery/culturedspecies/Salmo_salar/en 8 /9 Local chemical pollution, by use of chemical treatments. Effect on wild fish, by escapees, through disease spread. Global environmental impact and issues of sustainability , since salmon production relies on supplies of fishmeal and fish oil for feed production, from industrial fisheries. Concerns have also been expressed relating to welfare of the farmed fish. See Compassion in W orld Farming and Farm Animal W elfare Council reports for examples. Responsible aquacultur e practices Various quality schemes now exist which are variously designed to improve the quality , safety, welfare, and environmental sustainability of farmed Atlantic salmon. These include: Industry-led schemes, e.g. Scottish Quality Salmon . Retailer-led schemes, e.g. UK supermarket quality schemes; the Label Rouge government-led scheme in France ( www .agriculture.gouv .fr ). Niche market schemes (e.g. Organic salmon schemes, welfare schemes such as Freedom Foods ). Most producing countries are governed by regulations that aim to protect the environment, the fish, and the consumer . For specific details contact the relevant Government authority .
