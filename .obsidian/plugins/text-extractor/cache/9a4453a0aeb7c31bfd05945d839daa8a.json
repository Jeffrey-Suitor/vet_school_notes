Chemical Synapse Sherwood p93 Signal transfer in synapsesThe chemical Synapse • Neuron – neuron communication • Presynaptic neuron stimulates the postsynaptic neuron • There is a time lag (synaptic delay) of 0.5 to 1.0 msec Neurotransmitters • Acetylcholine • Dopamine • Norepinephrine • (noradrenaline) • Epinephrine (adrenaline) • Serotonin • Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) • Vasoactive intestinal peptide VIP • Cholecystokinin, Enkephalin • Somatostatin, Enkephalin, Neurotensin • Enkephalin • Substance P • Thyrotropin-releasing hormone Classical neurotransmitters Neuropeptides Acetylcholine synapse Source Rhoades p236 receptors The neurotransmitter acetylcholine • A cholinergic synapse • Receptors in the postsynaptic neuron – Nicotinic increases Na+ permeability, drives membrane closer to threshold – Muscarinic • M1 decreases K+ permeability, drives membrane closer to threshold (e.g. exocrine glands) • M2 increases K+ permeability, drives membrane further from threshold (e.g. Heart) Postsynaptic potentials Presynaptic axon Postsynaptic axon Axon hillock has low threshold where action potentials are generated Graded potentials Graded potentials The initiation of action potentials by graded potentials Temporal summation of graded potentialsSpatial summation of graded potentials Source Rhoades p 247 Spatial Summation of two post-synaptic potentials to reach threshold Source Rhoades p 247 Excitatory and inhibitory synapses Excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSP) Source Rhoades p235 Inhibitory postsynaptic potentials IPSPs Source rhoades p235 Postsynaptic integration Neuronal connection and pathway is complex Some neurons in CNS receive 100,000 synaptic inputs Case study https://wagwalking.com/ Tetanus toxin (tetanospasmin) • Binds to presynaptic membrane and blocks the release of inhibitory neurotransmitters (GABA and glycine). • The excitatory signals in the postsynaptic neurons are unchecked • Uncontrolled muscle contractions and spasm • Lockjaw Lecture Summary Synapses between presynaptic and post synaptic neurons • AP Ca++ neurotransmitter release • Graded potentials in postsynaptic neurons • Post synaptic potentials EPSP(+ve), IPSP (-ve) • Post synaptic integration • Axon hillock threshold AP in post synaptic neuron Contact: Babatunde Ayodele awodeleb@unimelb.edu.au","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
