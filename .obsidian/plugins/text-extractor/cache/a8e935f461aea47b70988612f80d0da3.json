Would be similar on a dry matter basis. • Evaluation of this diet: • 7.98 MJ is enough energy to maintain 43-44kg. • also treats, dog biscuits and scraps are not included here. • Excess of protein and fat, not much fibre.

Feed calculation results CANNED DIETS: • Chum: 3 cans required for ME. low protein, v high fat. 42g fibre • Optimum: 2.5 cans required for ME. Protein OK, vv high fat. 17.5g fibre • Advance (a weight control diet): 3.5 cans required for ME (if fed alone). High in protein, fairly high in fat as well. 73.5g fibre – would fill the dog up and prevent hunger, but labour intensive feeding 3.5 cans! (and expensive - $18/day). • Crave: would need to feed 4 cans per day ($18), and would give very high protein and fat, and very little fibre (8g). • My Dog: 2 cans per day (the most energy dense of the canned feeds). Adequate protein and fat but only 6.8g fibre. The dog may still be hungry. • Pedigree: 2.5 cans per day. High in protein and fat, very little fibre (5.25g). Cheap, but dog may still be hungry. • Woolworths own brand: 1.5 cans, but the cans are large (1.2kg). OK protein and fat, fibre 27g. Cheapest option but not suitable. • Nature’s gift: would need 4.5 small cans. V high protein and fat. 13.7g fibre. Feed calculation results DRY DIETS: • Supercoat (designed as a healthy weight diet): 5.5 cups. High in protein, OK in fat. 35.75g fibre. • Optimum: 5 cups. Excess protein and fat. 40g fibre. • Advance Healthy weight: (designed as healthy weight diet). 5 cups. High protein, fat not too bad. High fibre though (60g). One of the higher energy densities at 345 kcal/100g, although most are fairly similar. • Baxters: 5.5 cups. Excess protein and fat. 16.5g fibre. Cheapest (reportedly this diet is not very palatable). • Crave: 4.5 cups. Most energy dense of the dry foods (392 kcals/100g). Very excessive protein and fat (and expensive). 15.75g fibre. • Pedigree adult dry food. 5 cups. Higher protein and fat than required. 10g fibre. • Nature’s goodness grain free: 5 cups. V high in protein and fat. Low in fibre (15g). • Nature’s gift: 5 cups. High in protein and fat. Low in fibre (12.5g). • • Overall: most of the dry foods have similar energy density (around 335 kcal/100g). • Cost: all dry diets much cheaper than wet foods, so small differences not so important. Chosen diet • 1.5 cans wet food plus 2.5 cups dry food • Provides 6.7 MJ ME per day, appropriate for ideal weight • High in fibre (12% compared to previous diet 5%) • Should be sufficient volume to make the dog feel full, and reduce begging. • Should have lower glycaemic index • (starch levels not quoted but will be lower) • Fairly high protein (26% DM) How to work out carbohydrate content • All dog foods contain the macronutrients: • proteins, • fats, • Carbohydrates (mostly fibre and starch) • Water • Also contain ASH • (the residue when proteins, fats and carbs are burnt away) • Approx 8% of dry matter • Carbohydrates are not usually listed (no requirement) CHO = 100 – %protein - %fat - %ash • If fibre value is given, Starch/sugars = 100 – %protein - %fat - %ash - %fibre Monitoring • Aiming for 1-3% weight loss per week • Don’t want excessive weight loss – will get muscle loss • Significant weight loss can take 12-15 weeks (warn owner) • Body condition score may not change to begin with • Internal fat as well as external! • Could use a 9-point BCS system rather than 5-point • Could also record changes in girth measurements with a tape measure.","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
