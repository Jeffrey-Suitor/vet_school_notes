She then returned to Australia to do a PhD in equine systemic inflammation at the University of Melbourne and was an equine medicine clinician in the U-Vet Equine Centre until mid-2021. She is now a Senior Lecturer in Veterinary Biosciences (a position that allows the full unleashing of her inner physiology nerd!) and continues to undertake research in equine sepsis. Email: jennifer.bauquier@unimelb.edu.au INTENDED LEARNING OUTCOMES At the end of this lecture, you should be able to: • define the main functions of the kidneys • describe the functional anatomy of the nephron • broadly explain how glomerular filtration occurs, why it is important and the factors that regulate it • broadly explain tubular processes involved in producing and modifying urine. KEYWORDS kidneys, nephron, glomerulus, afferent and efferent arterioles, glomerular filtration, macula densa, juxtaglomerular apparatus, tubules LECTURE 18 – STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF THE KIDNEYS 1 – MAIN FUNCTIONS AND FUNCTIONAL ANATOMY This lecture will provide an introduction to the structure and functions of the kidneys, providing a basic understanding of the nephron, glomerular filtration, tubular reabsorption and secretion, and physiological control of these functions which we will build on in the following lecture.
