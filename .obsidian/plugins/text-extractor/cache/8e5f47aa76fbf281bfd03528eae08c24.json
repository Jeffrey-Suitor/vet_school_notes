Make a profit Make a profit from sale of milk Make a profit from sale of milk and stock Make a profit by efficiently producing and selling milk and stock Maximise profit by efficiently producing and selling milk and stock • Nutrition • Fertility • Health • Milk Quality Fertility and Genetics Fertility – reproductive efficiency In breeding enterprises, when an animal becomes pregnant is very important Giving birth is necessary for: • Producing offspring where they are sold • Starting a lactation for milking animals Genetics – having high quality animals • Cattle can have different genes suitable for particular purposes KPIs – Seasonal/Split calving herds Primary KPIs • 6-week in-calf (“pregnancy”) rate • Not-in-calf rate (“empty”) rate Factors affecting 6-week in-calf rate • 3-week Submission rate • A.I. Conception rate Factors affecting not-in-calf rate • 6-week in-calf rate • Bulls Reproduction is important! Cows calve at the “right time” for the farm They produce more milk and get in calf quicker More AI replacement calves 1% change in 6 week in-calf rate: • $3.02 (ADHIS/Dairy CRC economic model behind the Australian Profit Ranking index calculation) • $4.00 (Australian InCalf economic model) • $3.34 (NZ Dexel whole farm model) 6 KPIs – year round herds Overall performance • 100 day in calf rate • 200 day in calf rate Drivers of in-calf rates • 80-day submission rate • Conception rate 7 How do we achieve this? • Growing heifers well • Maintaining body condition and providing adequate nutrition • Sound heat detection practices • Good AI technique • “Bull power” and bull management • Minimising cow health problems at calving and in early lactation (i.e. transition cow management!) • Genetics (fertility) Genetics: Breeding better cows The benefits of AI… Production Averages by % of Artificially Bred Cows in Herds Percentage of Number Production Averages Artificially Bred of Milk Fat Protein Cows in Herd Herds litres kg kg < 10 539 5,921 238 197 10-19 137 6,268 247 208 20-29 143 6,546 256 215 30-39 167 6,721 264 223 40-49 217 6,533 262 217 50-59 262 6,871 276 227 60-69 320 7,080 278 233 70-79 368 7,404 291 243 80-89 352 7,245 284 241 > 89 518 7,242 287 240 Total, AVG 3,023 6,890 273 228 > 89 % of AVG 105.1 105.1 105.3 < 10 % of AVG 85.9 87.2 86.4 Australian Dairy Herd Improvement Scheme (ADHIS) Australian database of herd test results and conformational data Australian Breeding Values (ABVs) • Calculated bi-annually (Feb/August) • Numerous traits: – Milk (L) – Protein (kg) – Fat (kg) – Cell count – Fertility – et al… Source: Datagene Combining Breeding ValuesGenomics • Sequencing of bulls and cows <1 year old • Collection of tail hair samples (from birth!) • Genomic sequencing to determine ABV(g)s • ↑ reliability for young animals esp. for traits such as fertility/longevity – Equivalent of 25-30 milking daughters (Bulls) – Or, 7 lactations (Cows) • More rapid genetic gain! Choosing a Bull 14 Recommendations from ADHIS • Use the highest BPI bulls you can afford ($15-45/straw) • Use progeny test semen on some of the herd (↓ $$$) • Keep good records to reduce inbreeding • Breed enough replacements to enable older cows to be culled Also… Select a range of sires rather than only one or two Crossbreeding – another option AEPS – DAIRY WEEK 1 17","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
