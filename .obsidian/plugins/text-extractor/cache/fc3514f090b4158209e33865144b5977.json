These elements determine where different classes of stock may be managed and how many of them can be grazed in an area – the stocking density. Rainfall • Relatively low rainfall over much of Australia https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/fao- aquastat.appspot.com/o/PDF%2FMAPS%2FPrecipitation_eng.p df?alt=media&token=a59b3bca-3685-42c0-aa44- 6eb2e1a44810 A closer look at Australian rainfall • Generally higher rainfall closer to coast • Also Great Dividing Range • Northern areas • But average can be misleading • Variations in pattern • Inconsistent (drought/flood) http://www.bom.gov.au/jsp/ncc/climate_averages/rainfall/index.jsp High versus low rainfall years http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/maps/rainfall/?variable =rainfall&map=totals&period=12month&region=nat& year=2021&month=01&day=31 http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/maps/rainfall/?variable =rainfall&map=totals&period=12month&region=nat& year=1983&month=02&day=28 Irrigation MURRAY DARLING BASIN (AND OTHER AREAS) RIVERS, CHANNELS MOVING WATER FROM LAKE BASED STORAGE CAN SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE PASTURE/CROP PRODUCTION IN A REGION (E.G.
