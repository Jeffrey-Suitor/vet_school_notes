Greyhound skeleton Image by Dr Helen Davies Comparative skeletons Images by Dr Helen Davies Axial vs appendicular skeleton Image by Dr Helen Davies Axial skeleton Image by Dr Helen Davies • Skull • Mandible • Hyoid • Vertebral column • Ribcage Skull and mandible Skull • Formed by an interlocking of many bones • Fibrous joints between = “sutures” • Sutures flexible as animal growing, allowing changes in size and shape of skull • Once adult size reached, sutures infiltrated with bone to form a single structural unit • Teeth reflect the animal’s diet Mandible • 2 bones, left and right • Joined at intermandibular joint • Fused with fibrocartilage suture, sometimes ossified (bony). Skull and mandible - canine Images by Helen Davies Bones of the skull Paired (left and right): • Incisive • Nasal • Maxillary • Lacrimal • Frontal • Parietal • Temporal (squamous, petrosal, tympanic) • Palatine • Pterygoid • Zygomatic • Mandible Unpaired: • Occipital • Sphenoid complex − basisphenoid − presphenoid • Vomer • Ethmoid From: Miller’s Anatomy of the Dog (4th edition)From: König & Liebich.

Image by Helen Davies Take home messages • The skeleton is divided into axial and appendicular parts • The appendicular skeleton contain the forelimbs and hindlimbs • Know the major forelimb bones and their relative positions • Know the major hindlimb bones and their relative positions • By knowing the skeleton of the dog, bones can be identified through their relative positions in other species • Know the names commonly applied to the bumps, grooves, and holes of bones.
