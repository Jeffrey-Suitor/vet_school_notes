Forces influencing bulk flow: Starling’s forces Four forces influencing bulk flow: Capillary Plasma colloid pressure osmotic pressure 1. Capillary blood pressure: hydrostatic pressure P TIp exerted on the capillary wall by the blood. Forces fluid out of capillary 2. Plasma colloid osmotic pressure (also known as T ‘ oncotic pressure): force caused by plasma proteins Interstitial Interstitial fluid which remain in plasma, which exerts an osmotic fluid pressure colloid osmotic pressure effect on water. Forces fluid into the plasma (Pif) (TTH) Guyton & it 2007 compartment . . 3.
