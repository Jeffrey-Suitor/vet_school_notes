The language of anatomy • To remove ambiguity, anatomical language has been internationally standardised • Facilitates clear communication – Between colleagues verbally – From written text e.g. textbooks, clinical case notes. • Nomina Anatomica Veterinaria (NAV), current revision 6th edition (2017) – Nomina Embryologica Veterinaria and Nomica Histologica Veterinaria also available • Guidelines that decide the name for an anatomical structure or concept (with the occasional exception): – the only term for this structure – in Latin (or the local language translation) – short, simple, easy to remember, descriptive and instructive – if differentiating adjectives are used for two or more structures, they are opposite e.g. superficial and deep – structures closely related in their anatomical position have similar names e.g. femoral nerve, artery and vein The language of anatomy • The words of veterinary anatomy come from many languages • Most are from Ancient Greek (Gr) or Latin (L) • Try to learn what common prefixes, suffixes, and root words mean • Breaking down new words into their parts usually helps understand and remember them • E.g. hypothermia ‘hypo-’ = below (Gr) ‘-thermia’ = heat (Gr) Names associated with tissues • Bones osteo- (Gr - bone), os (L - bone) • Joints arthr- (Gr - joint), articular (L - joint) • Cartilage chondro- (Gr - cartilage) • Muscles myo- (L – muscle, ‘a little mouse) • Ligaments -ligamentum (L - to tie, to bind) • Tendons tend- (G – tendon, to stretch) • Nerves neuro- (G – nerves, cord) • Veins phleb- (G – vein) • Skin -derm (G – skin, hide), cutaneous (L – the skin), -thelium • Blood haem- (Gr/L - blood) Common prefixes • Epi- (Gr – upon) epithelium, epiphysis • Peri- (Gr – around) pericardium, periosteum • Endo- (Gr – within) endothelium, endocrine • Dia- (Gr – between) diaphragm, diaphysis • Meta- (Gr – change/after) metabolism, metaphysis • Supra- (L – above) supracondylar • Infra- (L – beneath) infraspinous, infraorbital • Sub- (L – under) subcutaneous • Hypo- (Gr – below) hypoglycaemia, hypoglossal • Hyper- (Gr – over) hyperextension • Ad- (L – towards) adduction • Ab- (L – away) abaxial, abduction • Ante- (L – before) antebrachium • Anti- (Gr – against) antibiotic, anticlinal • A-/An- (Gr – not/without) anoestrous • Retro- (L – behind) retrobulbar • Di- (Gr –two) digastricus • Bi- (L – two) biceps brachii • Tri- (L & Gr – three) triceps brachii L– Latin Gr – Greek derivation Directional terms This is up • Everyday terms can lead to confusion, depending on how the animal or observer is positioned. • Standardized anatomical language uses directional terms relative to the animal’s body. • Still use left and right. − Remember, this is the animal’s left or right. Or is this up? From: Dyce, Sack & Wensing’s Textbook of Veterinary Anatomy (4th ed). Veterinary position terms are based on an upright, plantigrade stance. Dorsal (dorsalis in Latin, = back) - closer to the back, also known as the dorsum Ventral (ventralis in Latin, = belly) - closer to the belly, also known as the ventrum • applies to the entire body, expect for the limbs. Ways to use dorsal and ventral: e.g. the dorsal midline is the line that runs along the centre of the back, also known as the dorsum, shown in green. e.g. the ventral midline is the line that runs along the centre of the back, also known as the ventrum , shown in purple. e.g. the heart is located ventral to the two large veins of the body, the cranial and caudal vena cava (who’s names are explained more on future slides). Directional terms Ventral Dorsal Proximal (proximalis in Latin) Distal (distalis in Latin) - closer to the junction of - away from the junction the limb to the body the limb to the body • applies to the limbs and tail. Directional terms Distal Proximal carpus ‘wrist’ toes elbow Proximal femoral artery Distal femoral artery Ways to use proximal and distal: e.g. the proximal femoral artery is a blood vessel that leaves the major artery in the hindleg closer to the body compared to the distal femoral artery, which leaves the major hindleg artery further away from the body. e.g. the toes are distal to the elbow in the forelimb e.g. as you move proximally through the forelimb from the toes, you first encounter the carpus (‘wrist’), then the elbow. e.g. the dog has a cut in the skin on the distal third of their antebrachium (‘forearm’). Cut in skin Proximal Middle Distal Cranial (cranialis in Latin) Caudal (caudalis in Latin) (cranium = head, Gr) (cauda = tail, L) - closer to the head - closer to the tail • applies to the neck and trunk & to the limbs proximal to the carpus (‘wrist’) and tarsus (‘ankle’). Ways to use cranial and caudal: e.g. the cranial vena cava is cranial to the heart. e.g. the caudal vena cava is caudal to the heart. e.g. as you move cranially through the body from the tail, you will first encounter the caudal vena cava, then the heart, then the cranial vena cava. Directional terms Cranial Caudal carpus tarsus Dorsal (dorsalis in Latin) Palmar (palmaris in Latin) – forelegs only, ‘palm’ Plantar (plantaris in Latin) – hindlegs only • dorsal and palmar is used for the carpus and everything distal to it in the forelimb • dorsal and plantar is used for the tarsus and everything distal to it in the hindlimb Ways to use dorsal, palmar, and plantar: e.g. the digital pads are found on the palmar and plantar surfaces of the forelimbs and hindlimbs respectively. e.g. the dog has a cut in the skin on the dorsal surface of the carpus. carpus tarsus Dorsal Plantar Dorsal Palmar Cut in skin Digital padsDigital pads Digital pads Directional terms for the distal limbs Medial (medialis in Latin) - closer to the median plane (the ‘centre’ or ‘middle’ of the body) Lateral (lateralis in Latin) - closer to the side or flank of the body • applies to the whole body Ways to use medial and lateral: e.g. the hindlimbs are located lateral to the udder of a cow e.g. the first digit (dewclaw) is on the medial side of the limb e.g. the fifth digit is on the lateral side of the limb Special terms for sides of digits (other than the horse) Axial - near the ‘centre’ or axis of a limb Abaxial - away from the axis of a limb Directional terms Median plane Axial Abaxial Median plane of the body Medial Lateral Digit I Digit II Digit III Digit IV Digit V OR Medial Lateral For digits Long axis of a limb Medial Lateral From: Goody. Dog Anatomy (2nd ed). Superficial (superficialis in Latin) - closer to the surface of the skin Deep (profundus in Latin) - closer to the ‘centre’ of the body or limb, or further away from the skin surface Internal/inner and external are also used to describe a structure based on proximity to the body surface • applies to the entire body. e.g. the deep gluteal muscle is located next to the pelvis bone under several layers of tissue, while the superficial gluteal muscle is closer to the skin. e.g. the external ear is seen on the skin surface, while the inner ear is located within the skull. e.g. the internal obturator muscle is located on the inside of the pelvis, and the external obturator muscle is on the outside of the pelvis. Directional terms From: Goody. Dog Anatomy (2nd ed). Deep Superficial Internal External Rostral (rostralis in Latin) Caudal (caudalis in Latin) - closer to the nose (‘rostrum’) - closer to the tail Dorsal and ventral, medial and lateral, superficial and deep, internal and external used on head, same meanings as rest of body. Some eye and ear structures are the only place ‘human’ terms (anterior, posterior, superior, and inferior) apply in veterinary anatomy Ways to use rostral and caudal in the head: e.g. the whiskers are found more rostrally on the head compared to the eye. e.g. the nose is the most rostral body part of the dog. e.g. as you move caudally on the head of a dog from the nose, you will encounter the eye, then the ear.

Orthopedic Examination of the Forelimb in the Dog, NAVC Clinician’s Brief July 2008 p19-22 • Flexion - the angle between the bones at a joint becomes smaller • Extension - the angle between the bones at a joint approaches 180o (straight line) • Hyperextension - a joint travels beyond 180o in a continuation of the extension movement Describing movement From: DB Fox. Orthopedic Examination of the Rear Limb in the Dog, NAVC Clinician’s Brief July 2008 p63-66 & DB Fox. Orthopedic Examination of the Forelimb in the Dog, NAVC Clinician’s Brief July 2008 p19-22 Abduction Adduction • Adduction – joint movement such that a limb moves towards the midline of the body; (Latin - ‘ad’ = toward + ‘duction’ = bringing) hint: think the limb is being “added” to the body mass • Abduction – joint movement such that a limb moves away from the midline of the body; (Latin - ‘ab’ = away + ‘duction’ = bringing) Describing movement PronationSupination • Pronation – rotation of the manus (‘hand’) or pes (‘foot’) so the palmar/plantar surface turns toward the ground; (Latin - ‘pronate’ = lying face down) hint: think the palm is turning towards the ground • Supination – rotation of the manus (‘hand’) or pes (‘foot’) so the dorsal surface turns toward the ground; (Latin - ‘supinate’ = lay on the back) hint: think the palm is turning towards upwards and can now hold some ‘soup’! Example The cephalic vein crosses the palmar side of the distal third of the third and fourth metacarpal bones. It then courses proximally on the palmar side of the interosseous muscles and passes superficial to the flexor retinaculum parallel to the carpal canal. It then runs medially to the cranial surface of the antebrachium where it joins the accessory cephalic vein and continues proximally on the cranial surface of the extensor carpi radialis muscle to the flexor angle of the elbow joint. Example • The cephalic (L – pertaining to the head) vein crosses the palmar side of the distal third of the third and fourth metacarpal (meta = after + carpal – pertaining to the carpus (Gr wrist)) bones. • It then courses proximally on the palmar side of the interosseous (inter = between + osseous – pertaining to bones) muscles and passes superficial to the flexor (L – flex = bent) retinaculum (L – a rope cable) parallel to the carpal canal. • It then runs medially to the cranial surface of the antebrachium (ante = before + brachium L/Gr – arm) where it joins the accessory cephalic vein and continues proximally on the cranial surface of the extensor (L – extend = stretch out) carpi radialis (L – pertaining to the radius) muscle to the flexor angle of the elbow joint.
