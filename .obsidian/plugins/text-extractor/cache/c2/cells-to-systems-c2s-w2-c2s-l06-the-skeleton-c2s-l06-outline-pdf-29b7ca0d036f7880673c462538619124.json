K E Y W O R D S - Axial skeleton: skull, mandible, hyoid, vertebral column (cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral, caudal vertebrae), thoracic skeleton (thoracic vertebrae, ribs, sternum). - Appendicular skeleton: bones of the forelimb and hindlimb. - Bones of the forelimb: pectoral girdle (scapula, clavicle, coracoid), humerus, radius and ulna, carpal bones, metacarpal bones, digits (phalanges). - Bones of the hindlimb: pelvic girdle (ilium, ischium, pubis, acetabulum), femur, tibia and fibula, tarsal bones, metatarsal bones, digits (phalanges). - Features on bones: process, tuberosity, epicondyle; fossa, foramen, fissure, canal, duct, condyle, articular facet. - Specialised bones: sesamoids, splanchnic bones, pneumatic bones. L E C T U R E O V E R V I E W The skeleton serves to support the body and provide its basic shape, as well as anchor the leverage system used for locomotion and provide protection to delicate structures. Skeletal bones may be palpated or vizualised from the surface of the animal or identified on a radiograph. Thus, they offer consistent and accessible landmarks for the description of many other structures and for the location of internal organs or clinically relevant structures. The basic quadruped skeleton has been adapted in numerous ways to allow for flight, fast running, swimming, digging, and many other ways of life. This lecture introduces the bones that may be present and how to identify which bones are present in any animal skeleton. F U R T H E R R E A D I N G Studdart, Gay & Hinchcliff.
