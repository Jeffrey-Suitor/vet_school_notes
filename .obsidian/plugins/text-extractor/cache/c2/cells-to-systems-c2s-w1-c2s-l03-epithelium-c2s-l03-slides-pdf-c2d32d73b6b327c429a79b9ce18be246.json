Microvilli and stereocilia: • Non-motile, finger- or thread-shaped extensions of epithelial cells. • Their main function is to increase the surface area of cells active in absorption. • Microvilli are much shorter than stereocilia. 17 Lateral and basal surface specialisations Junctional complexes Occluding type • Tight junctions (zonulae occludens), connects adjacent cells; close to apical surface Adhering type • Desmosomes (maculae adherens) and zonulae adherens anchor cells to each other; connected to cytoskeleton • Hemidesmosomes connect cells to basement membrane Communicating type • Gap junction (nexus), allows movement of small molecules from one cell to an adjacent cell From: Eurell J. Veterinary Histology. Jackson, WY: Teton NewMedia, 2004 Summary Thank you 19 Glands • Glandular epithelial cells are specialised for secretion • Exocrine glands release the secretory product (e.g. milk, mucus, sweat) via a system of ducts that open onto of the surfaces of the body which are in contact with the external world (skin, respiratory tract, etc) • Endocrine glands release their secretory product (typically hormones) into the spaces between the secretory cells (extracellular space) from which it enters the bloodstream. • Glands are developmentally derived from epithelia that grow into the underlying connective tissue • Exocrine glands maintain the connection with the surface epithelium • The surface connection is lost in endocrine glands Gland development 20 Classification of exocrine glands Morphology Simple vs compound (ducts) Tubular vs alveolar/acinar (secretory units) Mode of secretion Merocrine Apocrine Holocrine Nature of secretion Mucous Serous Mixed 21 Exocrine glands –classification - morphology 22 Exocrine glands –classification - morphology Secretory cells may form • tubes in tubular glands • acini in acinar glands • alveoli in alveolar glands. 23 Exocrine glands –classification - morphology 24 Exocrine glands –classification - morphology Salivary gland Duct Acini 25 Exocrine glands –classification – mode of secretion • Merocrine  Salivary glands • Apocrine  Mammary glands • Holocrine  Sebaceous glands Identifier first line Second line Thank you!","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
