Water homeostasis is critical for life! Water comprises approx. 60% of BW istockphotos.com Body fluid compartments: overview Hall, 2016 Interstitial fluid Plasma Extracellular fluid Intracellular fluid Lymph Transcellular fluid (ef. CSF, synovial fluid) Body fluid compartments: ECF and ICF • Total body water (TBW) Ill 60% of lean body weight • 1/3 of TBW is extracellular  ¼ extracellular water = plasma  ¾ extracellular water = interstitial  Exchange of water, solutes, nutrients and gases occurs via diffusion and osmosis driven by hydrostatic and oncotic pressures • 2/3 of TBW is intracellular  Water, solutes, nutrients and gases must cross the cell membrane  Simple diffusion and osmosis occurs for some molecules  Additional transport mechanisms are required for others – next lecture 1/3 2/3 1/4 3/4 Guyton & Hall, 2007 70kg dog Capillary membrane: - H20 and most plasma constituents (except plasma proteins) freely exchanged Composition of plasma and interstitial fluid is similar - Plasma is the only fluid compartment that can be actively modified Cell membrane: - Highly selective, permits movement of some molecules but not others - Passive and active mechanisms – next lecture Composition of Body Fluid Compartments Extracellular fluid Intracellular fluid Blood plasma Interstitial fluid Intracellular fluid 1.0 litre* 3 litre* 8 litres* [Na+]= 153 mM [Na+]= 145 mM [Na+]= 10-15 mM [K+]= 4.7 mM [K+]= 4.5 mM [K+]= 120-140 mM [Cl-]= 110 mM [Cl-]= 116 mM [Cl-]= 20 mM Range 3-30mM [Ca2+]= 1.3 mM (ionized) [Ca2+]= 1.2 mM [Ca2+]=0.001 uM [Protein]= 1 mM Range 1-10 mM [Protein]= 0 mM [Protein]= 4 mM Range 4-50mM Osmolality=290mOsm/kg Osmolality=290mOsm/kg Osmolality=290mOsm/kg HCO3= 24 (mM) Also high in HCO3 Also high in phosphates & Mg2+ * For 20kg dog – this will vary with size of animal* Some fluid in transcellular compartments Clinical Assessment of Dehydration Clinical Sign Dehydration estimate (% BW) Normal <5% Dry mucous membranes 5% Reduced Skin turgor 6-8% Increased HR 8-10% Weak pulses 10-12% Collapse, shock 12-15% Clinical signs of dehydration Mucous membranes cliniciansbrief.com infovets.com atdove.org Skin tenting Pulse strength, HR Capillary membrane: - H20 and most plasma constituents (except plasma proteins) freely exchanged Composition of plasma and interstitial fluid is similar - Plasma is the only fluid compartment that can be actively modified Cell membrane: - Highly selective, permits movement of some molecules but not others - Passive and active mechanisms – next lecture Transport across membranes • Molecules or ions that are able permeate the plasma membrane unassisted will move passively across the membrane • Two forces involved in passive movement: 1. Diffusion down a concentration gradient 2. Movement along an electrical gradient Diffusion • Movement of a molecule down a concentration gradient – due to random molecular collisions • Where there is a membrane barrier and the substance can permeate the membrane, it will move from an area of high concentration to low concentration e.g. diffusion of oxygen from the lungs into the blood Fick’s equation Fick’s equation describes factors that influence the rate of net diffusion across a membrane: 1. Magnitude of concentration gradient  Greater the difference in concentration, faster the rate of net diffusion 2. Permeability of the membrane to the substance  Greater the permeability, faster the rate of net diffusion 3. Surface area of membrane available for diffusion  Larger the surface area, faster the rate of net diffusion 4. Molecular weight of substance  Heavier the molecule, the slower the rate of net diffusion 5. Distance of diffusion  Greater the distance, the slower the rate of net diffusion Osmosis: • Specific type of diffusion • Flow of water across a membrane that is permeable to water but not to solutes • Water is a small polar molecule  Passes through lipid bilayer of cell membrane  Also passes through channels (aquaporins) in cell membrane Water passes by osmosis from a region of higher water concentration to a region of lower water concentration (i.e. higher solute concentration) net diffusion of water down it’s own concentration gradient Costanzo, 2013 1. Pure water  Semipermeable membrane  Constant movement of water molecules, but no net diffusion or flux of water 3 Osmotic pressure  Amount of pressure required to stop osmotic water movement 2. Presence of solute produces directional water movement  Reduces water concentration → watermoves by osmosis to area of lower water concentration (higher solute concentration) • ‘Water follows salt’ 1 2 3 Osmosis: net diffusion of water down it’s own concentration gradientMaintaining fluid balance • ECF volume and ECF osmolarity are tightly regulated • Maintenance of ECF volume critical for blood pressure – this will be discussed in cardiovascular unit • Maintenance of ECF osmolarity critical to prevent swelling/shrinking of cells (due to osmosis) Tonicity • Tonicity is the effect the solution has on cell volume • Determined by the concentration of non-penetrating solutes Tonicity Isotonic • Concentration of solutes on both sides of the membrane is equal • No net movement of water occurs Hypertonic compartment or solution • Osmotic pressure of the solution outside the cells is higher than the osmotic pressure inside the cells • Net movement of water out of cell → cell shrinks & crenates Hypotonic compartment or solution • Osmotic pressure of solution outside of the cells is lower than the cytoplasm of the cells • Net movement of water into cell → cell expands, can cause lysis Why understand tonicity?

CSF, synovial fluid) Cardiovascular System • The heart - the driving force propels blood around the body • Arterial system the distribution channels • The microcirculation the exchange vessels • The venous system the blood reservoirs, return blood to the heart Overview: functions of blood vessels http://www.cvphysiology.com/Blood%20Pressure/BP019.htm FUNCTIONAL GROUP FUNCTION Conducting arteries Elastic arteries that act as a pressure reservoir – elastic recoil continues driving blood forward during diastole Distributing arteries Primary role to conduct flow to smaller arteries, can change diameter actively Resistance vessels Control local blood flow to tissues. Main source of peripheral resistance, control arterial pressure Exchange vessels Site of metabolic exchange. Low resistance, high cross-sectional area to facilitate exchange Capacitance vessels Act as a reservoir of blood, stabilise and regulate venous return to the heart Capillaries: sites of exchange • Exchange of fluid (nutrients & metabolic products) between blood and interstitial fluid • Capillary walls are made up of a single layer of endothelial cells (~2μm thick) • Capillaries are located close to every cell in body (30- 100µm distance) Boron & Boulpaep, 2012 Types of capillaries Continuous: • Muscle • Skin • Lung • Fat • Connective tissue Contain narrow junctions (clefts) & small, coated pits (caveolae) Fenestrated: • Kidneys • Intestines • Endocrine glands • Joints Contain pores or fenestrae – permeable to small molecules Discontinuous: • Bone marrow • Liver • Spleen Wide gaps between endothelial cells – permeable to large molecules Modified from Boron & Boulpaep, 2012 Neural: • Brain Endothelial cells fused together by tight junctions and covered by thick basement membrane and astrocyte processes. Water diffuses, solutes require specific transport Movement of substances across capillary walls 1. Diffusion • Lipid-soluble molecules cross EC membranes • Lipid-insoluble molecules pass between ECs and through pores • Rate of diffusion described by Fick’s Law 2. Transcytosis or pinocytosis 3. Bulk flow via Starling’s Forces – driving force • Bulk flow of fluid through channels in capillary wall – molecules moving together in bulk • Transfer of water and dissolved substances across capillaries depends on net hydrostatic and osmotic forcesModified from Rhoades & Pflanzer 2003 Water channel or pore • Movement of macromolecules across ECs in vesicles Guyton & Hall, 2007 NFP = (Pc + ∏if) – (Pif + ∏p) Filtration forces Absorption forces Forces influencing bulk flow: Starling’s forces Four forces influencing bulk flow: 1. Capillary blood pressure: hydrostatic pressure exerted on the capillary wall by the blood. Forces fluid out of capillary 2. Plasma colloid osmotic pressure (also known as oncotic pressure): force caused by plasma proteins which remain in plasma, which exerts an osmotic effect on water. Forces fluid into the plasma compartment 3. Interstitial fluid pressure: hydrostatic pressure exerted by the interstitial fluid on the outside of the capillary wall. Forces fluid into capillaries. 4. Interstitial fluid colloid osmotic pressure: the protein concentration in the interstitium is normally very low, and so this force is close to zero. Guyton & Hall, 2007 Net filtration pressure (NFP) is the difference between forces driving fluid from the capillary to interstitial fluid and forces driving fluid from interstitial fluid into the capillary Forces influencing bulk flow: Starling’s forces NFP = (Pc + ∏if) – (Pif + ∏p) Filtration forces Absorption forces Filtration is greatest at the arterial end of the capillary • Hydrostatic forces favouring filtration are greatest at the arterial ends of capillaries • Oncotic osmotic pressure predominates at the venous ends of the capillaries ensuring 90% of the fluid is reabsorbed → this creates a filtration- absorption imbalance Rhoades & Pflanzer, 2003 Lymphatic system: role in fluid balance • In normal circumstances, slightly more fluid is filtered out of capillaries than is reabsorbed back into plasma • This ‘extra’ fluid is picked up by the lymphatic system, and is called ‘lymph’ • Lymphatic system returns this extra interstitial fluid to the blood Lymphatic system •Extensive network of one-way vessels •Functions as a tissue drainage system and is responsible for returning excess interstitial fluid back to the venous circulation FUNCTIONS: 1. Return of excess filtered fluid to the bloodstream 2. Defence against disease: lymph passes through lymph nodes located within the lymphatic system 3. Transport of absorbed fat: fat absorbed in the GI system is unable to access capillaries but can enter initial lymphatics 4. Return of filtered proteins: when plasma proteins do leak from capillaries, they travel within the lymphatics back to the intravascular space Lymphatic system: structure • Lymphatic capillaries form plexuses that give rise to larger lymphatic vessels • These converge into large trunks which open into the major veins in the thorax • Lymph nodes are placed along lymph pathways – lymph passes through a node before entering the blood stream • In lymph nodes, it is exposed to lymphocytes and phagocytes → provides for immune surveillance Oedema • Oedema: the accumulation of excess body fluid → can be ECF or ICF • Intracellular oedema: due to physical damage to cell membrane or failure of cell metabolism leading to excessive Na+ and water entry • Extracellular oedema: accumulation in interstitial tissues or in body cavities Guyton & Hall, 2007 Extracellular oedema is caused by a disturbance in Starling’s forces Causes of extracellular oedema Five major mechanisms of extracellular odema: 1. Increased plasma hydrostatic pressure 2. Decreased plasma colloid oncotic pressure 3. Lymphatic obstruction (= lymphoedema) 4. Increased vascular permeability 5. Sodium retention Example: Bee stingLymphoedema • Impairment of lymphatic drainage causes lymphoedema upstream • Generally localised to the drainage field of the damaged/obstructed area • Can be caused by damage to, or obstruction of, lymphatic vessels or nodes (trauma, inflammation, infection) Kang, 2007 Lecture 8: ILOs • Describe the major body fluid compartments and the composition of intracellular and extracellular body fluid • Explain how water and solutes traverse the capillary wall, using Fick’s equation and Starling’s hypothesis • Describe the organization of the cardiovascular and lymphatic systems and their role in fluid homeostasis • Explain the mechanisms underlying disruptions to fluid homeostasis including oedema and lymphoedema","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
