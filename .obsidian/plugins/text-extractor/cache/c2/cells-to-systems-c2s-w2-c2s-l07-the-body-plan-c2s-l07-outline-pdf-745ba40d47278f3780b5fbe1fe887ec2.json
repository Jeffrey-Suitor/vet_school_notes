K E Y W O R D S - Body regions: pectoral limb, pelvic limb, head, neck, thorax, abdomen, pelvis. - Body cavities: thoracic/abdominal/pelvic - Relationships of generalised body systems (musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, lymphatic, nervous, integument) and body systems with a restricted range (respiratory, digestive, urinary, reproductive, endocrine). - Specific structures/organs: heart, aorta, carotid artery, jugular vein, cranial vena cava, caudal vena cava, portal vein, brain, spinal cord, spleen, trachea, lungs, diaphragm, tongue, teeth, oesophagus, liver, stomach, intestines, kidneys, bladder, male and female reproductive tract. L E C T U R E O V E R V I E W The organs and structures of the body can be categorised into ten body systems based on a common function, and often a similar structure and origin. Each system can be studied individually, called a systematic approach, which provides insight into the normal physiology of the system, as well as the disease processes that affect it. The systematic approach does not illustrate the relationships between structures within different systems in the same body region or provide approaches to specific structures in the living animal. To understand these relationships and approaches, the ability to identify a structure’s location in relation to other structures within the same system and with structures from other systems is needed. This lecture provides an overview of the relative positions and extent of the different body systems and highlights the important structures.
