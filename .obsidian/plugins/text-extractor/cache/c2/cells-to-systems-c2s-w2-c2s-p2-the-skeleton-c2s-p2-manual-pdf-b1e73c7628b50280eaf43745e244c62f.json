The answers to the questions in this practical class may be found in the lecture notes, these notes, the computer slides, the references, or may be deduced from careful observation. Not all questions will have a single “correct” answer. These questions are to encourage you to practice answering questions using logic, observation, deduction, and your own knowledge as this is a critical skill in veterinary practice. 11 PART 1. THE APPENDICULAR SKELETON The appendicular skeleton consists of the bones of the forelimbs and hindlimbs. For the activities in part 1, use the boxes of loose canine bones. For each major bone, establish their correct anatomical relationships and the side from which they came. Check the correctness of your conclusions about a particular bone by comparing it with the mounted skeletons and articulated limb. Forelimb The Pectoral Girdle A ‘girdle’ refers to the set of bones which attach a limb to the axial skeleton. The pectoral girdle, which connects the forelimb to the axial skeleton, comprises the scapula, coracoid, and clavicle in the ‘universal’ tetrapod body plan. These bones meet at the shoulder joint. In the domestic species, the scapula is the only fully developed bone of the pectoral girdle. The scapula in quadrupeds is a flat bone that lies laterally against the rib cage and extends caudally and dorsally from the shoulder joint. This shape provides a large surface area for muscle attachment while minimizing bone mass. In the dog, the clavicle is present as a small piece of cartilage and tendon (the clavicular intersection). In cats, this intersection often contains a small vestigial clavicle bone. The coracoid is reduced to a small protuberance, the coracoid process of the scapula. When the number of bones is reduced through evolution, the reduced bones may remain as a separate centre of ossification attached to adjacent bones. A centre of ossification is the site within a bone where bone formation begins in the foetus. Cartilage fills the gaps between the centres of ossifications. Bone continues to expand from this centre of ossification in young animals until the cartilage is completely replaced by bone at which point the bone is fully formed. This becomes important information when examining radiographs. In young growing animals, the cartilage between the centres of ossification (which are black on radiographs compared to the white colour of bone) need to be distinguished from fracture lines (also black) to ensure a correct diagnosis is reached. Names such as “coracoid process of the scapula” give a clue to expect an extra centre of ossification. Why? .……………………………………………………………………….. .………………………………………… Examine the orientation and relationships of bones in the canine forelimb using the articulated dog skeletons and the loose bones from the boxes. Using the language of anatomy and the diagrams provided, identify these features on the dog bones. They will be used in the comparative exercise later. Scapula: glenoid cavity, spine, acromion. Humerus: head, neck, greater and lesser tubercles, intertubercular groove, deltoid tuberosity, medial and lateral epicondyles. Radius Ulna: olecranon, anconeal process, lateral and medial coronoid processes. 12 Hindlimb The Pelvic Girdle The pelvic girdle consists of the os coxae, which is comprised of the left and right hip bones. Each hip bone is composed of four fused bones in the dog – the ilium, ischium, pubis, and acetabular bone. In an anatomically precise way, the term ‘pelvis’ refers to the pelvic region – both the os coxae and the sacrum together as well as the pelvic canal – and the ‘bony pelvis’ refers to the sacrum and ox coxae together. However, ‘pelvis’ in common usage refers to the os coxae. Examine the orientation and relationships of bones in the canine hindlimb using the articulated dog skeletons and the loose bones from the boxes. Locate the following boney features to practice applying the language of anatomy and to prepare for the later comparative exercise: Pelvis: pelvic canal, pelvic inlet, pelvic outlet, acetabulum, wing of ilium, iliac crest, ischiatic tuberosity, pubic symphysis. Femur: head, neck, greater and lesser trochanters, lateral and medial condyles, intercondylar fossa, extensor fossa. Patella (one of the sesamoid bones of the stifle joint) Tibia: tibial tuberosity. Fibula Manus and Pes Familiarise yourself with the arrangement of the bones of the manus (forefoot) and pes (hindfoot) of the dog by examining the mounted specimens, including the exploded manus and pes, and by consulting references. Carpals and tarsals: Note how many rows there are and how many bones are in each row. Observe their appearance on the radiographs - can you distinguish individual bones on the radiographs? Metacarpals, metatarsals, and phalanges: Note how many metacarpals and metatarsals are present compared to the number of digits. How many phalanges are in each digit? Sesamoids: Note which joints they are associated with. Identify them on a radiograph of these regions. Sesamoids are easily lost during the preparation of a mounted skeleton so there may be less bones on the mounted skeletons than observed in radiographs. It is important to be aware of the normal position, size, and number of sesamoids so they are not mistaken for fractures or abnormal bone fragments. As sesamoids occur in specific locations, it should be possible to recognise them as sesamoids with careful examination, even in an animal you have not encountered before. As with centres of ossification described above, a radiograph of the contralateral limb can help determine what is normal for that animal. You may find it helpful to label the images on the following pages. Remember to include the aspect and whether it is the left or right limb. 13 14 15 16 Limb function Fit a humerus, radius, and ulna together. Manipulate the bones to explore how particular movements are facilitated or limited by the articular surfaces and neighbouring features of bone structure. Consider how they may be involved in movements of the limbs. Think about how the forces of body support and locomotion may be distributed through these bones and identify potential areas of weakness. Where might you expect the humerus to break? What sort of force might make it crack? ……………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………. Where might you expect the bones that form the elbow joint to break? ……………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………. PART 2. THE AXIAL SKELETON The axial skeleton consists of the bones running along the long axis of the body. It consists of the fused bones of the skull, the mandibles, hyoid apparatus, vertebral column, ribs, and sternum. The skull The skull is examined Practical 1 in the Digestive System subject. Skeleton of the vertebral column The skeleton of the vertebral column – also known as the back or spine – has 5 regions: cervical (neck), thoracic (chest), lumbar (abdomen), sacral (pelvic), and caudal (tail). Label each region on the diagram. Identify the following vertebral features and label the vertebra diagram below (from: de Lahunta & Evans. Miller’s Anatomy of the Dog). • Body • Vertebral arch • Vertebral foramen • Spinous process • Transverse process • Articular process • Costal fovea – see skeleton of the thorax section below for more information about costal fovea. 17 You should be able to identify the region from which any vertebra comes, using the vertebrae features characteristic to each region. For example, the average size of spinous, transverse, and articular processes in each region are different sizes. You should also be able to recognise the atlas, axis, anticlinal vertebra, and sacrum by name. Using either the bone racks or one of the mounted specimens, examine a representative vertebra (usually a mid-region vertebra) from the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar regions. Which region has the longest spinous processes? ……………..……………………………………………. Which region has the longest transverse processes? …………………………..……………………………. The sacrum is the bone formed by the fusion of the sacral vertebrae. The dog has 3 sacral vertebrae in its sacrum. Using your knowledge of vertebrae features such as spinous processes, intervertebral discs, and vertebral foramina, determine the correct orientation of the sacrum and position it within the ox coxae. Each vertebra articulates with the vertebrae on either side of it. Caudal to C2, this articulation involves a fibrocartilagenous intervertebral disc between the vertebral bodies and synovial joints between the articular processes on the left and right of each vertebra. The synovial joints fit together so that each successive vertebra supports the one cranial to it, including C1 supporting the skull. Observe how the orientation of these articular surfaces changes as you move caudally through the vertebral column. Skeleton of the thorax The skeleton of the thorax comprises the thoracic vertebrae, the ribs, and the sternum. The ribs connect the vertebral column and the sternum, forming a protective yet movable cage that facilitates the breathing movements of the chest while safeguarding the lungs and heart within the thoracic cavity. Identify the bones of the thorax in the following drawing. Which non-thorax bones are present? Name some features that would help you to identify a particular area of the thorax on a radiograph. How might you find these in a live dog? ……………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………. ……………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………. 18 The thoracic vertebrae are the vertebrae that articulate with the ribs. What features help to distinguish thoracic vertebrae from lumbar or cervical vertebrae? ……………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………. …………………………………………………………………………………………………………….……………… How many thoracic vertebrae are there in the dog? …………………………………………………………………………………………………………….…………… When the soft tissues are present to connect the bones normally, what movements do you think the rib can make?...………………………………………………………………………………………………….……………… …………………………………………………………………………………………………………….……………… Can you feel the movements of your ribs against your spine? You may need assistance from a friend to feel this. When you get the chance, try to feel these movements in a quadruped e.g. a dog, cat, or horse. Which way do the ribs move in relation to the spine when breathing in?......................................................... And when breathing out?......................................................... The rib movements change the volume of the thoracic cavity. When the thoracic cavity is intact and sealed, pressures different to the atmospheric pressure can be maintained inside the thoracic cavity, air can be drawn into or pushed out of the lungs. Each rib articulates with two thoracic vertebrae in multiple places. The more cranial vertebra has a crater called the caudal costal fovea, as it is on the caudal edge of the vertebral body, and the caudal vertebra has a crater called the cranial costal fovea on the cranial edge of its vertebral body. Together these two foveae form the cup that holds the head of the rib. Travelling distally, the rib narrows to a neck then enlarges again to form the bulge of the tubercle of the rib. The tubercle articulates with a fovea on the transverse process of the vertebra. Using your knowledge of anatomical language, find the angle, the body, the costochondral junction, and the costal cartilage on a rib bone. The costal arch forms the caudal edge of the rib cage. It is the arch formed by the last rib and the successive costal cartilages that connect to the sternum. Feel your costal arch and compare its shape to the domestic species. If you palpate carefully, you should be able to feel the sequence of costal cartilages that connect to each other to form the costal arch. The sternum consists of a chain of bones called sternebrae. The first (most cranial) is the manubrium and the last (most caudal) has a xiphoid process that supports the flat plate of the xiphoid cartilage. Label these bones and cartilage on the drawing of the thorax above. 19 PART 3. COMPARATIVE ANATOMY Domestic species In the articulated limbs or the loose bones from the domestic species, observe the differing sizes and shapes of the limb bones as well as the features that you identified above. Scapula: glenoid cavity, spine, acromion. Humerus: head, greater and lesser tubercles, deltoid tuberosity, medial and lateral epicondyles. Radius Ulna: olecranon, anconeal process, lateral and medial coronoid processes. Examine the size of the ulna and radius relative to each other and to the humerus, the degree of fusion between the ulna and radius in the various domestic species. Pelvis: acetabulum, wing of ilium, iliac crest, ischiatic tuberosity, pubic symphysis. Femur: head, greater and lesser trochanters, lateral and medial condyles. Pay particular attention to the differing height of the greater trochanter between species. Tibia: tibial tuberosity Fibula Examine the size of the tibia and fibula relative to each other and to the femur, the degree of fusion between the tibia and fibula in the various domestic species. Metacarpus / tarsus: in each species: - which bones are present? - which bones are fused? - through careful observation, can you differentiate between the metacarpal and metatarsal bones in the ox and the horse? And left from right? Phalanges: in each species: - how many digits present? - which digits are weight bearing? - number of phalanges per digit? - shape of the distal phalanx (P3)? - number and location of proximal and distal sesamoid bones (particularly in the horse)? Examine the radiographs of the equine distal limb. Identify the 3 phalanges and associated sesamoids. 19 These images are from which species? Label the aspects shown. Non-domestic species Observe the pectoral and pelvic limb bones of the non-domestic species in the OBLA and in the document on Canvas e.g. elephant, giraffe, marsupial. In the different species, compare the key bones and features that you are now familiar with. Some of the features are either enormously enlarged or absent. What differences you can observe? Many differences occur in the pectoral girdle, which can be related to the many and varied uses of the forelimb in different species e.g. flying, digging, running. The scapula is present in all species. In what animals does the scapula appear more tubular than flattened?........................................................... When the clavicle is present, it extends medially and ventrally towards the ventral midline and may articulate with the manubrium of the sternum. When the coracoid is present, it extends medially, caudally, and ventrally towards the midline and may articulate with sternum. The coracoid and clavicle are only fully developed in reptiles, flying birds and monotremes. Which of the 3 pectoral girdle bones do humans have?....………………………………………………………… Also observe the different shapes and amounts of fusion in the ribs and sternum on mounted specimens. Can you relate any of the observed differences to the lifestyle or habitat of the animal? Do these features provide any advantages for locomotion or other functions? ………...……………………………………………………………………………………………………………. …...…...……………………………………………………………………………………………………………. …………...…………………………………………………………………………………………………………. …………...………………………………………………………………………………………………………….","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
