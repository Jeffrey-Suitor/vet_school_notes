Keywords congenital, agenesis, aplasia, hypoplasia, dysplasia, atresia, atrophy, ceroid lipofuscin, ageing, abiotrophy Lecture Overview Many disorders of veterinary importance involve abnormalities of cell and tissue growth and/or differentiation. These conditions may result in excess tissue mass, a deficit of tissue, or an abnormal pattern of tissue growth. Some of these conditions manifest at birth (as congenital malformations) whereas others are acquired later. In this lecture we will examine developmental disorders of tissue mass, using a range of veterinary examples: agenesis, aplasia, hypoplasia, dysplasia and atresia. The concept of cell and tissue atrophy (a decrease in cell size or tissue mass after normal growth has been achieved) will then be discussed, including the gross, microscopic and ultrastructural appearance of atrophic tissues and the causal mechanisms responsible for atrophy. Pertinent veterinary examples of both physiological and pathological atrophy of tissues will be presented, including the mechanisms that contribute to atrophy of tissues and organs during the process of ageing.
