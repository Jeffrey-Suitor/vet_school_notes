Why are purebred animals most often affected? • Why can some animals have a hereditary deficiency of a particular coagulation factor and either never bleed excessively or suffer only from minor haemorrhage? • Which of the inherited coagulopathies predispose to severe haemorrhage? • Why do haemophilia A and B mainly affect male animals? • Which coagulation factors are deficient in the inherited coagulopathy recognised in Devon rex cats? • What role does vitamin K play in hepatic synthesis of coagulation factors? Which are the vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors? • What is the MOST COMMON cause of vitamin K antagonism in domestic animals? • How can large animal species become poisoned by coumarin-type anticoagulants? • Why do the more potent anticoagulant rodenticides pose a greater hazard to small animals than does warfarin? • In what circumstances might a dog develop deficiency of vitamin K? How common is vitamin K deficiency? • What role does the liver play in haemostasis? • How much of the hepatic functional mass needs to be compromised before an animal is likely to be predisposed to haemorrhage due to inadequate synthesis of coagulation factors? • In which condition is excessive fibrinolysis a contributor to defective secondary haemostasis in domestic animals? • In which conditions is excessive fibrinogenolysis thought to be a contributor to defective secondary haemostasis in domestic animals?
