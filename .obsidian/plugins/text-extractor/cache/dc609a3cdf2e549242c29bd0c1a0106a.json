Vaccination Example primary sequence vaccination protocol – SE Australia A vaccination protocol where triennial vaccines are used could be: • 6-8 wks Distemper, Hepatitis and Parvovirus (C3) • 12-14 wks Distemper, Hepatitis, Parvovirus, Parainfluenza virus, Bordetella bronchiseptica (C5) • 16-18 wks Distemper, Hepatitis, Parvovirus, Parainfluenza virus, Bordetella bronchiseptica (C5) • 12 months after 3rd puppy vaccination Distemper, Hepatitis, Parvovirus, Parainfluenza virus, Bordetella bronchiseptica (C5) Vaccination DHP/C3 vaccines can be annual or triennial • There are vaccines with different durations of immunity for distemper, hepatitis and parvovirus i.e. the core vaccines • Some require annual boosters e.g. Protech C3 • Others are given triennially e.g. Nobivac DHP Vaccination Respiratory vaccines are different Vaccines for parainfluenza virus and Bordetella bronchiseptica MUST be given annually. www.hallvet.com.au Image:rockhallveterinary.ie Vaccination Example adult vaccination protocol • 12 months after 3rd puppy vaccination Distemper, Hepatitis, Parvovirus, Parainfluenza virus, Bordetella bronchiseptica (C5) • 2 years old - Parainfluenza virus, Bordetella bronchiseptica i.e. respiratory component • 3 years old - Parainfluenza virus, Bordetella bronchiseptica • 4 years old - Distemper, Hepatitis, Parvovirus, Parainfluenza virus, Bordetella bronchiseptica (C5) Vaccination Dogs first vaccinated as adults or with an unknown vaccination status should be given 2 doses 4-6 weeks apart. Not considered fully protected until 10 days after the last dose, although they could potentially have naturally acquired immunity. https://www.aler.si/novice-in- nasveti/preventivna-cepljenja-pri-psih Vaccination • Many non-core vaccines are used in different parts of the world • Rabies is one of the most common and is a legal requirement in many places as it is a potentially fatal zoonotic disease (exotic to Australia) • Leptospirosis is also commonly given across the world e.g. recommended in Singapore, Hong Kong, Nth America https://www.valleyvet.com/c/pet-supplies/dog- vaccines/dog-rabies-vaccines.html Vaccination – many non-core vaccines • HK • DHPPiL - all dogs yearly • Rabies required by law • Multivalent Leptospirosis - outdoor dogs • Bordetella – socialising/boarding dogs Vaccination – example protocol for Hong Kong vs Singapore • Singapore • DHP • Multivalent Leptospirosis – dogs visiting bushland • Bordetella/Pi – socialising/boarding dogs • Rabies exotic – NOT required https://vet-uk.virbac.com/home/products/dogs/vaccines/canixin-dhppil.html Vaccination – American Kennel Club https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/health/puppy-shots-complete-guide/ Gastrointestinal parasites Roundworms (mostly Toxocara canis) - greatest concern in young puppies as can be transferred in utero or in milk. Diagnose by finding eggs or adults in faeces or presumptive diagnosis in pot-bellied puppies or kittens Image:researchgate.net Endoparasites - gastrointestinal Roundworms – clinically signs much more common in puppies. Encysted larvae long-term issue in breeding bitches Hookworms – attach to wall of SI and feed on blood. Diagnose by faecal exam Whipworms – attach to the wall of LI. Diagnose by finding eggs in faeces Tapeworms – In urban areas most common species is Dipylidium caninum (flea tapeworm). Fleas act as intermediate host. In rural areas, hydatid tapeworm (Echinococcus granulosis) is common and a significant zoonosis A common intestinal worming protocol would be to treat every 2 weeks until 12 weeks, then monthly until 6 months, then 3 monthly for life. Up until 12 weeks it is common to use a product that only treats intestinal worms and often in a syrup formulation as it is easier to dose a small puppy At 2nd or 3rd vaccination, puppies often start on one of the combination parasiticides (discussed later in this video) https://www.budgetpetproducts.com.au Gastrointestinal parasites Carried between dogs by mosquitoes so doesn’t require contact with other dogs Until the age of 6 months, puppies can be started on heartworm medication without being tested. http://www.ehrdogs.org/ http://www.petvetinc.com/pet-owner-information/heart- worm-disease/ Heartworm • Most common choices for preventatives are: • annual injection • monthly treatment (oral or topical) http://www.nexgardspectra.com.au/about-nexgard-spectra http://www.walkervillevet.com.au/pet-care- advice/dogs/heartworm-flea-and-worm-protection-for- dogs/ Heartworm Animals which have not consistently been on prevention from puppyhood should be tested for heartworm before starting or resuming prevention. https://www.idexx.com/small-animal-health/products-and- services/snap-heartworm-rt-test.html Endoparasites - heartworm • The most significant problem with fleas in very young puppies is anaemia, also occasionally seen in adult dogs Fleas https://www.dileyvet.com/flea-anemia/ https://dogsfirst.ie/health-issues/dog-hot-spot/ • The most significant problem with fleas in very young puppies is anaemia, also occasionally seen in adult dogs Fleas https://www.cdc.gov/fleas/avoid/on_pets.html https://www.animalclinicofbillings.com/ preventative-care/preventing-and- treating-fleas-and-ticks-on-dogs/ https://www.pdsa.org.uk/pet-help-and- advice/pet-health-hub/conditions/fleas- on-dogs Fleas https://www.thevetshed.com.au/buy/re volution-teal-6pk-dogs-20-40kg/REVT6 https://www.petcircle.com.au/product/sentinel- spectrum-chews-large-blue ChewSpot on Tablet from 4 weeks of age 3 species of ticks found on dogs in Victoria • Important one currently is the paralysis tick (Ixodes holocyclus) • Brown dog tick can carry Ehrlichia canis, a bacterium which can cause serious disease.

Often done around 6 months but can be younger in shelter setting. Increasingly recommend later desexing (3 months after first heat) as it affects more than breedability e.g. growth plate closure, continence 3 main reasons to spay: • prevention of pregnancy • prevention of pyometra • significantly reduced risk of mammary tumours if spayed early If mature, check she is not in season. Desexing - spay Can be sexually mature from around 5 months although more commonly 6-12 months Have a bulbis glandis which swells during copulation, resulting in the copulatory tie Male reproduction https://cdn.citl.illinois.edu/courses/ansc207/week7/d og_repro/web_data/file3.htm Surgery is an orchectomy – removal of testes. Commonly done at about 6 months but some recommend to wait until 18 months when fully grown. Cryptorchid – one or both testes failed to descend. The retained testicle is significantly more likely to develop a testicular tumour than a descended testicle. Reasons to castrate: • prevention of unwanted offspring • prevention of testicular tumours • Decrease of aggression and roaming • Decrease in prostate and perianal tumours http://vetmedicine.about.com/od/veterinaryqa/ig/Dog- Neuter-Surgery/ Desexing - castration http://www.inverellvetclinic.com.au/I nverell/Desexing.aspxCompulsory – tattoo left ear http://www.dogslife.ac.uk/newsletter/view/10 http://www.bordercollie.org/boards/ index.php?showtopic=31922 As required – retained canines, hind dew claws, umbilical hernias http://www.meadowsvetclinic.com/ umbilical-hernia.html Procedures done at desexing http://www.monavalevet.com.au/VetServices/ MicrochippingRegistration http://www.microidglobal.com/pet-microchip-respect -your-pet/ http://www.vetstreet.com/our-pet- experts/why-microchipping-dogs-works Microchipping","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
