She has been involved in tuberculosis research in Uganda at the domestic-wildlife interface, neutering clinics in the Peruvian Amazon, and vaccination clinics in the informal settlements of Nairobi. She completed a Masters in Control of Infectious Disease in Animals at the Royal Veterinary College in London. Liz did a joint wildlife/anatomic pathology residency at Cornell University in Upstate New York, relocating to the Bronx Zoo, NYC for the final year of her residency with the Wildlife Conservation Society, and later became a board qualified veterinary pathologist in 2010. After returning to Australia in 2011, Liz worked as a veterinary pathologist for major veterinary diagnostic companies. liz.dobson@unimelb.edu.au I N T E N D E D L E A R N I N G O U T C O M E S At the end of this lecture, you should be able to: - Identify the more common disease conditions of the stomach/abomasum in domestic animals. - Outline the pathogeneses of common diseases of the stomach/abomasum in domestic animals. K E Y W O R D S Gastric dilatation, gastric impaction, gastric displacement, abomasal displacement, gastritis, gastric ulceration, pyloric stenosis. L E C T U R E O V E R V I E W In this lecture, we will overview various diseases of the stomach and abomasum. The stomach and abomasum can become enlarged with feed (impaction) or water, food and gas (dilation). The stomach and abomasum can also become displaced (GDV in dogs and abomasal displacement). Gastric ulceration is a common finding in a variety of species and can lead to pain, poor performance (horses) or production (livestock) and secondary infection. Gastritis is inflammation of the stomach wall and occurs due to a variety of reasons including Clostridium septicum infections in cattle, many chemicals, non- steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and uraemia. Unlike in humans, there is no proven association between Helicobacter spp infection and ulceration in domestic animals. Gastric/abomasal parasites are common in horses, cattle, sheep and goats and can cause death in severe cases. Adenocarcinomas, squamous cell carcinomas and lymphomas are the most important gastric neoplasms and will be discussed in this lecture. F U R T H E R R E A D I N G Zachary, J.
