KEYWORDS sodium, potassium, water, reabsorption, secretion, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), angiotensin II, aldosterone LECTURE 21 – STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF THE KIDNEYS 4 – RENAL CONTROL OF BLOOD VOLUME AND SODIUM, CHLORIDE AND POTASSIUM CONCENTRATIONS This lecture will look at how sodium concentrations and water movement are related to each other, how the kidney reabsorbs sodium in order to increase blood volume, the role and actions of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), and how the RAAS is activated to produce angiotensin II and aldosterone.
