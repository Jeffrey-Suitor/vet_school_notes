Veterinary Bioscience: Cells to Systems Where: Learning and Teaching building Room 331 and 410, Werribee When: Thursday 28th April 2023 Group A: 2-3.30 (Gross) & 3.30- 5.00 pm (Histo) Group B: 2-3.30 (Histo) & 3.30- 5.00 pm (Gross) 2 Practical Class 5 – Degeneration and Necrosis This practical class provides the opportunity to view and manipulate a collection of fixed (preserved) wet specimens and museum pots that illustrate animal diseases characterised by tissue degeneration as well as cellular degeneration and cell necrosis. Short videos discussing the more important specimens in this set will also be available via Canvas. The museum pots and wet specimens will be accompanied by laminated sheets that pose a series of questions relating to each specimen. The questions will prompt you to describe accurately and concisely the gross abnormalities you can see and/or feel, to practise constructing a morphological diagnosis, and to apply the knowledge that you have gleaned from the relevant lectures to speculate as to the possible disease processes involved, their causes and potential consequences. Answers to these questions will be provided during the class and will be made available for download from Canvas to aid your revision. For the wet specimen component of this class, you are expected to wear appropriate clothing (fully enclosed, water-proof shoes). A clean laboratory coat and gloves will be provided. Some of the fixed specimens may emit formalin fumes. If any student is affected adversely by these fumes, he or she should notify an attending staff member. During the histopathology class, you will have the opportunity to view digitised histological tissue sections in the SLICE platform via the BEST network. The purpose of the histopathology class is to deepen your understanding of how the various disease processes can alter tissue structure (and hence function) at the light microscopic level, and to allow extrapolation from the gross to the microscopic appearance of lesions and vice versa. Short videos outlining the important features of these slides will be available via Canvas. Information on how to access the histopathology slides will be provided through Canvas before the practical class.

What is the gross appearance of a liver with hepatic steatosis/lipidosis? What are the main causes of hepatic lipidosis? Describe the process (pathogenesis) of lipid accumulation in the liver. What other organs or systems are commonly affected by lipid degeneration? Give examples. 4 Degeneration Slide 3 Feline Liver - Hepatomegaly Go to https://slice.edu.au/s/d23af689 Name the different types of amyloidosis and their causes. Find the following structures: - Portal triads - Bile ducts - Central vein - Hepatic arterial branch - Portal vein - Lymphatics Zoom in and look for the areas of pallor. Describe the location of the amyloid accumulation and what structures are affected. What are the main effects of amyloidosis? 5 Degeneration and Necrosis Slide 4 Rat Liver – CCl4 Treatment 1 day prior Go to https://slice.edu.au/s/b3e0271f Look for evidence of degeneration and necrosis. Describe the histological differences between the degenerate cells and necrotic cells. Name the types of nuclear changes seen in a necrotic cell.
