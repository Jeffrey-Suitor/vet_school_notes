In addition, you will build on those activities at your instructor’s discretion and depending on your level of confidence. Activities and suggested progressions are listed here: • You may be asked to work with instructors to move the cows between the holding paddock and yards before and after your class • Moving cows from yards down the race and into the crushes • Use of the crush: catch a cow as they walk into the crush. • Approaching the cow in the crush: o From the side to identify and palpate all the external anatomical features on the side of the cow o From behind to take a temperature and observe the external anatomy of the hind end of the cow • Putting a halter on a cow in a crush o Place the halter on the cow o Restrain the head of the cow using the halter so that their ear tag can be read easily and safely* o Remove the halter safely • Weighing cattle • Calculating the dose for (based on the measured weight) and applying mock pour-on drench (this will just be water in the class) • Moving a small group of cows from one yard to another o You may now be asked to draft out a few cows from the group rather than moving all of them AND/OR o You may now be asked to draft out a few cows, including specific individuals and move them. Remember at all times: • Work quietly and calmly around the animals • Always touch the cow lightly and talk to it from a distance to let her know you are there before moving your body within striking distance. • Be aware of your own safety, the safety of your colleagues and the wellbeing of the cattle 3 Animal Handling Introduction - Cattle Preparation: • Use your Google skills to identify four different pour-on products for cattle that are available in Australia. You are not expected to understand the different parasites, diseases or active ingredients yet but consider broadly what these products are used for. • Watch this video as an example of how to use a pour-on drench (please ignore the fact that the doses are per pound, doses will always be per kilogram in Australia): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VD1WmlMNTNE *Securely restraining the head of a cow with a halter for examination or other procedures can be done either by someone holding the halter or by tying the end of the halter to the crush using a quick release knot. Please: o ask a demonstrator for help if required o review the knot-tying simulator activity for quick release knots here: Knot tying o remember the following points:  Secure the end of the halter to the crush at about the neutral level of the cow’s head or slightly higher for most routine purposes.  If the end of the halter is to be held manually, wrap it around a rail of the crush a couple of times to give greater security  ALWAYS use a quick release knot when tying a halter – if the animal goes down in the crush, the halter needs to be released quickly so that they are not left hanging from their head.  ***Even when the cow’s head is restrained in this manner, be careful not to put your own head in a position where it could be hit by the cow if the halter comes loose***","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
