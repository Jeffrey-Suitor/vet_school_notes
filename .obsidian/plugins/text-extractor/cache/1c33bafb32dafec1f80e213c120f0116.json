Can be caused by pruned garden plants during drought. Beef cattle condition score • Optimal CS to maintain cattle at various times of the year • Want animals in optimal score – not too heavy or light • Ideally keep between 2.5 and 3.5 • Depends on time of year and likely levels of feed in future e.g. start of Spring OK to be at lower end • CS is important determinant of when a beef cow will cycle after giving birth = longer time if lower CS • This is a greater challenge for autumn calving, needs supplementary feed (spring calving has increasing pasture) Supplementary feed • Need at least 30% roughage in diet (more than what is needed for sheep) – reduces acidosis • Types of supplements already covered under general heading: grains, hay, silage, straw and other • Standing feed over summer may also be included in supplementary feed • Takes 3-4 weeks to allow rumen gut microbes to get used to new feed types • Particularly important when changing to high starch diet e.g. grain https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0015/103506/full-hand-feeding-of-beef-cattle- management.pdf When are supplements needed…or not • Supplements might be needed any time through the year (varying with environment) • Generally associated with low/no production and/or drought • Interaction between condition score/pasture growth rate and pasture availability • Need to consider stocking rate, stock sales, agistment, lease etc • Need to plan multiple weeks/months in advance • Decision to stop supplements based on budgeting amount of pasture availability","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
