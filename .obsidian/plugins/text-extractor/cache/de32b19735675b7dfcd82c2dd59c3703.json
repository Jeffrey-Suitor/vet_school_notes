Aitken These notes have been edited from an original document created by Dr Cathy Beck. Here are some “rules” for assessing thoracic structures. However rather than being “rules” they are guidelines and must not be used in isola�on – make sure you read the en�re radiograph and interpret your ﬁndings in light of the history, physical examina�on and results of other tests. You will learn so much more about this in DVM3 and DVM4 so don’t panic. The “rules” provided here cover the pulmonary and cardiovascular structures. The introduc�on to imaging the respiratory system lectures will be delivered in Sept and October. Thoracic Radiology The phase of respira�on Dog and cat: • Inspira�on: The leading edge of diaphragm crosses spine at T12 on the lateral radiograph and T10 on a VD/DV projec�on • Expira�on: The leading edge of the diaphragm crosses spine at T8 on lateral and VD/DV projec�ons The pulmonary vascular structures • Veins are ventral and central Lateral projection The rules for the lateral projection are less helpful than the VD/DV projection Dog: • It is said that the ra�o of the diameter of the artery or vein to the proximal fourth rib at the level of the 4th ICS is 0.73 (+/-0.24). • The useful interpreta�on of that rules is that the vessels, at the 4th ICS, are considered enlarged when >1.2x the prox third of the 4th rib • Another rule: vessels should not be larger than the diameter of the prox third rib at the fourth ICS Cat: • Right cranial lobar artery should be 0.5-1.0 �mes the prox third of the fourth rib when measured at the fourth rib. • The cranial lobe veins should be 0.2cm in diameter at the same point as the above rule. Summary: Thoracic radiology and Imaging of the Heart VD/DV Dog and cat: • The pulmonary artery and vein of each caudal lobe should be similar in size. • The diameter of the artery or vein should be about the width of the 9th rib where they cross it, and no great than 1.2 x the width of the rib Cat: • A cut-oﬀ for pulmonary arterial enlargement of 1.6x the 9th rib has been suggested in an assessment of heartworm disease The Heart Canine cardiac size: rules of thumb • On a lateral view the cardiac length (ver�cal line from carina to sternum) should be approximately 70% of the dorsal to ventral distance of the thoracic cavity • On a lateral view the width (craniocaudal dimension) should be between 2.5 (deep chested breeds) and 3.5 (round chested breeds) intercostal spaces wide • Cardiac width on a DV view is usually 60-65% of the thoracic width and no more than 66% of the thoracic width at the widest point of the cardiac silhouete on a VD view • Sternal contact should be 2.5-3 sternebrae Feline cardiac size: rules of thumb • In cats the width of the cardiac silhouete should be no more than 2-2.5 intercostal spaces in width on the lateral view • On the lateral view the maximal width should be approximately the same as the distance between the cranial border of the ﬁ�h rib and the caudal border of the seventh rib Vertebral Heart Scale Dog: Original normal range: 9.7 vertebrae +/- 1 vertebrae however Buchanan and Buchler (JAVMA 1995) state that up to 11 vertebrae may be normal for some breeds. Cat: 6.9-8.1 Breed speciﬁc normal ranges have subsequently been published for many breeds. Use with cau�on and never use alone- make sure you read the radiograph using the rules above. The VHS has also been shown to be inﬂuenced by the phase of respira�on and cardiac cycle. Be careful of the VHS! Summary: Thoracic radiology and Imaging of the Heart Vertebral le� atrial size • Used in dogs with MMVD, and isn’t exposed to as much error as VHS • A VLAS >2.3 can be an indicator of le� atrial enlargement Summary of changes seen with cardiomegaly (dogs and cats unless indicated) Lateral projection: • Increased apicobasilar distance (>70% of dorsal to ventral distance of thoracic cavity) and reduc�on of distance between heart and spine • Eleva�on of trachea, rather than devia�ng from the thoracic spine it runs parallel to the thoracic spine • Ventral deﬂec�on of trachea at base of heart eliminated (dog) • Compression of lumina of stem bronchi by le� atrium (dog) • Increased craniocaudal diameter of heart (width) • Straightening of caudal heart border • Expansion of le� atrium into caudal lobar area (le� atrial wedge) • Cranial bulging of right heart border and increased sternal contact • Change in direc�on of CVC Ventrodorsal (dorsoventral projection) • Increased transverse diameter (width) of heart • Increased rounding and elonga�on of heart borders • Bulging of le� heart border due to increased size of le� auricle (dog) • Caudal and le�ward displacement of cardiac apex • “Valen�ne Shaped” heart (cat) • Lateral displacement of the caudal lobar bronchi (cowboy legs) due to enlarged L atrium Medias�num Dog: • The maximum width of the cranial medias�num on a VD/DV view should be less than twice the width of the vertebral column at this level Cat: • The cranial medias�num should be no wider than the width of the superimposed thoracic spine on the VD/DV Summary: Thoracic radiology and Imaging of the Heart Trachea Dog: Normal trachea diameter to thoracic inlet ra�o: • Meso- and longicephalic breeds: 0.21 (+/- 0.03) • Bulldogs: 0.11 (+/- 0.03) • Other brachycephalics: 0.16 (+/- 0.03) CVC • Variable size, but considered enlarged if consistently larger in diameter than the length of the 5th or 6th thoracic vertebral bodies on the lateral projec�on OR • If the diameter of the CVC is more than 1.5x the diameter of the descending aorta Basic echocardiography Please also refer to the prac�cal session notes and the ‘Introduc�on to Point of Care Ultrasound’ booklet released in weeks 3 and 4. When we use ultrasound to assess the heart, we can ‘slice through’ and see inside. This allows us to assess cardiac structure, chamber size, wall thickness, eﬃciency of contrac�lity, turbulent blood ﬂow (what we hear as murmurs) and overall func�on. With ultrasound, ﬂuid (blood) is ‘anechoic’ or black, and �ssue is described at levels of echogenicity (grey and white). B mode: produces a 2D cross sec�onal image of the heart and demonstrates cardiac morphology M mode: uses a single beam of ultrasound to display the echo as a distance-�me graph. It is useful �me dependent measurements such as chamber and wall dimensions. Doppler: uses the Doppler principle to calculate the velocity of red blood cells (i.e. the ﬂow of blood). Right parasternal window These images are easiest to obtain with the animal lying on their right side on a cardiac imaging table and by placing the probe on the right-hand side of the chest. However, si�ng, standing, and lying in sternal are also op�ons. The right parasternal window is between the 3rd and 6 th intercostal spaces, between the sternum and costochondral junc�on. Summary: Thoracic radiology and Imaging of the Heart Right parasternal long axis 4 chamber view • Cross sec�oning on the long axis of the heart • Shows the le� and right ventricles, le� and right atria and the atrioventricular valves. • Provides instant feedback on systolic func�on, cardiac size, atrial sizes, valve deformi�es and le� and right pressure or volume overload condi�ons. Right parasternal short axis view • Cross sec�oning on the short axis of the heart • By fanning through the short axis, the ventricular walls and septum, papillary muscles, mitral, aor�c and pulmonary valves, le� atrium and auricle and right ventricular ou�low track. • The most important measurement here is the le� atrium to aor�c ra�o (LA:Ao). This image gives immediate informa�on on the probability of cardiac failure and allow appropriate therapy to start. A line is drawn through the le� atrium and aorta.
