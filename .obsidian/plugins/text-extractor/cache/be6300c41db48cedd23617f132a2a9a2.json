Two projections, usually made orthogonally, are needed to tell the complete story. Conventions for naming the radiograph • Abdomen: • Most studies rely on three projections – Right laterally recumbent, the “right lateral” – Left laterally recumbent, the “left lateral” – Ventrodorsal • Occasionally a fourth projection may be taken – Dorsoventral Right lateral (RLR) Left lateral (LLR) Ventrodorsal (VD) Question ….. • In what way is the stomach different in appearance on the RLR compared to the LLR view? R Conventions for displaying a radiograph • Lateral view: HEAD TO THE LEFT of screen • VD/DV view: HEAD AT THE TOP of screen RIGHT side of patient to the left of the screen R Why? it is difficult to rapidly interpret when up-side-down & back-to-front! A radiographic image is made up of five basic radiographic opacities Gas Fat Fluid and Soft tissue Bone Metal Ear Ring Reading the radiograph • Dark room • Away from distractions……. Principles of Radiographic Interpretation Assess the Roentgen signs – Size – Shape – Margins – Location – Opacity – Number The radiographic report forms part of the legal record. Components of the report: Description Radiographic Diagnosis Differential Diagnoses Recommendations Principles of Radiographic Interpretation Radiographic description There is marked gastric fluid distension, with the stomach extending caudal to the costal arch and over four intercostal spaces. The duodenum and jejunum are also markedly distended with fluid and gas, measuring up to 24mm diameter (normal <12mm in a cat). Distended small intestinal loops are stacking along each other. Radiographic diagnosis and differential diagnoses Diagnosis: Mechanical intestinal obstruction. Differential diagnoses: small intestinal foreign object, neoplasia, intussusception, granulomatous enteritis, stricture, entrapment. Recommendations Exploratory surgery, or abdominal ultrasound to identify the cause of mechanical obstruction and help determine the prognosis. Ultrasound High frequency sound is pulsed into the patient and an echo is received and displayed on the monitor Ultrasound gives a cross- sectional view. The plane is controlled by orientation of the ultrasound transducer.

However, radiographs should not take precedence over a complete history, a thorough physical examination and pertinent laboratory tests” E.A. Riedesel Textbook of Veterinary Diagnostic Radiology 5th ed Thrall DE. Saunders Elsevier 2007 Why do we image the GIT? • In a vomiting dog we need to decide on surgical vs medical treatment • If the GIT is obstructed surgery is indicated, if not- medical management is required. OR Specifically for the GIT: • Location • Size-degree of distension – If distended • How distended? • How much of the GIT is affected? • Opacity: – gas – ingesta (soft tissue) – foreign material Ileus • Assess for radiographic evidence of ileus (lack of peristalsis) – May be due to an obstruction or due to a functional disorder Obstructive or Mechanical ileus • Due to partial or complete obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract • Common causes: – Foreign body such as corn cob, toy, string, stone fruit pits – Mass such as neoplasia – Intussusception Ileus Functional ileus (Paralytic or Adynamic ileus) • Due to decreased or absent peristalsis (no blockage) • Common causes: - electrolyte imbalance - gastroenteritis - pain - sedatives - intestinal hypo-perfusion Ileus Distinguishing between mechanical or functional ileus • mechanical ileus: • focal moderate to marked distension • (may be generalised) • functional ileus: • generalised mild distension • (may be focal) Ileus Ileus - ‘rules and sayings’ for normal small intestine size Dogs 1) Ratio of greatest SI diameter to body of L5 not > 1.6 2) No loop greater than twice the width of others Cats 1) No greater than 12 mm in diameter 2) No greater than twice the height of L4 focal small intestinal distension two ‘populations’ of small intestine distended small intestine is > 2x diameter of non-distended intestine & >1.6xL5 Mechanical ileus stacking of loops ‘hair-pin’ bends distended SI Mechanical ileus stacking of loops ‘hair-pin’ bends distended SI normal SI focal small intestinal distension two ‘populations’ of small intestine distended small intestine is > 2x diameter of non-distended intestine & >1.6xL5 Mechanical ileus stacking of loops ‘hair-pin’ bends focal small intestinal distension two ‘populations’ of small intestine distended small intestine is > 2x diameter of non-distended intestine & >1.6xL5 focal small intestinal distension two ‘populations’ of small intestine distended small intestine is > 2x diameter of non-distended intestine & >1.6xL5 Mechanical ileus stacking of loops ‘hair-pin’ bends Ball Functional ileus normal colon mild generalised small intestinal distension one ‘population’ of small intestine Gastric Dilatation and Volvulus Contrast Studies • Contrast agents are radiopaque or white, and are used to highlight the position, shape, and size of the gastrointestinal tract.
