The left end is activated and the wave of depolarization spreads from left to right, toward the positive electrode. This produces a positive (upright by convention) deflection on the recording paper of the clecuocardiograph. When fully depolarized the deflection retumns to base- line. Repolarization results in the opposite. (From Tilley LP: Essentials of Canine and Feline Electrocardiography, ed 3, Philadelphia, 1992, Lea & Febiger.)
