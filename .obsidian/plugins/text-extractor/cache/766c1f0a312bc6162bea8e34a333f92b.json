The dairy enterprise had a mating start date (MSD) of 22nd August 2020. The cow calved on 1st June 2020 and became pregnant on day one of the mating period (MSD); 22nd August 2020, following artiﬁcial insemination.  Describe what happens to this cow in terms of: • reproduction, • lactation, • management and • husbandry for the next 18 months.  Also list important dates on the farm management calendar.  Make sure you include things like calvings, lactation status and reproductive events. Assume that in 2021 she has a dry period (when she is not lactating) of 50 days and a post- partum anoestrus period (when she doesn’t cycle) of 30 days.  She cycles every 21 days is not in anoestrus and becomes pregnant on the 3rd oestrus that she has following mating start date in 2021.  The cow has an individual cow cell count (ICCC) consistently below 200 for her entire lactation.  The farm MSD remains the same calendar day in 2021, and the AI period is 6 weeks. After the A period natural service using bulls is used. August 2020 22nd August – Cow becomes pregnant Cow is lactating, and sure to calve 1st June 2022 April 2021 12/4/2021 – Cow is dried off 50 days before expected calving date.  She is treated with a teat sealant – DCT not required. 12/4/21 – this is the beginning of the dry period on the farm. She is vaccinated against 5 in 1, and may be treated with an anthelmintic May 2021 11/5/21 – three weeks before she is due to calve she is drafted into a transition mob and fed a transition diet.  She may also receive calf scour vaccinations.  She may be treated with an anthelmintic June 2021 1/6/21 – The cow calves.  The calf is taken away within 12 hours of being born and reared separately.  Her colostrum is harvested and fed to the calf.  The cow’s milk is used for calf feed for the ﬁrst 8 milkings when it cannot be put into the vat.  The cow is in post-partum anoestrus. July 2021 1/7/21 Post-partum anoestrus ends, and the cow has her ﬁrst oestrus period.  MSD hasn’t occurred yet so she is not mated. 22/7/21 The cow has another heat – and is not mated. August 2021 12/8/21 The cow has another heat 22/8/21 MSD for the herd September 2021 2/9/21 The cow is in oestrus and may be submitted to AI but doesn’t conceive 23/9/21 the cow is in oestrus and may be submitted to AI but doesn’t conceive October 2021 3/10/21 – AI period ends on the farm and bulls are run with the herd. 14/10/21 The cows is in oestrus and mated by the bull – she conceives successfully and the cycle starts again! August 2020 22nd August – Cow becomes pregnant Cow is lactating, and sure to calve 1st June 2022 April 2021 12/4/2021 – Cow is dried off 50 days before expected calving date.  She is treated with a teat sealant – DCT not required. 12/4/21 – this is the beginning of the dry period on the farm. She is vaccinated against 5 in 1, and may be treated with an anthelmintic May 2021 11/5/21 – three weeks before she is due to calve she is drafted into a transition mob and fed a transition diet.  She may also receive calf scour vaccinations.  She may be treated with an anthelmintic June 2021 1/6/21 – The cow calves.  The calf is taken away within 12 hours of being born and reared separately.  Her colostrum is harvested and fed to the calf.  The cow’s milk is used for calf feed for the ﬁrst 8 milkings when it cannot be put into the vat.  The cow is in post-partum anoestrus. July 2021 1/7/21 Post-partum anoestrus ends, and the cow has her ﬁrst oestrus period.  MSD hasn’t occurred yet so she is not mated. 22/7/21 The cow has another heat – and is not mated. August 2021 12/8/21 The cow has another heat 22/8/21 MSD for the herd September 2021 2/9/21 The cow is in oestrus and may be submitted to AI but doesn’t conceive 23/9/21 the cow is in oestrus and may be submitted to AI but doesn’t conceive October 2021 3/10/21 – AI period ends on the farm and bulls are run with the herd. 14/10/21 The cows is in oestrus and mated by the bull – she conceives successfully and the cycle starts again! Now consider her heifer calf, born in 2021. Produce a management calendar describing the important events in the calf’s life until it is 2 years old.  Assume the calf becomes pregnant to AI on Mating Start Date, when it is 2 years old.  Describe changes in the calf’s diet, husbandry and reproductive events that occur. June 2021 1/6/2021 Calf is born. Receive colostrum in ﬁrst 24 hours (or might not make it until July 21!). 10% bodyweight in milk, early concentrate feeding (pellets/grain), some roughage. Good calf environment. Ad lib water. If male calf then would be sold after 1 week. Eartag close to birth. July 2021 From 4 weeks of age calf weaned. >0.75kg concentrate per day, group averaging >1kg/ d or more. Disbud. Drench. First vaccination. Move onto high quality pasture and continue concentrate feeding. August 2021 Second vaccination (4-6 weeks post ﬁrst vaccination) September 2021 Potentially 100% pasture diet by this point. Check bodyweight October 2021 November 2021 As pasture quality drops add concentrate back into diet to maintain appropriate growth rate to meet CMW. December 2021 Potentially drench, check FEC. Check bodyweight January 2022 Continue concentrate feeding, based on what quality/quantity pasture is available. February 2022 March 2022 Check bodyweight April 2022 May 2022 June 2022 Check bodyweight. May need another drench, assess by bodyweight gain, FEC. After this date FEC much less useful due to immunity. July 2022 August 2022 Mating start date 22/08/2023. Heifers might be synchronised to allow FTAI. Decide on how many cycles heifers will be joined for and if backup bulls to be used (what breed etc). Bull selection needs to occur few months pre joining ideally.

May 2023 30/05/2023 Calving occurs June 2023 The enterprise decides to keep the best six bull calves according to their dam and sire ASBVs (the mid point prediction). Produce a management calendar describing the important events in the calf’s life until it is sold from the enterprise (list if you consider there may be differences between bulls and why).  Describe changes in the calf’s diet, husbandry and reproductive events that occur. Effectively the overall management of the calf up to weaning will be the same for bulls and heifer calves, although bull calves likely reared as single group if born similar time to make management long term simpler. June 2021 1/6/2021 Calf is born. Receive colostrum in ﬁrst 24 hours (or might not make it until July 21!). 10% bodyweight in milk, early concentrate feeding (pellets/grain), some roughage.
