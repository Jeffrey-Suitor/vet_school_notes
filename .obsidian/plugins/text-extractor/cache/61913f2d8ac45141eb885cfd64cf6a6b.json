KE YW OR D S coagulation cascade, haemophilia, vitamin K, rodenticide, coumarin derivatives, dicoumarol, warfarin, fibrinolysis L E C T UR E OV E RV IE W Disorders of secondary haemostasis involve defects in the generation of fibrin or (rarely) the stability of fibrin formed via the coagulation cascade. Clinical signs suggestive of defective secondary haemostasis include large volume bleeds, haematoma formation, and/or bleeding into body cavities or joints - epistaxis and/or bleeding from other mucous membranes may occur but petechiae, purpura or ecchymoses in skin or mucous membranes are not usually seen - haemorrhage may develop spontaneously or it may be delayed and protracted after a challenge to haemostasis (e.g. trauma, surgery). The mechanisms responsible for defective secondary haemostasis are: • inherited deficiency of one or more coagulation factors • vitamin K antagonism or deficiency • severe acute or chronic hepatic parenchymal disease • excessive fibrinolysis (or fibrinogenolysis). Of these, vitamin K antagonism is the most common mechanism in domestic animals. F U RT HE R R E A DI N G DA Mosier. Vascular disorders and thrombosis.
