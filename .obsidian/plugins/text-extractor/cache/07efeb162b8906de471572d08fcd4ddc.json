What is feeding routine? • How much is she drinking? (inside/outside) • Is she urinating normally? (frequency/volume) • Is she defecating normally? (frequency/consistency, outside?) • How frequent is the vomiting? (also size, consistency, timing) • Does she receive regular worming treatments? • Are there any other behavioural changes? (pacing, vocalising) History & Physical Exam findings • Vaccination and worming not up to date • Diet canned and dry Whiskas • Occasionally allowed outside • Occasionally vomiting largely undigested food soon after eating • Vomiting frequency has increased • Increased volume of faeces, but not diarrhoea • Behavioural changes: pacing, vocalising • Unkempt coat • Underweight • Significantly elevated heart rate • Heart murmur • Elevatedsystolic blood pressure • Masspalpable in ventral neckregion • Unkempt appearance Differential Diagnoses Vascular: cerebral vascular accident causing behavioural change/cognitive dysfunction, cardiac disease Infectious: GI parasites, bacterial/viral cases of maldigestion Neoplastic: intestinal neoplasia (eg lymphoma), nervous system, renal, thyroid Drugs: not consistent with history Inflammatory/Idiopathic: inflammatory bowel disease, chronic renal disease, hepatic disease Congenital: not consistent with history Autoimmune/Anatomical: GI obstruction, autoimmune disease of kidneys/liver Trauma/Toxins: toxins affecting the GI system, renal toxins Endocrine: diabetes mellitus, hyperthyroidism, hyperadrenocorticism Further tests? • Blood tests: glucose (diabetes), hepatic & renal parameters • Blood test: thyroid hormone (hyperthyroidism) • Urinalysis: USG (renal), glucose (diabetes) • Faecal exam: egg count (parasites) • Abdominal ultrasound (GI disease, hepatic/renal disease) • Imaging of neck mass – ultrasound, scintigraphy (thyroid neoplasia) • Echocardiogram (cardiac disease) Test results – significant findings • Haematology: – results all normal – no evidence of anaemia or inflammation • Biochemistry: – Blood glucose normal (not diabetesmellitus) – Urea/creatinine normal (no evidence of renal impairment) – Mild elevation of ALT(leakage of liver cells) – Significant elevation of T4(thyroxine) • Urinalysis: – No evidence of impairment of renal function/renal disease Differential Diagnoses Vascular: cerebral vascular accident causing behavioural change/cognitive dysfunction, cardiac disease Infectious: GI parasites, bacterial/viral cases of maldigestion Neoplastic: intestinal neoplasia (eg lymphoma), nervous system, renal, thyroid Drugs: not consistent with history Inflammatory/Idiopathic: inflammatory bowel disease, chronic renal disease, hepatic disease Congenital: not consistent with history Autoimmune/Anatomical: GI obstruction, autoimmune disease of kidneys/liver Trauma/Toxins: toxins affecting the GI system, renal toxins Endocrine: diabetes mellitus, hyperthyroidism, hyperadrenocorticism Effects of increased levelsof thyroid hormones • Consumption of stored body fuels: glycogen, fats and proteins = weight loss, increased appetite • Increased heart rate and force of contraction – can lead to heart disease = heart murmur • Increased blood pressure • Increased rate and depth of respiration • Increased gastrointestinal motility andsecretion = weight loss, increased appetite • Excitatory effects on the central nervous system = pacing, vocalising, unkempt coat • Increased muscle activity • Increased secretion and utilisation of other hormones Regulation of thyroid hormone production Image from Lecturio.com • Thyroglobulin stored in thyroid follicles is the precursor to thyroid hormones • Iodine is required for the synthesis of T4 and T3 from thyroglobulin • T4 and T3(small amount) released into circulation • fT4 is de-iodinated to T3 in the tissues TSH = thyroid stimulating hormone, produced by anterior pituitary gland TRH = thyrotropin releasing hormone Hyperthyroidism in cats Image from Lecturio.com – Approximately 98%of cases:Thyroid nodular hyperplasia/adenoma (benign) – Autonomoussecretion of T4and T3 → not controlled byTSH – Low TSH levels, normal thyroid follicular tissue atrophies – Remainder are thyroid adenocarcinomas (malignant) TSH = thyroid stimulating hormone, produced by anterior pituitary gland TRH = thyrotropin releasing hormone Thyroid scintigraphy: nuclear scansusing Technetium99radioisotope http://animalendocrine.blogspot.com.au/2010/07/is-thyroid-scanning-useful-in-cats-with.html Goitre in lambs Image from Lecturio.com • Inadequate iodine intake or ingestion of ‘goitrogens’ • Very low production of thyroid hormones • Increased TSH levels → hypertrophy of thyroid gland Treatment options for hyperthyroidism • Surgery: thyroidectomy. Drawback – risk of damage/removal of parathyroid, thyroid issue located elsewhere • Medical: carbimazole/methimazole – block synthesis of thyroid hormones. Drawback – lifelong administration and monitoring, owner (and cat) compliance an issue • Radioactive iodine – irradiates hyperplastic thyroid cells. Drawback – cost, permanent (care with renal function) • Low iodine diet: Hills y/d. Drawback – palatability, multi-cat households Effect on renal function • Increased thyroid hormone = increased renal blood flow = increased GFR • Cats treated for hyperthyroidism with underlying renal failure may experience a deterioration in renal function • Trial treatment with medication enables monitoring for this ‘unmasking’ of renal disease before permanent treatments like radioactive iodine or surgery. • Monitor: blood urea/creatinine, USG and urine protein Hypothyroidism • Some cats develop a temporary hypothyroidism following radioactive iodine treatment • Rarely, radioactive iodine can cause permanent hypothyroidism • Classically causes weight gain and lethargy","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
