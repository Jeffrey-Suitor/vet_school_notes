Liver • Positioned between: – The diaphragm cranially – The stomach and intestinal mass caudally • Bulk lies to the right in all species • Held in position by – Close attachment to the diaphragm – Pressure of the viscera External features • Size and weight varies – Carnivores – 3-5% body weight – Omnivores – 2-3% body weight – Herbivores – 1-1.5% body weight • Reddish brown in colour but friable • Highly vascular • Covered by serosa and tunica fibrosa External features • Two surfaces – Cranial (parietal) or diaphragmatic • Convex • Faces to the left and right sides and dorsally – Caudal or visceral surface • Concave • Faces mainly caudoventrally and to the left • Contains the portal area External features • Two borders – Dorsal border • Mid line - groove for caudal vena cava • To the left of this - notch for the oesophagus – Ventral border • Sharp edged • Notch for the round ligament (ligamentum teres) External features - DOG • Liver is divided into lobes – – Left lateral – Left medial – Quadrate – Right medial – Right lateral – Caudate (caudate and papillary processes) Ligaments of the liver • From the cranial surface of the liver to the diaphragm – Coronary – Falciform – Right and left triangular • Hepatorenal • Round ligament of liver (ligamentum teres) • Lesser omentum Gall Bladder • Pear shaped • Partly fused to liver • Lies between the quadrate and right medial lobes • Diverticulum of bile duct • Bile flow - two way in cystic duct • No gall bladder in the Horse Bile Duct System • Microscopic canaliculi • Larger ductules – few large hepatic ducts • Common hepatic duct – leaves portal area • Cystic duct – side branch • Bile duct or common bile duct • Major duodenal papilla Blood supply to the liver • Hepatic artery – branch of celiac – most of the O2 • Portal vein – 70-80% of total blood supply • All blood is collected by a single set of veins - – Central veins of lobules – Progressively larger hepatic veins – Drain to caudal vena cava Nerve supply: • Sympathetic • Parasympathetic Formation of the Liver in the embryo • Diverticulum from ventral surface of fore-gut at junction of Stomach/duodenum • Initially grows into the mesoderm of the septum transversum Formation of the Liver in the embryo • Hepatocytes and bile duct system are endoderm derived Comparative aspects - Dog • Liver – Relatively large – Almost entirely within costal area – R:L proportion ~ 3:2 – Deeply divided into 5/6 lobes Dog - liver left lateral left medial quadrate dorsal left right right lateral right medial caudate process papillary process gall bladder portal vein caudal vena cava round lig Comparative aspects - Dog • Gall bladder – Sunk deep between quadrate/R. medial lobes – To R of median plane – Appears at visceral surface – Common bile duct opens - • On major duodenal papilla 5-8cm distal to pylorus • In conjunction with the pancreatic duct Comparative aspects - Horse • Liver – Smaller proportion – Long axis is oblique – 2/3 lies to right of median plane – Dorsal border - left part does not extend as far dorsally as the right Comparative aspects - Horse • Liver - lobes – Left – Quadrate – Right – Caudate • Hepatorenal ligament - attaches liver to base of caecum as well as right kidney Comparative aspects - horse • Bile Duct System – NO GALL BLADDER – Bile duct opens • 13-15 cm distal to the pylorus • On the major duodenal papilla – Hepatopancreatic ampulla • In conjunction with the pancreatic duct Dog Pig Horse Ox Comparative aspects - cow • Liver – Contact with right abdominal wall 7th – last rib – Largely covered by lung – May be palpated in cranial R. paralumbar fossa – Lies almost entirely to R. of midline • Rotated 90o in embryo – Right lobe - dorsal – Left lobe - ventral left right Comparative aspects - Cow • Gall bladder – Piriform shape – Projects beyond lateral margin of the right lobe • Bile Duct opens - – In 2nd bend of the sigmoid flexure – About 60cm form the pylorus – Alone on the major duodenal papilla Comparative aspects - Pig • Liver – Resembles dog in position and lobation – Has 4 major lobes + short quadrate + caudate • No papillary process – High content of interlobular c.t. - speckled appearance to liver surface (‘Morocco leather’) • Bile Duct opens – Alone 2.5-5cm from the pylorus PigComparative aspects - Avian • Liver – Dark brown in adult – Lobes of liver embrace caudal portion of heart • Bile ducts – Two bile ducts - one from each lobe – Enter distal end of duodenum – Close to pancreatic ducts Clinical case • 20 year old gelding • Weight loss • Jaundice • Blood enzymes indicate liver damage • Where do you biopsy the liver in a standing horse?
