Benign tumours may be encapsulated Capsule surrounding tumour composed of fibrous connective tissue Malignant neoplasia displays infiltrative growth Malignant cells are invading into the underlying tissue Surface Malignant neoplasia may metastasise  Metastasis = Growth of neoplastic cells distant from the primary tumour  Spread of neoplasm to other locations NOT through direct invasion Neoplastic cells within a vein Malignant neoplasia may metastasise  Metastasis = Growth of neoplastic cells distant from the primary tumour  Spread of neoplasm to other locations NOT through direct invasion Haematogenous ◼ Most commonly lung or liver Malignant neoplasia may metastasise  Metastasis = Growth of neoplastic cells distant from the primary tumour  Spread of neoplasm to other locations NOT through direct invasion Haematogenous ◼ Most commonly lung or liver Primary tumour Metastases Malignant neoplasia may metastasise  Metastasis = Growth of neoplastic cells distant from the primary tumour  Spread of neoplasm to other locations NOT through direct invasion Haematogenous ✓ Most commonly lung or liver Lymphatic ✓ Initially spread to draining lymph node ✓ Progressive central spread along lymphatic vessels ✓ May enter systemic circulation through thoracic duct Malignant neoplasia may metastasise  Metastasis = Growth of neoplastic cells distant from the primary tumour  Spread of neoplasm to other locations NOT through direct invasion Haematogenous ✓ Most commonly lung or liver Lymphatic ✓ Initially spread to draining lymph node ✓ Progressive central spread along lymphatic vessels ✓ May enter systemic circulation through thoracic duct Metastasis of oral neoplasm to submandibular lymphnode Malignant neoplasia may metastasise  Metastasis = Growth of neoplastic cells distant from the primary tumour  Spread of neoplasm to other locations NOT through direct invasion Haematogenous ✓ Most commonly lung or liver Lymphatic ✓ Initially spread to draining lymph node ✓ Progressive central spread along lymphatic vessels ✓ May enter systemic circulation through thoracic duct Implantation ✓ Spread through body cavities ✓ Sometimes called carcinomatosis Clusters of neoplastic cells implanted on serosa Malignant cells are (often) poorly differentiated  Poor cellular differentiation is termed anaplasia  Features of anaplasia include: 1. Cells have variable morphology (pleomorphism) ✓ Variable cell size (anisocytosis), especially enlargement (macrocytosis) ✓ Variable nuclear size (anisokaryosis), especially enlargement (macrokaryosis) ✓ Variable nucleolus size (anisonucleosis), especially enlargement (macronucleosis) 2. Cells may have increased nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio 3. Nuclei may be dark staining (hyperchromatic) 4. Abnormal mitoses may be present ✓ Stellate, tripolar, or disorganised chromatin patterns 5. Multinucleate cells (giant cells) may be present 6. Cells lose normal orientation (eg. no basal orientation of nuclei in intestinal epithelial cells) and there is architectural disorganization (failure to form normal structures) Anaplasia – pleomorphism Anisokaryosis Abnormal mitoses Hyperchromatic (dark) nuclei Anaplasia – pleomorphism Anisocytosis Anisokaryosis Variable shape Multinucleate cell Anaplasia – abnormal mitoses Normal mitoses Anaplasia – abnormal mitoses Normal mitoses Abnormal mitoses Anaplasia - Cellular and architectural organisation Normal smooth muscle Leiomyoma –well-differentiated Anaplasia - Cellular and architectural organisation Normal smooth muscle Leiomyosarcoma - anaplastic Malignant tumours (usually) grow rapidly  Fast-growing = high mitotic rate (number of mitoses per microscope field) Classifying neoplasms by cell type 1. Epithelial (endoderm or ectoderm origin) ✓ Glandular tissue and tissues communicating with the “outside world” ✓ Glandular (eg. sweat glands, pancreas, thyroid) ✓ Non-glandular (eg. skin, respiratory or gastrointestinal lining) 2. Mesenchymal/connective tissue (mesoderm origin) ✓ Sometimes referred to as spindle cells ✓ Intermediate tissues not connected to the “outside” – generally structural ✓ Connective tissue, muscle, bone, cartilage, blood vessels, fat 3. Round cell ✓ Defined by lack of cohesion between cells ✓ Mostly leukocytes or related cells ✓ Lymphocytes/plasma cells, macrophages (histiocytes), melanocytes ✓ Most are technically mesenchymal (melanocyte is an exception), but usually considered as a separate group Round cell tumours lymphoma melanoma histiocytoma UQ UQ mastocytoma UQ UQ TVT Question Time!  What type of cell is the myocardial cell (heart muscle)?

Local effects Distortion and compression (benign) or infiltration (malignant) of surrounding tissues Impairment of normal movement Ulceration, infection 2. Systemic effects Excessive secretion of normal hormones 3. Paraneoplastic syndromes Disease unrelated to the local mass effect and normal function of the cells ✓ Pyrexia ✓ Cancer cachexia ✓ Secretion of abnormal hormones ✓ Autoimmune disease Local effects - compression/invasion  Effect depends on organ  Examples Spinal cord ✓ Paralysis Local effects - compression/invasion  Effect depends on organ  Examples Spinal cord ✓ Paralysis Brain ✓ Seizures ✓ Abnormal mentation ✓ Coma Local effects - compression/invasion  Effect depends on organ  Examples Spinal cord ✓ Paralysis Brain ✓ Seizures ✓ Abnormal mentation ✓ Coma Skull -Seizures ✓ -Abnormal mentation ✓ -Coma Local effects - compression/invasion  Effect depends on organ  Examples Spinal cord ✓ Paralysis Brain ✓ Seizures ✓ Abnormal mentation ✓ Coma Liver/bile duct ✓ Biliary obstruction and jaundice Local effects - compression/invasion  Effect depends on organ  Examples Spinal cord ✓ Paralysis Brain ✓ Seizures ✓ Abnormal mentation ✓ Coma Liver/bile duct ✓ Biliary obstruction and jaundice GI tract ✓ Intestinal obstruction Local effects - compression/invasion  Effect depends on organ  Examples Spinal cord ✓ Paralysis Brain ✓ Seizures ✓ Abnormal mentation ✓ Coma Liver/bile duct ✓ Biliary obstruction and jaundice GI tract ✓ Intestinal obstruction Obstruction of blood vessels/lymphatics Local effects – Impairment of normal movement Pedunculated lipoma UQ Strangulating lipoma Usually found in older overweight horses. Lipomas that are pedunculated can entangle sections of small intestine, leading to strangulation and vascular compromise. Local effects - Ulceration/infection Perforated gastric carcinoma Ulceration and infection Systemic effects  Excessive hormone secretion Normal cellular function, but unregulated and excessive Example – Gigantism ✓ Excessive growth hormone secretion by neoplastic pituitary cells -Continued growth throughout life and extreme height Other examples include: ✓ Hyperthyroidism caused by thyroid tumours ✓ Hypoglycemia caused by insulin- secreting tumours of pancreas (insulinomas) Paraneoplastic syndromes – pyrexia  Due to secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines Interleukin 1 (IL-1) Interleukin 6 (IL-6) Tumour necrosis factor(TNF)  Neoplasia is a common cause of “fever of unknownorigin” Paraneoplastic syndromes – cancer cachexia  Cachexia = Weight loss regardless of caloric intake  Caused by releaseof: Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF) ✓ Appetite suppression ✓ Increases protein catabolism ✓ Stimulates lipolysis Catabolic factors produced by tumours (eg. proteolysis-inducing factor) Paraneoplastic syndromes – hormone secretion  Secretion of abnormal hormones Excessive thyroid hormone secretion by a thyroid tumour (for example) is NOT paraneoplastic disease  Pseudohyperparathyroidism AKA hypercalcaemia of malignancy Mainly associated with lymphoma and anal gland adenocarcinoma Neoplastic cells produce parathyroid hormone related peptide (PTHrP) PTHrP mimics the effect of parathyroid hormone (PTH), causing bone resorption which leads to hypercalcaemia PTHrP PTH Bone resorption Increased serum calcium Paraneoplastic syndrome - Autoimmune disease  Immune response induced by abnormal antigen expression on tumours Immune response cross-reacts with antigens normally present in the body Examples 1. Immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia ✓ Caused by antibodies to neoplastic antigens cross- reacting and binding to RBCs ✓ Lysis of red blood cells and anaemia 2. Myaesthenia gravis ✓ Caused by antibodies to neoplastic antigens cross- reacting and blocking receptors for nerve signals ✓ Muscle weakness and collapse Other paraneoplastic syndromes  Hypertrophic osteopathy (Marie’s disease) Periosteal bone production affecting the bones of the limbs Effect of mass development in the chest (not always neoplastic and sometimes also abdominal), but pathogenesis unclear ◼ Vagal nerve stimulation?
