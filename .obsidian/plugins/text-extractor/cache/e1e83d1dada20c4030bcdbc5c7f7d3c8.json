May 2020 It is available in PDF format from the ACMF website www.chicken.org.au. Any comments should be addressed to ACMF, P.O. Box 579, North Sydney NSW 2059 or sent to acmf@chicken.org.au. Page 1 of 46 A generic National Farm Biosecurity Manual for Poultry Production was produced by a Biosecurity Consultative Group, established as a resolution of the 2007 Government–Industry Avian Influenza (AI) Forum. Membership of the group included representatives from each of the following organisations and poultry industry sectors: • Commonwealth Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry • Animal Health Australia • Australian Chicken Meat Federation Inc. • Australian Chicken Growers’ Council • Australian Egg Corporation Limited • Australasian Turkey Federation • Free Range Egg and Poultry Australia • Australian Duck Meat Association • Emu Industry Federation of Australia • Australian Ostrich Association • Game bird industry • NSW Department of Primary Industries • Queensland Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries The purpose of the National Farm Biosecurity Manual for Poultry Production was to establish a minimum set of biosecurity standards for all poultry (including ratites). The February 2010 National Farm Biosecurity Manual for Chicken Growers was based on the generic Poultry Production Manual, adapted to reflect the requirements as they applied specifically to the commercial chicken meat industry. This current (2019) version of the National Farm Biosecurity Manual for Chicken Growers was produced after a review process to ensure its currency and relevance. While no outbreaks of emergency disease have occurred in the Australian chicken meat industry since release of the 2010 Manual, new information, changes in the industry, outbreaks of AI internationally and in other sectors of the poultry industry in Australia, and a global focus on antimicrobial resistance make such a review timely. Individual producers and companies may wish to develop enhanced biosecurity manuals, which should nevertheless incorporate these minimum standards, in addition to any specific company requirements. BACKGROUND Page 2 of 46 SCOPE The Manual applies to commercial meat chicken farms (broiler farms) from the time of delivery of one day-old meat chickens, until pick-up for slaughter and includes disposal of dead chickens. The purpose of the Manual is to establish a minimum set of biosecurity standards, applicable to all meat chicken production from hatcheries to the point of delivery at the processor. Biosecurity measures on meat chicken breeder farms are expected to be much more stringent than those outlined in this manual, reflecting the economic importance and the extended life cycle of breeder flocks. IMPLEMENTATION The Primary Production and Processing (PPP) standard for Poultry Meat (Standard 4.2.2) formally commenced in 2012. While the biosecurity requirements in this Manual are in some areas broader than what is strictly required from a food safety point of view, it is expected that adoption of the measures stipulated in this Manual will largely meet the PPP requirements as far as the production phase is concerned, and includes consideration of the prevention of transmission of antimicrobial resistant bacteria from wild birds and animals to chicken flocks, and reverse zoonosis (transfer of bacteria from humans to animals).

Biosecurity and quarantine are integral parts of any successful poultry production system. Biosecurity refers to those measures taken to prevent or control the introduction and spread of infectious agents to a flock. Such infectious agents, whether they cause clinical or subclinical disease, are emergency diseases (like AI and NDV), endemic diseases (like ILTV), are zoonotic pathogens (like Campylobacter and Salmonella) or are antimicrobial resistant bacteria, significantly reduce the productivity, profitability and long term financial viability of a poultry operation. The level of biosecurity must always be optimal because infection occurs before clinical signs are observed in a flock and thus there will be a period of potential “silent” spread prior to any industry awareness or notification of infection. Biosecurity is about managing risk to meet the objectives stated above. It is essential that a risk assessment be conducted for each enterprise to establish what level of risk exists in each phase of its operations and to identify and implement control measures appropriate to these levels of risk. This manual identifies areas of risk common to most meat chicken farms and measures considered appropriate to minimise these risks. When undertaking the risk assessment underpinning the farm-specific biosecurity measures, it is important to take into account all factors that may impact on the biosecurity of the production area. These factors should include location and layout of property and biosecure production area, source of water supply, disease status of the district, proximity to other production areas with avian species, presence and type of wildlife, and interface with the organisations and/or individual clients that are being supplied. These interactions include pick-ups, service personnel, other industry personnel, contractors, removal of litter and deliveries of day-old chicks and feed. An additional element to lessen the severity of disease and pathogen shedding, which could reduce the risk of transmission and spread of disease, is the use of vaccination. The Manual does not cover this specifically, but the importance of an appropriate vaccination strategy is acknowledged and vaccination as a possible risk management measure should form part of the overall biosecurity assessment and strategy. An example biosecurity self-audit/auditable checklist for continuous improvement is attached as Appendix 1. This document may also form the basis for either 2nd or 3rd party audits where this is required. Biosecurity is like any other insurance policy and as such it is a prudent investment. MEAT CHICKEN PRODUCTION BIOSECURITY Page 7 of 46 MAJOR ROUTES FOR DISEASE AND PATHOGEN TRANSMISSION There are several potential routes for disease and pathogen transmission. The below outlines what are considered to be the main risks. POULTRY • Movement of chickens • Dead chicken disposal OTHER ANIMALS • Wild birds • Feral and domestic animals, including other livestock and pets • Insects • Rodents (rats / mice) • Domestic birds PEOPLE • Farm personnel and family members living on site • Contractors, maintenance personnel, neighbours, servicepersons, visitors • Pathogens can be transmitted, for example, on hands, boots, clothing, hair or in nasal passages • People who have recently recovered from, or still suffering from, gastrointestinal disease or an infectious respiratory disease may transfer human pathogens, including antimicrobial resistant bacteria, directly to the chickens EQUIPMENT • Equipment and vehicles that have entered the biosecure production area without decontamination AIR • Transmission of pathogens as an aerosol or dust WATER SUPPLY • Water supplies may become contaminated with faeces from contact with avian or other animal species • Access to dams and other contaminated surface water in close proximity to the production area; Transmission of pathogens may be via contact with the chickens either directly (i.e. on a range for free range production) or indirectly (i.e. drinking water, cooling systems, range irrigation water or shed washing water) FEED • Feed may be contaminated by the raw materials used, post-production and during transport, or by exposure to rodents and birds on the property; Bacteria and mould in poor quality or damaged feed may also be a concern LITTER • Transport of litter material on and off the farm site • On site storage of used litter or fresh litter used for litter maintenance during production Page 8 of 46 THE CONCEPT OF A ‘BIOSECURE PRODUCTION AREA’ AND ‘PROPERTY’ In this document, the ‘biosecure production area’ includes the poultry sheds, the ranges used for free range production, the areas used for feed storage and handling, any dedicated staff amenities, delivery access routes and the area surrounding the sheds, including pick-up areas. The property is the land on which the production area is located and typically includes the facility manager’s home and may include other farm land used for livestock or cultivation. Sections of the production area boundary may also be the property boundary. Any reference to sheds is a reference to roofed buildings capable of and used for holding poultry securely within its perimeter. Any reference to range is a reference to fenced outdoor area that are, or at times are, accessed by the chickens being farmed. EARLY ACTION PLAN Each grower must have clear, documented guidelines regarding the circumstances when an emergency animal disease alert should be raised. Refer to Section 7 for more information on what an ‘Early Action Plan’ should include. EMERGENCY ANIMAL DISEASE OUTBREAK PROCEDURES In the event of an outbreak of an emergency disease, heightened biosecurity procedures will be implemented. They may also be implemented for a serious outbreak of an endemic disease. THE TERM “POULTRY” The term “Poultry” in the remainder of this document refers to meat chickens. For other poultry species, please refer to the generic poultry farm biosecurity manual “National Farm Biosecurity Manual, Poultry Production” (Department of Agriculture and Water Resources) or the sector specific manual relevant to the particular species concerned. Page 9 of 46 ROUTINE BIOSECURITY PROCEDURES 1. DOCUMENTATION AND TRAINING OBJECTIVE To ensure awareness by and training of all production area employees in all relevant biosecurity requirements. OBJECTIVE To limit and control access to poultry production areas by people and prevent as much as possible access by other livestock, wild birds and other animals (including rodents). 1.1. Each production facility must keep a copy of this National Farm Biosecurity Manual for Chicken Growers (the Manual) readily accessible to staff. 1.2. Staff must be provided with training in the relevant parts of the Manual and such training is to be recorded. 2. FACILITY STANDARDS 2.1. The biosecure production area must have a perimeter fence or otherwise well-defined boundary (e.g. creek, vegetation) establishing a clearly defined biosecurity zone. Sections of the production area boundary may also be the property boundary. A map that identifies the biosecure production area for a farm must be kept on site. An example is provided in Appendix 2. 2.2. If livestock graze the property then the production area must have a stock proof fence. It is not recommended that grazing livestock be permitted inside the biosecure production area. Transmission of contaminants from grazing livestock to poultry must be avoided. Drainage from livestock pastures or holding areas must not enter poultry enclosures or areas that can be accessed by poultry (e.g. through fences). 2.3. A sketch or map of the layout of the property, showing the biosecure area, production area, sheds, ranges, access roads and gates must be created and maintained up-to-date and kept on site. 2.4. All vehicle entrances to the production area must be capable of being closed off to vehicle traffic and locked (e.g. lockable gate which should be kept locked at all times) and must display signage that includes “Biosecure Area No Entry Unless Authorised” or similar wording, and adheres to state Government requirements. In addition, signage must direct visitors to contact the Manager before proceeding i.e. telephone number and/or enquire at house. 2.5. There should be a parking area outside the biosecure production area for vehicles not required ROUTINE BIOSECURITY PROCEDURES These procedures should be implemented and followed on a daily basis. They give a high degree of assurance that diseases and pathogens will not be carried into poultry biosecure production areas and will reduce the risk of transmission between production areas. These should be seen as a minimum requirement. Page 10 of 46 to enter the biosecure production area. There must be a change area away from sheds for visitors to change into clean protective clothing and boots or coveralls and boot covers. Facilities to sanitise and/ or wash hands must be available. 2.6. Entry to sheds must only be made through entrances where a footbath exists containing a suitable disinfectant used in accordance with company and manufacturer’s instructions and changed on a regular basis. There must be provision for scraping the soles of boots before dipping to ensure the sanitiser is making contact with the soles of the boots. A preferable system is the use of separate production area and shed footwear. Entry to sheds must only be made through entrances where hand sanitation facilities exist. 2.7. Sheds should only be able to be entered through dedicated entrance points. 2.8. Shed entries, including the pick-up entrance, should be constructed of a hard surface that is capable of being cleaned and disinfected 2.9. Adequate and biosecure dead chicken disposal procedures must be in place (e.g. collection as per Appendix 3, composting as per Appendix 4 or incineration with after-burner) and conform with applicable environmental compliance requirements. 2.10. All poultry housing must be designed and maintained to prevent the entry of wild birds and other animals and limit the access of vermin as far as is practical. 2.11. Landscape – Trees and shrubs that don’t encourage wild bird visitation or habitation should be selected for within the biosecure production area. The area around sheds must be kept free from debris and vegetation should be mown regularly to discourage wild birds, insects and rodents which are potential disease vectors. Vegetation buffers planted for dust and odour control should not be compromised, although biosecurity risks should be taken into consideration when planning and designing vegetation buffers. 2.12. Drainage – The production area should be adequately drained to prevent accumulation and stagnation of water likely to attract wild birds, especially in the areas around sheds. Standing water may also increase the presence of insects which can act as significant disease vectors. 2.13. An appropriate vermin control strategy and plan must be developed and implemented, which may include provisions for managing rodents, foxes, and wild dogs and cats. 2.14. A baiting program for rodents must be implemented that reflects the assessed risk level using rodenticides that are approved for use in the production area. Such a baiting program must include the following features: 2.14.1. Bait stations must be numbered, and a map kept of their location. 2.14.2. Bait stations must be placed at regular intervals around the sheds based on the risk assessment, and not in locations potentially accessible by the chickens. The number of bait stations should be increased in areas where there are signs of increased rodent activity. Page 11 of 46 2.14.3. Bait stations must be checked frequently using a risk-based approach and fresh baits laid as required. 2.14.4. A record should be kept of each inspection and activity noted (see Appendix 5). 2.14.5. Bait stations must be designed to minimise the opportunity for other mammals and birds to access the bait. 2.15. Drinking water for poultry, as well as cooling water used in poultry sheds, regardless of water source, must meet appropriate water standards (tested at input to manage risks being introduced). Surface water treatment guidelines are in Appendix 6 and water quality guidelines are in Appendix 7. Refer to the National Water Biosecurity Manual for more information. All surface water and water from other sources that does not meet the standard (at input) must be treated (e.g. by chlorination, ultraviolet, iodine) and monitored to ensure that the standard is met (Appendix 8 provides an example record sheet). Treated water supply must be kept in a closed system from the point of treatment to the drinker. Water for shed cleaning should be sanitised, preferably to the water quality guidelines in Appendix 7, to reduce the risk of contaminating the shed environment prior to the placement of chicks. Water quality should be tested at output to monitor waterline cleanliness. 2.16. When designing new farms ensure that dams or other water bodies are outside the biosecure production area and as far as possible away from the sheds. If dams are inside the biosecure production area, then they should be managed to minimise the biosecurity risk posed by wild birds and animals accessing the dam or flooding of the dam water into areas where the chickens may come into contact with it. 2.17. Dogs and cats must not enter sheds unless dogs are part of the flock security strategy. 2.18. Only commercially produced meat chickens are to be kept on the property and no other avian species (including aviary birds, waterfowl and pet birds) or pigs are to be kept on the property, unless the property can be divided off into completely separate functional production units. e.g. separate biosecure areas, equipment, staff etc. 2.19. Feeding systems into the shed must be closed to ensure that feed in silos and feed delivery systems are protected from access and contamination by wild birds and rodents. Feed spills should be cleaned up without delay to prevent the congregation of wild birds and attraction of rodents. 2.20. Where chicken weighing is practiced, it must be carried out using the production area’s own weighing frames and scales. Company service personnel can use their own scales provided they are cleaned and disinfected when moved between production areas. 2.21. It should be standard practice to cull any chicken that escapes the housing. Page 12 of 46 OBJECTIVE To minimise the risk of introducing or spreading a disease, pathogen or contaminant through people movement, including: • Staff (including production personnel and company service personnel) • Contractors, suppliers and other service personnel • Visitors and family members and to document such movements to facilitate tracing in case of a concern. 3. PERSONNEL STANDARDS AND PROCEDURES allowed in the biosecure production area until fully recovered. 3.1.3. Staff must declare any overseas travel, including whether contact with avian species or pigs was made while travelling and any personnel including the grower and family must comply with required company quarantine periods prior to entering the biosecure production area. 3.1.4. Production area personnel must wear laundered clean clothes and shoes/boots each day at the commencement of their work. Personnel must ensure that they do not become contaminated by contact with avian species or pigs on their way to work, or if they leave and return to the property during the work day. 3.1.5. Production staff must have dedicated footwear for the meat chicken biosecure production area. It is critical that boots worn in sheds are not worn or taken outside the biosecure production area. They are the most likely method for disease spread by personnel. 3.1. Production Personnel 3.1.1. Production area personnel or any person residing on the property must not have contact with any other poultry, birds (including domestic pet birds) or pigs and sign a quarantine declaration (example in Appendix 9). A minimum quarantine period between contact is considered to be 24 hours, however a suitable quarantine period should be instituted between contact with other avian species and commercial meat chickens, which may vary depending on the risk (e.g. if the other avian species were known to be carrying an infectious pathogen). 3.1.2. Personnel who have recently recovered from, or still suffering from gastrointestinal disease or confirmed to be suffering from an infectious respiratory disease should not be Page 13 of 46 3.2. Contractors, Suppliers, Service Personnel and Other Visitors Chicken growers must be aware of the specific biosecurity requirements of contractors, service personnel, pick-up crews and delivery contractors etc which are outlined in more detail in section 6. The requirements listed here are the responsibility of the chicken grower to facilitate and ensure they are adhered to and to report to the processor if contractors engaged by them are not adhering to required biosecurity measures. 3.2.1. All contractors, suppliers, service personnel and other visitors must agree to comply with the entry conditions as stipulated in Appendix 10A (which must be displayed prominently near the Visitors’ Log). All visits must be approved by the Manager before visitors may enter sheds and ranges. This requirement also applies to vaccination crews. 3.2.2. Visitors’ Log – A record must be kept of all visitors to the biosecure production area including contractors and company personnel (see Appendix 10B regarding details to be recorded and an example format). All visitors entering sheds or ranges must complete and sign the Visitors’ Log. The only exceptions are detailed below in 3.2.3. 3.2.3. Exceptions – The only people who may enter the sheds and poultry ranges without signing the Visitors’ Log are personnel covered by the Personnel Quarantine Declaration (Appendix 9) such as farm personnel and members of pick-up crews. It is recommended that the pick-up foreman sign the Visitors’ Log for the entire crew. 3.2.4. Contractors, suppliers, service personnel and other visitors must declare if they have been overseas in the 5 days prior to visiting the farm and follow the required company risk management which may include entry not being permitted. If contact with any poultry, pigs or other avian species was made while overseas in the 5 days prior to the visit then entry is not permitted. 3.2.5. Any authorised visitor, including neighbours, friends, other producers, contractors, service personnel and suppliers likely to have been exposed that day to poultry, other birds or pigs are not permitted entry to the biosecure production area unless additional company- specific risk management requirements are implemented and documented. 3.2.6. Contractors, service personnel, suppliers and other visitors must park their vehicles outside the biosecure production area unless it is essential that the vehicle be taken on site e.g. maintenance contractors. Visitors entering sheds or ranges must complete and sign the Visitors’ Log (see Appendix 10B). 3.2.7. Other deliveries (e.g. gas and feed drivers) – Drivers must confine their movements to the immediate vicinity of the truck and trailer and must not enter sheds. Whether drivers sign the Visitor’s log is at the discretion of the company, but the company that operates the Page 14 of 46 trucks must have appropriate traceability records. 3.2.8. Contractors, service personnel, suppliers and other visitors who have recently recovered from, or still suffering from gastrointestinal disease or confirmed to be suffering from an infectious respiratory disease should not be allowed in the biosecure production area until fully recovered. 3.2.9. Anyone visiting a biosecure production area must wear clean laundered clothes and clean boots/shoes and/or boot covers, clean (or new disposable) protective coveralls (including a change of coveralls and boot covers if moving from older to younger or from sick to healthy flocks). Coveralls (either clean or new disposable) should be made available on site or brought with the visitor (coverall requirements specified by the farm manager or company) and disposed of on site at the completion of the visit. 3.2.10. Movements should always be made from younger to older, or from healthy to sick flocks. 3.3. Entry Procedures for Chicken Sheds OBJECTIVE To reduce the risk of introducing disease agents and contaminants into poultry sheds and enclosures and reduce the attraction of rodents and wild birds to production areas. OBJECTIVE To assist early detection of animal health issues and the response to any biosecurity breach. 3.3.1. Soles of boots must be scraped before dipping in the footbath to ensure the sanitiser is making contact with the soles of the boots. A preferable system is the use of separate production area and shed footwear. 3.3.2. Entry to sheds must only be made through entrances where hand washing and/or sanitation and footbath facilities exist, which must be used before entering. 3.3.3. Facilities should be available for the cleaning and disinfection of equipment before entry. 4. OPERATIONAL STANDARDS 4.1. Cleaning and Ground Maintenance 4.1.1. Feed spills must be cleaned up as soon as practicable. Feed attracts wild birds and rodents into the biosecure production area. 4.1.2. Grass on and around the biosecure production area must be kept cut – long grass attracts rodents and favours the survival of viruses and bacteria and encourages the presence of wild birds. Page 15 of 46 4.1.3. Footbaths must be inspected daily (e.g. for excessive organic matter) and the contents replaced as required to achieve an adequate depth and concentration of suitable disinfectant used according to company and manufacturer’s recommendations. 4.1.4. Routine maintenance should be conducted between batches prior to final disinfection where a batch system is practiced. 4.2. Record Keeping OBJECTIVES To minimise the risk of introducing or spreading disease or contaminants by delivery and pick-up operations 4.2.1. Chicken mortality must be recorded on a daily basis to assist monitoring for any unusual health problems potentially indicating a biosecurity breach. Monitoring feed and water consumption and production data (such as body weights) can also assist in early identification of health issues. 4.2.2. A record of chicken movements must be maintained to facilitate tracing in case of an animal health or food safety concern. 4.3. End of Batch Procedures 4.3.1. After final pick-up the shed doors must be kept closed except during litter movement and shed disinfection. After washing and disinfecting, shed doors must be kept closed. If drying is a problem, ventilate using fans or place bird wire screens in shed doorways. Wild birds and animals must be kept out after disinfection. 4.3.2. Used litter and manure must not be stockpiled in the biosecure production area and must be stored in an appropriately designed storage area, off the biosecure production area, with a sufficient buffering zone from the chicken sheds and enclosures. Page 16 of 46 FREE-RANGE PRODUCTION 5. FREE RANGE PRODUCTION OPERATIONS Sections 1-4 of this manual apply equally to conventionally housed chickens and free-range operations. However, it is recognised that free-range chickens will have some exposure to wild birds and animals which can transmit pathogens to the chickens. In these environments measures should be taken to minimise the congregation of wild birds and animals near or on the range and the impacts of them generally, and these measures should be documented. 5.1. Entry Procedures for Ranges 5.1.1. Entry to free-range areas should be restricted to designated entry points with a footbath containing a suitable disinfectant used in accordance with company and manufacturer’s instructions and changed on a regular basis. 5.1.2. There must be provision for scraping the soles of boots before dipping to ensure the sanitiser is making contact with the soles of the boots. An alternative system is to use separate range area footwear. 5.1.3. Footbaths should be located in a position that is not accessible by the chickens. 5.1.4. Hand washing and/or sanitation facilities must be available and used before entering the range. 5.1.5. Facilities should be available for the cleaning and disinfection of equipment before entry. 5.2. Feed must not be placed on the range area. 5.3. Free Range Landscape – 5.3.1. Drainage – The range area should be adequately drained to prevent accumulation and stagnation of water likely to attract wild birds. Standing water may also increase the presence of insects which can act as disease vectors. Range areas should be contoured to limit the ingress of runoff water from other parts of the property. 5.3.2. Trees and shrubs that don’t encourage wild bird visitation or habitation should be selected for within the range area. The area around sheds must be kept free from debris and vegetation. 5.4. A baiting program for rodents must be implemented that reflects the assessed risk level using rodenticides that are approved for use in the production area. Such a baiting program for range areas must include the following features: 5.4.1. Bait stations must be numbered and a map kept of their location. 5.4.2. Bait stations must not be placed on the range area or in locations where chickens will be able to access them, unless it is a rodenticide approved for use in this area. 5.4.3. Bait stations must be placed at regular intervals around the range perimeter. The number of bait stations should be increased in areas where there are signs of increased rodent activity. Page 17 of 46 5.4.4. Bait stations must be checked frequently using a risk-based approach and fresh baits laid as required. 5.4.5. A record should be kept of each inspection and activity noted (see Appendix 5). 5.4.6. Bait stations must be designed to minimise the opportunity for other mammals and birds to access the bait. 5.5. Grass on and around the range area must be well maintained – Long grass attracts rodents and favours the survival of viruses and bacteria and encourages the presence of wild birds if allowed to seed. Irrigation water used on the range should be sanitised to reduce the risk of contaminating the range with pathogens that may transfer to the chickens on the range (refer to the National Water Biosecurity Manual). 5.6. Manure deposits outside the popholes must be removed after each batch. 5.6.1. Ramps from the shed to the range area must be scraped, cleaned and sanitised after each batch. 5.7. It should be standard practice to cull any chicken that escapes the range area. Page 18 of 46 REQUIREMENTS FOR CONTRACTORS, SERVICE PERSONNEL, SUPPLIERS AND OTHER VISITORS 6. Requirements for Contractors, service personnel, suppliers and other visitors OBJECTIVES To minimise the risk of introduction of disease or contaminants by contractors, suppliers, service personnel and visitors 6.1. DOCUMENTATION AND TRAINING Contractors, including pick-up crews, service personnel, suppliers and visitors present a major potential route for disease and pathogen transmission, as does the equipment they may bring with them. While these risks can’t be directly managed by the chicken grower, it is the responsibility of the chicken grower to be aware of the requirements in this section and facilitate adherence to these. Disease can be transmitted by, for example, hands, boots, clothing, hair and equipment and vehicles that have been transferred without decontamination. It is important for anyone entering chicken farms to be aware that there is potential for pathogen transmission to occur at any time and thus that they must be proactive at all times in ensuring biosecurity procedures are in place that will minimise the risk of pathogen transfer to the chickens. Contractors, service personnel, suppliers and other visitors must be aware of the requirements in sections 1-6 of this Manual; however this section specifically outlines their responsibilities for maintaining a high standard of biosecurity on Australian meat chicken farms. Prior communications with the chicken grower and/or processing company should ensure that there is a clear understanding by the contractor, service personnel, suppliers and visitors of their biosecurity responsibilities and policies of the chicken farm in this respect. OBJECTIVES To ensure awareness by and training of all contractors, suppliers, service personnel and visitors 6.1.1. All contractors, service personnel, suppliers and other visitors must agree to comply with the entry conditions as stipulated in Appendix 10A (not all the entry conditions detailed in Appendix 10A may apply to the pick-up crews and service personnel). All visits must be approved by the Manager before visitors may enter sheds and ranges. This requirement also applies to vaccination crews. 6.1.2. Visitors’ Log – A record must be kept of all contractors, service personnel, suppliers and other visitors to the biosecure production area including contractors and company personnel (see Appendix 10B regarding details to be recorded and a possible format). All visitors entering sheds or ranges must complete and sign the Visitors’ Log (see Appendix 10B). The only exceptions are detailed below in 6.1.3. Page 19 of 46 6.1.3. Exceptions – The only people who may enter the sheds and poultry ranges without signing the Visitors’ Log are personnel covered by the Personnel Quarantine Declaration (Appendix 9) such as farm personnel and members of pick-up crews. It is recommended that the pick-up foreman sign the Visitors’ Log for the entire crew. 6.1.4. Other deliveries (e.g. gas and feed drivers) – Drivers must confine their movements to the immediate vicinity of the truck and trailer and must not enter sheds. Whether drivers sign the Visitor’s log is at the discretion of the company, but the company that operates the trucks must have appropriate traceability records. 6.1.5. Where applicable, contractors, suppliers, service personnel and other visitors must be provided with training in the relevant parts of the Manual, at least the fundamentals of biosecurity and welfare, and such training is to be recorded. Whether the responsibility for this training is to be with the grower or the processing company is to be determined in each case. 6.1.6. There must be a system for tracing movements of delivery personnel and contractors (e.g. through delivery dockets and feed company records). 6.2. Equipment and Vehicles 6.2.1. Vehicles, modules and crates should be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected between farms. A thorough inspection of the vehicle and trailer should be undertaken prior to entry on the farm and the movements of the driver and crew validated. 6.2.2. Prior communications should ensure that there is a clear understanding by the contractor of their biosecurity responsibilities to minimise the spread of pathogens and the policies of the poultry farm operator. 6.2.3. Where chicken weighing is practiced, it must be carried out using the production area’s own weighing frames and scales. Company service personnel can use their own scales provided that they are cleaned and disinfected when moved between production areas. 6.2.4. Contractors, service personnel, suppliers and other visitors must park their vehicles outside the biosecure production area unless it is essential that the vehicle be taken on site e.g. maintenance contractors. Page 20 of 46 6.3. PERSONNEL STANDARDS AND PROCEDURES 6.3.1. Any authorised visitor, including neighbours, friends, other producers, contractors, service personnel and suppliers likely to have been exposed that day to poultry, other birds or pigs are not permitted entry to the biosecure production area unless additional company- specific risk management requirements are implemented and documented. 6.3.2. Contractors, suppliers, service personnel and other visitors must declare if they have been overseas in the 5 days prior to visiting the farm and follow the required company risk management which may include entry not being permitted. If contact with any poultry, pigs or other avian species was made while overseas in the 5 days prior to the visit then entry is not permitted. OBJECTIVES To minimise the risk of introducing or spreading a disease or contaminant through people movement, including: • Staff (including production personnel and company service personnel) • Contractors, suppliers and other service personnel • Visitors and family members and to document such movements to facilitate tracing in case of a concern. 6.3.3. Contractors, service personnel, suppliers and other visitors that are suffering from gastrointestinal disease or confirmed to be suffering from an infectious respiratory disease must not be allowed in the biosecure production area until fully recovered. 6.3.4. Contractors, service personnel, suppliers and other visitors must wear clean laundered clothes and clean boots/shoes and/or boot covers, clean (or new disposable) protective coveralls (including a change of coveralls and boot covers if moving from older to younger or from sick to healthy flocks). Coveralls (either clean or new disposable) should be made available on site or brought with the visitor (coverall requirements specified by the farm manager or company) and disposed of on site at the completion of the visit. 6.4. COMPANY SERVICE PERSONNEL OBJECTIVES To minimise the risk of introduction of disease or contaminants by company service personnel 6.4.1. Company service personnel by necessity make multiple production area visits on a single day. Protective clothing and footwear, as approved by the relevant company Manager, must be worn in the biosecure production area. Page 21 of 46 6.4.2. Visits must always be made from ‘cleaner’ areas i.e. home, farm with a higher quarantine status, younger flock or production area with a higher health status. In an emergency, visits may be made from ‘unclean’ areas to ‘clean’ but relevant risk management procedures must be implemented and documented. 6.5. REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE OBJECTIVES To minimise the risk of introduction of disease or contaminants by contractors carrying out maintenance and repair work 6.5.1. Repair and maintenance contractors who have had contact with poultry, other birds or pigs that day must not enter sheds and / or ranges populated or ready to be populated with chickens unless it is an emergency and relevant risk management procedures have been implemented and documented. 6.5.2. Routine maintenance should be conducted between batches prior to final disinfection where a batch system is practiced. 6.5.3. Tools taken into the biosecure production area must be thoroughly cleaned (and sanitised if possible) before entry into sheds and must be free of dust and organic matter. 6.6. PICK-UP CREW PERSONNEL OBJECTIVES To minimise the risk of introduction of disease or contaminants by pick-up crews, which is acknowledged as being a particularly high risk for disease transfer between flocks and farms. 6.6.1. All members of pick-up crews must be fully aware of the appropriate biosecurity measures applicable to pick-ups. 6.6.2. Pick-up crew members must not keep birds or pigs at their home. 6.6.3. Any person engaged in pick-up and/or transport of poultry must sign a personnel quarantine declaration (Appendix 9 may be adapted for this purpose). 6.6.4. Processors and pick-up contractors must be able to trace who worked on which properties and the date pick-up occurred. 6.6.5. It is a requirement that all pick-up personnel sanitise their boots and their hands prior to entering each shed on a farm. In the majority of commercial arrangements, the processor is responsible for organising pick-up and transport, while the task is often carried out by specialised contractor crews. The onus is on the processor to ensure that those involved in this operation are fully aware of the biosecurity requirements and have appropriate standards and procedures are in place, implemented and enforced, supported by documentation. Page 22 of 46 6.6.6. Scheduling farms for daily pick-up must consider farms or flocks with real or suspected health issues and schedule for these farms/flocks to be visited/picked up last. In most cases this is the responsibility of the processor. 6.6.7. Every 12 months all pick-up crew personnel must be screened for: 6.6.7.1. Nil contact with poultry, pet birds or pigs in home environment. 6.6.7.2. Nil contact with commercial caged birds, pigeons, hatcheries and non- commercial aviaries. 6.7. REQUIREMENTS FOR OTHER SPECIFIED MOVEMENTS OBJECTIVES To minimise the risk of introduction of disease or contaminants by specified movements 6.7.1. Day-old chick delivery – Trucks, forklifts and chick boxes must be cleaned and disinfected each day. Drivers must wear clean protective clothing and footwear prior to each delivery if entering sheds. Hands must be sanitised. Where it is necessary for the chick delivery truck to visit several farms during the one delivery run then measures must be put in place to ensure that risk of infectious agent spread between properties is minimised. 6.7.2. Fresh litter delivery and collection of manure and used litter – Trucks carrying new litter should be from reputable companies and not used for carting used litter and manure and should be cleaned and sanitised prior to use for clean bedding material. Page 23 of 46 7. EARLY ACTION IN THE EVENT OR SUSPICION OF AN EMERGENCY POULTRY DISEASE ON YOUR FARM OR IN YOUR AREA OBJECTIVES To protect the property from the increased threat of disease in the event of a suspected outbreak of an emergency disease in the area and to reduce the risks of spread of an emergency disease to other properties It is important for all chicken growers and those associated with the movement of poultry and entry to farms to be aware that there is potential for an Emergency Poultry Disease to occur at any time and to be proactive at all times to ensure biosecurity procedures are in place that will prevent the entry into the poultry operation and / or transmission of an emergency or serious endemic disease. However, there are specific procedures that are to be implemented immediately if there is suspicion of an Emergency Poultry Disease on your property or during an outbreak of an Emergency Poultry Disease in your region. These procedures may also be considered in the event of a serious outbreak of an endemic disease. 7.1.1. CLINICAL SIGNS TO BE MONITORED AND REPORTED 7.1. IF THERE IS SIGNIFICANT UNEXPLAINED DISEASE ON YOUR PROPERTY 1 These measures should also be implemented if an emergency disease has been confirmed on your property, but the state Department has not yet arrived to implement quarantine measures or issued instructions to you or your company. 2 If your initial company contact fails to respond to your call (you should leave a detailed message), then escalate your contact to another level in the company. If you have not received a call back from your company on the same day and you have reason to suspect an emergency disease (such as avian influenza or Newcastle disease) then you should ring the emergency disease hotline: 1800 675 888 These procedures must be implemented if there is unexplained disease on your property. 1 The grower is not expected to be able to recognise or diagnose emergency poultry diseases, and the clinical signs of such diseases can be seen in other poultry diseases. However, a grower should be on the lookout for the signs listed below and report them to your company immediately for further investigation. If any of the following signs are identified, immediately cease movement of people and equipment into and out of affected shed and farm until further investigation. A relevant company representative (such as a veterinarian, service person or livestock manager) must be contacted immediately with a direct conversation (text, email or other electronic messaging is not sufficient) in the case of 2: • Unexplained mortalities of 1% or more in 24 hours • Unusual symptoms in the flock, such as: - severe respiratory diseases symptoms - nervous signs - severe flock depression • Any decline of 5% per day for 2 consecutive days in one or more of the following: - feed consumption - water consumption Page 24 of 46 7.1.2. IF THERE IS SUSPICION OF AN EMERGENCY POULTRY DISEASE ON YOUR PROPERTY If a notifiable or emergency disease is suspected, your company will notify the relevant State department, who will investigate and institute any further actions necessary. In the meantime, here’s what you should do: 7.1.2.1. Cease all movement of people, animals, vehicles, litter and equipment to and from the affected shed and to and from the farm until further advice / instruction is received from your company or state Department. 7.1.2.2. Shut and lock all access points to the property 7.1.2.3. Stay on the property. 7.1.2.4. Lock all shed doors. 7.1.2.5. Ensure all footbaths and hand-wash stations are appropriately maintained at all times. 7.1.2.6. Use footbaths and hand-wash stations both on entering and leaving all sheds. 7.1.2.7. Use a dedicated set of shed boots for affected shed/s. 7.1.2.8. Double check that all dead chickens / dead bird disposal areas are covered or secured, so not accessible to pests or wild birds; cease removal from site immediately ie do not allow any dead chickens to be removed from the farm. 7.1.2.9. If free-range, return all chickens to their sheds as soon as possible and shut the sheds. 7.1.2.10. Minimise all staff movements into unaffected sheds on the farm. Where possible, designated staff member/s are to service the affected shed/s only. However, if it is deemed essential for the same individual(s) to enter apparently unaffected sheds, then they should only do so after a head- to-toe shower between shed entries and a complete change of clothes, footwear, hair covering and breathing protection after servicing an affected shed. Disinfect hands and boots prior to entering a shed in all cases. 7.1.2.11. Used farm and/or protective clothing and all used personal protection equipment must remain on the property. 7.1.2.12. Contact all staff (either on or off farm at the time) and advise them to not have any contact with birds, particularly poultry, and to thoroughly clean and disinfect all clothing that they have worn on farm and to stay at home until receiving further advice. 7.1.2.13. Contact all scheduled visitors (eg dead bird pick up contractors) and advise that they should not visit until further notice. Page 25 of 46 7.1.2.14. As some serious diseases (such as AI) can have potential impacts on human health, ensure all people who enter sheds use appropriate well-fitting facemasks, goggles, gloves, hairnets and full-length coveralls. Each farm should carry an emergency kit with appropriate safety gear (see “What to have ready …” opposite for details). Exercise good levels of personal hygiene. 7.1.2.15. Review visitor records for the batch to ensure all records are accurate as this may be a critical document in the event of exotic disease being confirmed. These procedures apply if there is an emergency poultry disease, such as AI or Newcastle disease, in your area 3, but not on your farm. After first confirming with your company that an emergency poultry disease has been found (or is strongly suspected) in your area, the following immediate measures should be adopted. These measures should remain in place until further advice or directions are received from your company or from your State Chief Veterinary Officer: 7.2. THERE IS AN EMERGENCY POULTRY DISEASE IN YOUR AREA BUT NOT ON YOUR PROPERTY 3 Your ‘area’ would be defined as a broad poultry production region in which there are movements of equipment, vehicles and contractors between farms. 4 The ‘production area’ includes the poultry sheds, the ranges used for free range production, the areas used for feed storage and handling and the area immediately surrounding the sheds, including pick-up areas. It may, but does not necessarily, also include other areas of the farm property, such as the manager’s home or other land on which the production area is located that is used for livestock or cultivation. 7.2.1. Gates must be kept locked. 7.2.2. Shed doors must be locked at night. 7.2.3. Facilities for the cleaning and disinfection of equipment coming on and off the biosecure production area 4 must be established and used. 7.2.4. No visitors are to enter the biosecure production area unless absolutely essential. 7.2.4.1. Company personnel to discontinue routine visits to other farms except on suspicion of problems. Page 26 of 46 7.2.4.2. Repairs and maintenance – no routine work; only emergency work to be carried out. 7.2.4.3. All other scheduled visits, such as audits, must be cancelled. 7.2.5. Company approval must be sought and granted before any visitor entry. 7.2.6. Essential visits – head-to-toe shower before and after visit. A complete change of clothes, footwear, hair covering and face mask is required prior to entering the biosecure production area. Farm and/or protective clothing and all personal protection equipment used on your farm must remain on the property. 7.2.7. Any vehicle (e.g. feed trucks, gas) which must enter the property must have its wheels and driver steps washed and disinfected before and after going onto the property. Vehicle driver cabins must also be sanitised inside (e.g. with Glen 20 disinfectant). 7.2.8. Free-range farms within 10 km of an infected property should return all chickens to their sheds as soon as possible and shut the sheds. 7.2.9. No chickens or litter to be moved on or off properties until further notice. WHAT TO HAVE READY IN ADVANCE OF EITHER SITUATION ABOVE OCCURRING: 9 Have an emergency kit with appropriate safety gear on farm at all times. This should include adequate supplies of well- fitting facemasks and breathing equipment (minimum specification P2), goggles, gloves, hairnets and full-length coveralls. 9 Have adequate supplies on farm of disinfectants for different purposes eg disinfectant for foot-baths, hand sanitiser, vehicle cabins (e.g. Glen 20). 9 A designated wash-down area and facilities to clean vehicles and equipment at the entry point to the production area. 9 Sheds must be lockable. 9 Consideration should be given to where showering would occur for people entering and leaving the property. 7.3. FURTHER MEASURES DURING AN EMERGENCY POULTRY DISEASE OUTBREAK Further measures (including movement controls) and standard operating procedures will be stipulated by your processor and/or the state’s Chief Veterinary Officer as the official response to the emergency disease in your area is implemented.

The biosecure production area must have a perimeter fence or otherwise well-defined boundary (e.g. creek, vegetation) establishing a clearly defined biosecurity zone. Sections of the production area boundary may also be the property boundary. Free-range areas are within the biosecure production area but require additional entry requirements (see 5.1). A map of the biosecure production area must be kept on site (example below). EXAMPLE Page 36 of 46 BIOSECURE PRODUCTION AREA It is recommended that a copy of the map identifying the biosecure production area be inserted here. Page 37 of 46 DEAD CHICKEN COLLECTION OBJECTIVES To eliminate as much as possible infection or contamination spreading between sheds and between batches. • Dead chickens must be collected regularly from the property (unless an alternative disposal system is in place to manage the risk). Frequency of collection will be determined by factors such as age of chickens, storage facilities and climatic conditions. • Dead chickens must be stored in a freezer if the time of collection, frequency of collection or weather conditions are likely to cause environmental impacts or increased biosecurity risk (e.g. if able to be accessed by animals and wild birds). • If used, the freezer must have sufficient capacity to adequately handle carcasses between collections and must be cleaned and sanitised between batches. • The collection area must be as far as practical away from the sheds and ideally in a location that means the collection vehicle does not need to enter the biosecure production area. • All containers used for collecting dead chickens must be washed and disinfected before returning them to the biosecure production area. APPENDIX 3 Page 38 of 46 APPENDIX 4 DEAD CHICKEN AND LITTER COMPOSTING OBJECTIVES To eliminate as much as possible infection or contamination spreading between sheds and between batches due to dead bird disposal. • Composting is the aerobic microbial breakdown of organic matter, usually incorporating a thermophilic 5 phase. Composting systems for poultry waste can reduce litter volume, dispose of carcasses, stabilise nutrients and trace elements and reduce pathogen loads. Dead chicken and litter composting must be carried out outside the biosecure production area and as far away as possible (unless resources are available to adequately compost litter in sheds). • Rodents, cats, dogs, feral animals, scavenging birds and flies must be kept away from composting carcasses. • Composting areas must be away from sheds and boundary fences. • Composting areas must be kept neat and clean at all times. • Cleaning and disinfection of equipment such as bins, buckets and wheelbarrows must be done before returning them to the biosecure production area and when moving between sheds. • Adequate Instructions / Guidelines for safe composting must be used. 5Thermophilic phase – a phase during which there is a temperature rise in the compost sufficient to inactivate pathogenic micro-organisms Page 39 of 46 APPENDIX 5 RODENT CONTROL RECORD RODENT CONTROL RECORD Date Time Bait Station No. Activity Level Corrective Action Name or Initials Page 40 of 46 APPENDIX 6 SURFACE WATER TREATMENT OBJECTIVES To eliminate as much as possible infection or contamination by means of contaminated water, particularly through contamination by faeces from infected wild birds, e.g. ducks. WATER TREATMENT CHECKLIST The use of potable water free of potential avian pathogens is critical to achieving good biosecurity to minimise bacteria, viruses, algae and other organisms that chickens consume in their drinking water, and that they are exposed to through shed cooling systems. Effective treatment of surface water to reduce contamination and eliminate avian disease agents is essential but can be technically difficult and any water treatment process should be monitored regularly. Water with a high level of organic matter, or low or high pH, may be difficult to sanitise without having the appropriate pre- treatment. Ultraviolet treatment of water is limited to low flow rate clean water with no turbidity. It may be necessary to seek expert advice to ensure a safe water supply. There are a number of ways to treat surface water and further detail is provided in the National Water Biosecurity Manual. • Surface water or water from sources that does not meet the water quality standards (Appendix 7) must not be supplied to meat chickens or used for cooling. • Water used for shed cleaning and range irrigation water should also be treated prior to use. • All surface water that comes from sources other than the mains (e.g. from dams, rivers) must be treated on the farm before being used for supply to the chickens. Bore water must be tested and if not satisfying the water quality guidelines set out in Appendix 7, must be treated. • Chlorination monitoring systems that are appropriate to the system used, are available from companies that supply chlorination equipment. • Chemical concentrations at the end of the drinker line may be low when intake is low (eg. during brooding or early in the morning). Water lines may need to be flushed more regularly during this period to ensure water disinfection systems are operating optimally. • To ensure efficacy of treatment in reducing the risk of introducing a pathogen into the shed the water treatment system must be tested daily at water input. This testing must be recorded (see Appendix 8) and accompanied by records of the maintenance program. Water quality should be tested at output to monitor waterline cleanliness. • Microbiological validation of the efficacy of the treatment system must be carried out at least once a year.
