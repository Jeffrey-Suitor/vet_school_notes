They support the State’s primary animal welfare legislation to prevent or minimise harm through regulation of specific activities. • The regulations cover: • transport of animals • prohibited devices • pain relief for mulesing and overgrown wool on sheep - must administer pain relief • fruit tree netting • electrical devices including electronic collars • traps and oxy-LPG devices • rodeos • use of animals in scientific procedures and teaching. • Animal Welfare Victoria developed the POCTA Regulations 2019 to replace the expiring POCTA Regulations 2008. Sheep and goats standards and guidelines • General responsibilities (education and application of knowledge) • Feed and water requirements • Risk management – environment, predation, disease etc • Appropriate facilities and equipment (doesn’t need to be new) • Handling and husbandry • Tail docking and castration (disbudding/dehorning goats) • Mulesing (not for goats) • Breeding management • Dairy management (goats) • Intensive sheep production systems (intensive goat systems) • Humane killing Standards and guidelines • Base level requirement that MUST be achieved (standards) • Guidelines are what most of industry achieves • Challenge to formulate these sorts of guidelines across a country with dramatically different production systems – hence the variation Livestock transport – Land transport S & G Image from @GusWhyte • Fit to load guidelines https://www.integritysystems.com.au/globalassets/i sc/pdf-files/fit-to-load.pdf Role of the veterinarian and POCTA & Standards and Guidelines • Veterinarians have important role in a number of situations • Private practitioner • Advise on optimal methods/drugs for range of husbandry procedures • General production systems advice – disease, risk mitigation (predation, weather), vaccination, drench etc • Government vet or RSPCA – investigation/legal • Industry – products to improve husbandry • Research – better options for husbandry and define welfare Improving animal welfare • Controversial procedures • Mulesing • Live sheep export • Castration/docking Mulesing • Sheep mulesed to remove wrinkle • Can also be achieved over a number of generations by genetic selection • In Victoria MUST use analgesic at time of mulesing https://www.wool.com/sheep/welfare/breech- flystrike/analgesia-anaesthesia/ https://www.wool.com/globalassets/wool/sheep/welfare/breech-flystrike/breeding-for-breech-strike- resistance/visual-sheep-scores-producer-version-2019.pdf Mulesing continued • Introduced originally by Mr Mules (hence name) when no other options in 1930s • Many producers moving towards unmulesed flocks (some not) by genetic selection but takes time • Interim program (?) of pain relief • Customer accept ? Live sheep export • Probably the most controversial Australian sheep issue • Sheep sent from Australia to middle east McCarthy Review • Changes implemented by the Middle East Order aimed to more adequately address the risk of heat stress in the Northern Hemisphere summer and included requirements for: • exporters to have a heat stress management plan for each voyage • a reduction in the reportable (mortality) level from 2% to 1% • stocking densities calculated using allometric principles (section 1.2.6) • independent verification of pen air turnover (PAT) • 10% extra space for horned rams • Kuwait to be the first port of unloading for the vessel if it is one of the destination ports • all vessels to be installed with automated watering systems • provision of additional bedding. • The Northern Winter Order applies to voyages of sheep to, or through, the Middle East departing Australia between the months of November to April. Amongst other conditions, the Northern Winter Order gives sheep 17.5% additional space compared with the ASEL (version 2.3). The Northern Winter Order is beyond the scope of this RIS and therefore not considered further. Mortality to animal welfare basis • Mortality = crude measure of animal welfare- overall mortality rate for sheep during sea transport to all destinations during 2018 was 0.46% (5,202 mortalities in 1.14 million sheep exported) • Average duration 18 days • Welfare impacts prior to mortality https://www.mla.com.au/research-and-development/search- rd-reports/final-report-details/National-livestock-export- industry-sheep-cattle-and-goat-transport-performance-report- 2017/3852 Average and range • Important not just to consider average annual loss • Particular times/voyages worse? Castration & docking (& all marking procedures) • Almost all lambs are castrated and docked – except some live export lambs are not (market requires entire rams with tails) • Lambs docked to reduce fly issues • Rams castrated for meat quality, aggression, unwanted pregnancy • Painful procedure however it is carried out, just because there is no blood is NOT equivalent to no pain e.g. using rings, may not see pain until out of yards • Analgesia/anaesthesia – new products on market, Numnuts to put local anaesthetic into correct position, trisolfen if in conjunction with mulesing, NSAIDs for pain relief Education • Ensuring next generation educated in animal needs to meet S & G requirements around education • Not just always “continue how always done” (not logical to expect positive change if that is what is needed) • Social license – changes in a range of livestock management procedures, more science input e.g. stronger AVA policy on live export (but varying opinions exist in the organisation and broadly in society)","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
