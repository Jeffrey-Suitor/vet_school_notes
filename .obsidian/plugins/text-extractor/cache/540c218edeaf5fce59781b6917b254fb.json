French equation • 680mm • French equation (SR/ha) = 1.3 * ( 680-250)/25 = 22.36 DSH/ha • 1000 hectare * 22.36 DSE/ha = 22360 DSE • Ie.. This property could manage 22,360 Merino wethers (or non pregnancy ewes) through winter. • But we actually have 65% sheep and 35% cattle in DSE so this means we have: • 0.65 * 22360 DSE sheep = 14534 DSE in sheep • 0.35 * 22360 DSE cattle = 7826 DSE on cattle • (we can check no mistakes by adding the DSE – should equal 22360) Exercise 2: Trace element deficiency • In mid September 2014, two separate properties were attended due to lameness progressing to weakness, collapse and death in spring born merino lambs. Property 1 • Property 1 only had one mob of ewes clinically affected. These were 2 year old, maiden, fine wool merino ewes that had not received trace element in their pre-lambing drench. They were grazing on country that had not received any superphosphate for more than 15 years, but it was one of their better pastures and had grown more clover than other paddocks. The property has acidic granite based soils, and the annual rainfall for 2014 was >700mm. • Three dead lambs had been found in the paddock over the previous week. The examined lamb was able to stand but unable to walk without dragging the hind legs. It appeared to be a hind limb stiffness and paresis. There was no swelling of any of the joints, its temperature was normal, it was bright and alert with pink mucous membranes Property 2 • Property 2 had an outbreak of affected lambs in a mob of 220 maiden fine wool merino ewes. This property had a history of regular superphosphate use. In the previous 4 years in each year they had applied 100kgs/hectare single superphosphate to the paddocks. The soil type is pipe clay and soil ph (CaCl) levels generally sit around about pH 4.5. Annual rainfall for the previous 12 months had exceeded 700mm. The paddock that these sheep were in had been grazed short the previous summer and had a fantastic clover response in the autumn. The winter was mild and the clover grew unchecked into the spring. The owner estimated that the spring pasture was 80-90% clover. • Research • What trace element is most likely responsible for these signs? • What options are there to test to assess this was the problem? • How could you reduce the problem immediately and for the longer term? Too much/too little • In what areas would you expect to see signs of trace element deficiency and why? • What are likely events leading to trace element toxicity (too much)?","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
