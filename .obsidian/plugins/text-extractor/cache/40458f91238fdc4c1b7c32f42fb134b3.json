Appraisal of motor areas of the brain about muscle length and tension. 2. Control of muscle length and tension in a negative-feedback fashion by means of local spinal reflexes Conceptual hierarchical organisation of motor control Motor neurons are influenced by 1. Local reflex circuitry 2. Descending pathways from the brain stem and cerebral cortex Components of a simple reflex Afferent arm (input) Efferent arm (output) Integration centre (interneuron) Sensor (receptor) Response element Interneurons • Most descending synaptic input does not go directly to motor neurons • Synapse with interneurons which synapse with motor neurons • 90% of spinal cord neurons • Integrate input from higher centres, peripheral receptors and other interneurons Local Afferent Input • Afferent fibres carry information from sensory receptors in three sources 1. In skeletal muscles controlled by motor neurons 2. In other nearby muscles, especially antagonists 3. In the tendons, joints, and skin of body parts affected by muscle action Muscle Spindle • located within fleshy part of muscle • Intrafusal fibers parallel to extrafusal fibers • Noncontractile central portion • Detects: - rate of change at which the muscle fibers are stretched - changes in length of muscle fibers • aids in coordination and efficiency of muscle contraction Muscle Spindle Types of nerve fibres in muscle spindle • Nuclear bag fibres – Large number nuclei packed into mid-portion – Sense onset of stretch • Nuclear chain fibres – Nuclei in longitudinal row – Sense sustained stretch • Both are activated with rapid stretch Muscle Spindle ~ Nerve supply • Efferent neuron which innervates intrafusal fibres = gamma (g) motor neuron • Extrafusal fibres = alpha (a) motor neuron Muscle Spindle • Muscle spindles are attached by connective tissue in parallel to the extrafusal fibres. • External force stretching the muscle also stretches the intrafusal fibres activating their receptor endings Co-activation of g and a motor neurons The more or the faster the muscle is stretched, the greater the rate of receptor firing Stretch Reflex Similar things happens when a quick change in posture is made Reciprocal InnervationStretch reflex • The stretch, or myotactic, reflex – Produces rapid corrections of motor output in the moment to moment control of movement – Forms the basis for postural reflexes to maintain body position. Golgi tendon organ • located at junction of tendon and muscle • detects: - force of muscle contraction - tension applied to tendon • protects tendon and muscle from excessive tension • A large diameter myelinated type 1b axon arises from each GTO • Muscle contraction stretches the GTO and generates AP • Greater the force of contraction higher firing rate Golgi Tendon OrgansTendon reflex Inhibitory post synaptic potential THE END Dr Babatunde Ayodele awodeleb@unimelb.edu.au VETS30015 / VETS90121","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
