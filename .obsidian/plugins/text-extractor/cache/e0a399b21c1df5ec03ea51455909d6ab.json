These causes include congenital malformations, external compression of the intestines, and luminal obstruction by food, faeces, parasites, foreign bodies, scar tissue or neoplastic tissue. We will also review the variety of vascular accidents that can lead to venous or, less often, arterial infarction of bowel segments. The potential consequences of proximal versus distal intestinal obstruction will also be highlighted. F U R T H E R R E A D I N G H. B. Gelberg. Alimentary system.
