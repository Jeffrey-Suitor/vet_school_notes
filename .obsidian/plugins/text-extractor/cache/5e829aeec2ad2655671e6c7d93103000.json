Intended Learning Outcomes for Cells to Systems • Explain how the structural and functional organisation of the cells, tissues, organs and body systems enable maintenance of homeostasis • Communicate anatomical and microscopic features of animal tissues using scientific terminology • Explain how homeostasis is maintained through normal hormonal, electrical and pharmacological communication • Describe the major components of the immune system and the clinical manifestations of an activated immune response • Apply the principles of common inflammatory and non-inflammatory pathological processes to explain the clinical features of disease • Interpret data acquired from clinical cases, and apply understanding of the cellular and system structure and function in order to analyse and interpret clinical problems Your feedback on this module will be very much appreciated by the Faculty (and will be actively sought during Semester 1).

Neuromuscular communication 2: contraction of smooth muscle and skeletal muscle • The mechanics of muscle contraction- sliding filament theory and the power stroke • The role of calcium in contraction of smooth and skeletal muscle • Energy cycling in active muscle • Grading the contractile response- recruitment of motor units, summation and tetanus • Excitation-contraction coupling in smooth muscle 19. Reflex arc: spinal reflex control of skeletal muscle contraction • The different types of lower motor neurons that contribute to reflex arcs • The structure and function of intra- and extrafusal muscle fibres • The structure and function of muscle spindles and golgi tendon organs • How a reflex arc works Outcomes Clinical Skills • Apply physiological principles and clinical reasoning to explain an animal’s presenting signs. Scientific Basis of Clinical Practice  Describe the ways in which cells communicate with one another  Describe the role of the major hormones in regulating organ function  Describe the site of origin and structural features of the major classes of hormones  Explain how hormone secretion is regulated, and the factors that determine duration of hormone effect  Describe the major types of cell surface receptors and the mechanisms by which signals alter cell function responsible for such mineral deposition will be reviewed briefly and the typical gross and microscopic appearance illustrated. The definition of dystrophic mineralisation will also be compared with that of metastatic mineralisation. Further Reading MA Miller and JF Zachary.
