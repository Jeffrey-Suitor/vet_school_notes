The canine radiographs below are to illustrate anatomical relationships. You are not expected to be able to interpret radiographic images for assessment purposes. Lateral mandibular projection showing P4, M1 (carnassial), M2, M3. Oblique maxillary projection projection showing I3, C, P1, P2, P3. Note the retained deciduous canine tooth, which will need to be extracted to prevent malalignment/malocclusion of the permanent canine tooth from developing. I3 P4 M1 M2 M3 C P1 P2 P3 Retained deciduous canine tooth Canine dental radiographs from the American Veterinary Dental College For illustration of anatomical relationships only. Note the relative depths, and number of roots for each tooth. You are not expected to be able to interpret radiographic images. Note that Triadan system for numbering teeth is used in the radiographic images. See the image below for further explanation. This is for reference only, you do not need to be familiar with this numbering system, but have a think about which teeth correspond to the various numbers (e.g. 103 = upper right third incisor [I3]; or 309 = lower left first molar [M1]/carnassial tooth). rvc.ac.uk Feline dental radiographs from the American Veterinary Dental College For illustration of anatomical relationships only.

Anatomic dissection for comparison (slide from C. Murray, Lecture 2) Note overlap of teeth from left and right sides Puppy dentition Canine deciduous dental formula: 3 1 3 0 3 1 3 0 Retained deciduous teeth can cause problems with proper eruption and alignment of permanent teeth, causing malocclusion. This puppy has retained deciduous canine teeth. What age would you expect permanent canine teeth to erupt? (Hint: use the chart in the notes for Lecture 3). NB: Discussion of eruption times are for information/interest only and are not examinable in this subject. Use the aging chart provided in the notes for Lecture 3 to estimate the age of this puppy. Answers on next slide, so have a go first! Use the aging chart provided in the notes for Lecture 3 to estimate the age of this puppy. Permanent I1 & I2 have fully erupted. Permanent I3 has erupted but crown not completely visible. Deciduous canines are still present. Puppy estimated to be 5 months of age. Ageing sheep and goats Courtesy of Infovets.com C. Murray, Lecture 3 notes Use the aging chart provided in the notes for Lecture 3 to estimate the age of these sheep. Answers on next slide, so have a go first! In Australia, the definition of ‘lamb’ has traditionally been sheep with no erupted permanent incisors. Recently, the definition has changed to include ‘young sheep under 12 months of age or which do not have any permanent incisor teeth in wear’. So based on this definition, the sheep on the right would be a ‘lamb’ (more valuable), while the sheep on the left would be a ‘hogget’ (less valuable). Use the aging chart provided in the notes for Lecture 3 to estimate the age of these sheep. This sheep has two permanent incisors (I1) that are in wear (‘two tooth’), which would place this sheep at 12-18 months of age. This sheep has one erupted permanent incisor (I1) that is not yet in wear, which would place it around 12 months of age.","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
