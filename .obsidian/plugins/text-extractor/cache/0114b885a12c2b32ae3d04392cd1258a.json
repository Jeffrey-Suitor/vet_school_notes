Ruminants Suborder Ruminantia: 66 living genera and 164 living species • Family Bovidae: – Cattle, gazelles, African antelopes, buffalo, sheep, goats – 137 species in 45 genera – Size: 25 cm – 2 m; weight 3 kg – 1300 kg • Family Antilocapridae: the pronghorn – Around 60 kg Ruminants • Family Tragulinidae: Mouse deer – Only 3 chambered stomach (evolutionary link); 2 kg • Family Moschidae: Musk deer – Enlarged upper canines, ~10kg • Family Cervidae: Deer – Deer, moose, elk, caribou • Family Giraffidae: Giraffes – weights from 250 kg(okapi) to over 1500 kg (giraffes) Ruminants • Suborder Tylopoda • Family Camelidae: camels, dromedaries, llamas, alpacas, vicunas Why ruminate? • Ruminate (Latin: “chewed over”) • Fermentation↑ → energy yield ↑ from low energy food • Main aim of “chewing over”: particle size ↓ → surface area for bacteria ↑ Advantages Rumen provides safe space for bacteria -> can break down cellulose links efficient conversion of low quality feeds (dry grasses, thorn scrubs (giraffe)) great tolerance for dry conditions: substantial water & salt conservation (‘recycling’) Can eat fast and re-masticate later Disadvantages Prolonged digestive processes Low energy food → require large areas of pasture Complicated digestive processing (requires microbiota, partitioning of digesta, conservation of electrolytes and water) High quality diet gets absorbed by bacteria (can’t be utilised by cow) Forestomach –function 1. Fermentation chamber (digestion by microbes) – Absorption of volatile fatty acids Rumen population and fermentation The rumen ecosystem: • (facultative) anaerobic bacteria 10 to 100 billion cells/ g • Fungi • Protozoa (good markers for healthy rumen pH) 1 million cells/ g Current world population: 7.7 billion Functions: • Break down cellulose and hemicellulose into simple sugars that they digest → produce volatile fatty acids (VFA) as waste product → absorbed through rumen wall → 60-80% of dietary energy for cow • Continuous absorption important to allow rumen pH to stay stable (volatile fatty acids) Pyruvate Lactate/ Succinate CO2 CH4 Butyrate Acetate Acetyl-CoA VFA gas Hexose Cellulose Starch Sugars Fermentation and VFA PentoseEnergy for host Propionate VFA absorption Form follows function (in the rumen, too): • Rumen papillae → surface area↑ →absorption↑ VFA stimulate papilla growth • Lining: stratified squamous epithelium – Capable of absorbing VFAs, electrolytes and water AND to withstand abrasive forces Rumen population and fermentation The rumen ecosystem: • (facultative) anaerobic bacteria • Fungi • Protozoa (good markers for healthy rumen pH) → Produce volatile fatty acids (VFA) → dietary energy → Great source of good quality protein for the cow: bacteria combine nitrogen from urea/ ammonium with parts of carbohydrates → produce all essential amino acids → dead bacteria are a great source of amino acids getting absorbed in SI Rumen fermentation Sudden high grain diet lactic acid ↑ VFA production ↑ rumen pH ↓ rumen pH < 5.7 cellulytic bacteria die epithelium damage release endotoxins shock Endotoxins enter bloodstream lactic acid digesting bacteria ↑ VFA absorption ↑ Forestomach –function 1. Fermentation chamber (digestion by microbes) – Absorption of volatile fatty acids 2. Mixing of ingesta 3. Separation of ingesta (selective cranial and caudal movement) WHY? Forestomach –function 1. Fermentation chamber (digestion by microbes) – Absorption of volatile fatty acids 2. Mixing of ingesta – Mixing fibres with bacteria 3. Separation of ingesta (selective cranial and caudal movement) – Regurgitation of inadequately digested material (→ remastication) – Eructation of gas (~ 60 L per hour!) HOW? Rumination - musculature 2 muscle layers (perpendicular) Rumination - musculature Dyce, Sack, Wensing: Textbook of Veterinary Anatomy, 4th Edition 1 – reticulum 2- omasum 3 – abomasum 4 – rumen Reticulo-ruminal musculaturePillars and foldsOrientation 1) Where is today’s hay? 2) Where is yesterday’s hay? 3) Where is the gas produced by fermenting the hay? OrientationPrimary (mixing) contraction 1. Double contraction of reticulum (~ 1 min) → Propels liquid contents into cranial sac → Propels fibre contents into dorsal sac 2. Cranial sac and cranial pillar contract → Directs flow into dorsal sac 3. Dorsal sac contracts → Directs flow into ventral sac (through raft) 4. ventral sac contracts → Directs flow forward over relaxed cranial pillar Repeat about 3x/2 min → Longitudinal fold keeps raft in place Rumen contractile sequence Reticulo-rumen motilitySecondary (eructation) contraction 1. Double contraction of reticulum 2. Cranial sac and cranial pillar contract 3. Dorsal sac contracts 4. ventral sac contracts → Directs flow forward over relaxed cranial pillar Every 3rd -5th contraction, more often during feeding 4. ventral sac contracts → Directs flow forward, cranial pillar remains contracted, redirecting the rumen content dorsally instead → gas cap tightens 5. Dorsal sac contracts a second time from caudal to cranial → Moves gas in front of cardia 6. Cardia relaxes (if no fluid present) →Gas is sucked into oesophagus → retroperistaltic contractions move gas towards mouth 7. Ventral sac contracts again, cranial pillar relaxes and ingesta moves over relaxed pillar 8. Gas gets inspirated to avoid burping sound Rumen contractile sequenceRumination • 4 phases: – Regurgitation – Remastication – Resalivation – Redeglutination • Reflex stimulated by mechanical receptors in the mucosa around the cardia (rumen and reticulum) Rumination 1. Reticulum contraction with relaxed cardia →Partially fermented fibres enter oesophagus 2. Animal inspires against closed glottis → negative intrathoracic pressure → aspiration of fibres into distal E. 3. Retroperistaltic contractions of E. → Bolus moves towards mouth 4. In the mouth, liquid is squeezed out and swallowed → bolus is re-insalivated and re-masticated → It is swallowed after contraction cycle finished 4. At the same time, rumen undergoes primary contraction (or secondary contraction with eructation) Stimulated by fiber detected by mechanoreceptors in reticulum, rumino-reticular fold and cardia Grazing cattle spend 8 h per day ruminating unless stressed or disturbed.

Separation of ingesta (selective cranial and caudal movement) – Regurgitation of inadequately digested material 4. Buffer rumen contents to maintain optimal pH while conserving electrolytes and water through recirculation Salivary glands • Three major paired salivary glands • Numerous unpaired or diffuse “salivary” glands • Serous (parotid), mucous, or mixed (mandibular, sublingual) secretions Functions: → Keeping mucosal surfaces moist → protecting surfaces → predigesting food → Moistening food → Keeping rumen homeostasis!! Salivary glands How many litres of saliva does a cow secrete in 24 hours?? • 100-200L a day!!

Reflex stimulation of flow from buccal region only Four major functions: 1) recycling salt absorbed from gut; 2) recycling water from gut; 3) maintaining the pH (7.4) of the reticulo-rumen; 4) maintaining an optimal electrolyte concentration in the reticulo-rumen. The saliva effectively reduces the amount of water and electrolytes which have to be consumed by reusing them. Purpose of the parotid glandForestomach –function 1.

Separation of ingesta (selective cranial and caudal movement) – Regurgitation of inadequately digested material 4. Buffer rumen contents to maintain optimal pH while conserving electrolytes and water through recirculation Summary • Rumination allows high yield metabolism of low-nutrient yield food • Water and electrolyte conservation mechanisms are essential for this process • Rumination and salivation are controlled on different levels, including through reflexes and through the autonomic nervous system • Saliva composition varies between salivary glands and depending on stimuli • Born without adult rumen flora → start eating small amounts of roughage with about 1-2 weeks → develop adult rumen flora within the first 2-3 months • Gastric groove young ruminants • Reflex that shunts milk from oesophagus to omasum → prevents it from entering the rumen where it would ferment (turn sour) and colostral antibodies may be destroyed → delivers high-quality milk protein directly to abomasum without ‘losing’ it to the developing rumen flora • Initiated by suckling action + presence of certain milk proteins/ electrolytes gastric groove oesophageal orifice reticulo-omasal orifice left lip of groove\r (omasal muscle) right lip of groove (reticular muscle) CRANIAL CAUDAL Camelids [Suborder Tylopoda -Family Camelidae: camels, dromedaries, llamas, alpacas, vicunas] • Possess 3 chambers (omasum equivalent missing) • Chamber 1 and 2 – fermentation vats – Unique saccules (=invaginations) in ventral portion → surface area↑ → absorption of VFA↑ – Ingesta is homogenously mixed (no layers) – Can spit regurgitated material from chamber 1 • Chamber 3 – last 1/3 is glandular, rest is also for fermentation Case 1 History Cattle were moved to new pasture with lots of Lucerne (=alfalfa) 2 days before Symptoms Distended left abdomen, reluctance to move, rapid breathing, some cows are dead Additional information Alfalfa contains saponins that create foam when mixed with rumen fluid Think about what may have happened! Case 1 Pathophysiology Sensors near cardia interpret foam as fluid → will not stimulate relaxation of cardiac sphincter → Gas builds up → rumen distends → pushes on diaphragm → cows have difficulty breathing → will eventually suffocate Diagnosis (primary) bloat Treatment Depending on severity – antifrothing agent, tube inserted through oesophagus or trochar through abdominal wall reduce abdominal pressure Symptoms Sharp fall in milk production, eats poorly Arched back, reluctance to move, anxious, uneasy gait Clinical and laboratory findings Sudden onset of rumino-reticular atony positive withers pinch test (cow grunts when pressure is applied to withers) Positive bar test (cow grunts when pressure is applied to xyphoid area and removed suddenly) Increased rectal temperature (40° C) Neutrophilia with left shift, High Plasma fibrinogen Case 2 Pathophysiology Cows save most of their chewing for rumination → ingestion of wire/ nail (heavier than food) → falls into reticulum → reticular contractions lead to pierced wall → rumen bacteria are introduced into peritoneum → peritonitis → pain Diagnosis Traumatic reticulo-peritonitis/ Hardware disease Treatment Magnet and broad-spectrum antimicrobials Case 2","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
