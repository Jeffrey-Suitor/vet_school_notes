What gross lesions might you expect to find in the livers of animals that have died from one of these conditions? • What is the typical gross pattern of lesions in multifocal (or embolic) hepatitis? What are some agents that commonly cause this pattern of inflammation in domestic animals? • What is a useful macroscopic (gross) clue that indicates multifocal hepatitis is likely to be due to parasite migration? Name some parasites that commonly migrate through the liver of domestic animals. What are the potential consequences of transhepatic migration of parasites? • Zonal hepatitis is an unusual pattern of hepatitis that can mimic hypoxic and toxic insults to the liver. Name two conditions in domestic animals that characteristically produce zonal hepatitis. • What are the characteristic features of chronic hepatitis in dogs? What is known about the causes of this condition? • In which canine breeds is chronic hepatitis associated with copper storage? In which breeds is the copper storage thought to be primary (rather than secondary to cholestasis)? • What is meant by the terms cholangitis, cholangiohepatitis and cholecystitis? • What are the typical gross lesions of chronic fascioliasis in sheep and in cattle? Veterinary Bioscience: Metabolism Lecture 14 2 • How do bacteria reach the biliary tree to cause cholangitis, cholangiohepatitis and/or cholecystitis? Which domestic animal species commonly develop bacterial cholangitis/cholangiohepatitis? What would you expect to see grossly in the bile ducts of affected animals? • What are the typical lesions of chronic lymphocytic cholangitis/cholangiohepatitis in cats? What is thought to be the pathogenesis of this disease? • Outline the aetiology, pathogenesis and typical lesions of facial eczema in ruminants. • What is tribulosis? What is distinctive about the histological lesions in the liver? • How common are gall stones in domestic animals? Why do they form and what are the potential consequences? • What is a gall bladder mucocoele? In which species is this condition seen? What predisposes to this condition? What are the potential consequences? • What are potential causes of extra-hepatic bile duct obstruction? • What is the most likely cause of bile peritonitis? What are the potential consequences?
