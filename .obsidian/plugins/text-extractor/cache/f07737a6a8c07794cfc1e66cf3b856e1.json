P RAC T I C AL O V ERV I EW M A TE R I A LS SU P P L I E D Each group will be supplied with a liver from a sheep and/or pig. In addition, demonstration specimens on the centre tables will include livers from the dog, horse, pig and cow. A cadaver will be used to demonstrate the surface anatomical landmarks associated with percutaneous liver biopsy in the dog. S HEEP / P I G L I V ER S Identify the visceral and diaphragmatic surface, and the porta. Examine the following: Lobes - (the diagram below may help) Vessels - hepatic artery, portal vein, hepatic veins, caudal vena cava Hepatic lymph nodes Biliary system - hepatic ducts, common hepatic duct, cystic duct, bile duct, gall bladder Lobulation - Incise through one of the liver lobes with a scalpel. Note the thickness of the liver capsule and the consistency of the underlying tissue. - Observe the cut surface of the pig liver for clearly marked lobules. - Look for lobulation in the other species. Ligaments - (may not be present) - round, coronary, triangular, falciform, hepatogastric and hepatoduodenal (= lesser omentum) The liver of domestic mammals (from Nickel, Schummer and Seiferle.
