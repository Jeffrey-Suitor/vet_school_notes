Prof. Tudor completed a PhD in the Faculty of Medicine at Monash University. She has worked in private small animal practice in Melbourne. Liz was for ten years the Associate Dean Curriculum in FVAS, and in this role oversaw the development and delivery of the Melbourne DVM. She is deeply committed to Aboriginal reconciliation, and for the past 16 years has led dog health programs in remote Aboriginal communities in Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory, Australia. etudor@unimelb.edu.au I N T E N D E D L E A R N I N G O U T C O M E S At the end of this lecture, you should be able to: - Explain the features of gastrointestinal smooth muscle that provide for its autonomous activity and describe the hierarchy of neural and hormonal pathways that control secretory and motor activity in the gastrointestinal tract. - Describe the contractile patterns characteristic of gastric motility and explain their purpose, and explain how the structural and functional properties of gastric smooth muscle permit changes in volume with minimal changes in intra-luminal pressure. - Explain the mechanisms responsible for gastric emptying, the complex mechanisms that control this process and describe the characteristic motility forms of the small intestine. - Explain how different classes of drugs, including pro kinetics, laxatives and antispasmodics, can be used to either increase or decrease gut motility.

L E C T U R E O V E R V I E W The digestive system performs four basic functions- motility, secretion, digestion and absorption of ingested food. Of these secretion and motility exhibit the highest degree of control. Motility of the gut is provided for by layers of smooth muscle- circular and longitudinal, along the length of the gut. The sequenced contraction and relaxation of these muscle layers allow for mixing of ingested food with secretions, mechanical breakdown of food particles, propulsion of food along the gut tube and periodic release of chyme through sphincters from one region of the gut to the next. This lecture will describe the range of motility forms characteristic of gut smooth muscle and introduce you to the control mechanisms that modulate motility, particularly in the stomach.
