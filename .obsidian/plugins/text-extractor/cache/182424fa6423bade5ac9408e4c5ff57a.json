Cells of myocardium 2. Rhythmically active self excitatory “pacemaker” cells 3. Purkinje fibres, specialised conducting pathways which enhance spread of localised excitation Excitation contraction coupling • AP spreads along plasma membrane and invades T tubules • This opens voltage sensitive Ca++ channels in T-tubule membrane • Diffusion of extra-cellular calcium Excitation contraction coupling • Extracellular Ca++ stimulates release of Ca++ from SR • Results in contraction (systole) • Strength of contraction dependent on presence and concentration of extracellular Ca++ Cardiac muscle force - Contractility • Influenced by • Ca++ levels • Hormones (epinephrine) • Nervous (autonomic) • Extent of stretch • Cardiac muscle operates in a range of lengths shorter than optimal Smooth Muscle Contraction • Contraction is mediated by actin and myosin cross- bridge cycling • Undefined sarcomere structure • Cells bound together by basement membrane and transmits force • Lack T-tubules • Small membrane invaginations called caveoli • SR if rudimentary Dense bodies • Actin filaments attached to dense bodies • Dense bodies are attached to membrane • Linked by diagonal network of intermediate filaments (desmin) Smooth Muscle • Thick filaments • Myosin • Thin filaments • Actin, tropomyosin and calmodulin • NO Troponin • Myosin heads along entire length Multi-unit Smooth Muscle • Individual cells • Discrete innervation - Individual activity • Few gap junctions • Poor response to stretch • Minimal response to hormones • Ciliary muscle of eye, large airways of lung Single-Unit Smooth Muscle • Visceral (function not anatomy) • Network of closely apposed cells acting as a single unit • Direct stimulation of only a few • Multiple adherence points (desmosomes) • Linked electrically by gap junctions Single-Unit Smooth Muscle • Respond to • Neural signals • Hormones • Mechanical stretch • Local “pacemaker” potentials • Muscles of uterus, intestinal tract, bile duct, small blood vessels Innervation • Three types • Extrinsic: both sympathetic and parasympathetic • Intrinsic: short neurons forming plexuses (networks) with tissue • Afferent sensory: autonomic reflexesa Innervation • No neuromuscular junction • Branching of fibres with “varicosities” that contains vesicles with neurotransmitter (both acetylcholine and nor- epinephrine) • Neurotransmitter is released into interstitial fluid and then diffuses • Potential for both sympathetic and parasympathetic input • Modulatory rather than inducing Non-neural activation • Hormones can open and/or close ion channels changing membrane potential • Chemical stimuli can cause release of Ca++ from SR without a change in membrane potential • Other influences • Decreased oxygen, pH, body temperature Ca++ regulation of smooth muscle contraction • Ca++ regulates cross bridge formation and thus cycling • BUT different from skeletal muscle • Control of Ca++ levels • Influence on cross bridge formation (myosin) Control of cytosolic Ca++Ca++ and the cross bridge • Smooth muscle lacks troponin • Cross bridge binding modulated by Ca++ dependent phosphorylation of myosin Ca++ and the cross bridge Contraction of Cardiac and Smooth Muscle Dr Babatunde Ayodele awodeleb@unimelb.edu.au VETS30015 / VETS90121","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
