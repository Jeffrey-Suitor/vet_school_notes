Physical barriers • Skin barrier & mucous membranes • Normal bacterial flora 2. Innate: non-specific immunity • Circulating messengers (complement, cytokines, etc) • Phagocytes & Inflammation 3. Adaptive – specific immunity • Target specific defence against microbial antigens Antigen recognition – innate → adaptive immune system • Antigen presenting cells Concept of “self” & “non-self” • Innate system relies on a broad defence against “non-self” invaders • BUT – it is energetically expensive & the innate system can be easily avoided by clever rapidly evolving pathogens • Protective surfaces e.g. capsules made of slime • Chemical mimicry pretending to be “host” • Ability to survive intracellularly Leukocytes – white blood cells  Polymorphonuclear cells - involved in inflammation Non-discriminating self destructing suicide missions Release damaging enzymes that destroy invaders  APCs, macrophages & dendritic cells Phagocytose, process & present Ag to T cells  Lymphocytes T cells - killers/helpers (T cell receptors on cell surface interact with antigen presented on another cell surface) B cells - produce soluble antibody which interacts with antigen NK-cells, seek & destroy tumour cells & virus-infected cells via receptor recognition Innate Features of Adaptive Immune Response • Adaptability • Recognition of novel antigens - emerging viruses have never been seen before! • Specificity • Recognition of self versus non-self – not just to avoid autoimmune disease • Diversity • Capacity to produce a large array of antibodies & T cell receptors - gene recombination • Memory • Secondary response to re-exposure (principles of vaccination) Antigens • What is an antigen? • A molecule that can be recognised by receptors on immune cells • Small chemical structures through to highly complex molecules • Recognition usually only small part of antigen = epitope • Not all antigens are immunogenic • Haptens (e.g. drugs) • Carbohydrates Cells of the Adaptive Immune System Adaptive immune responses are Ag specific & involve B & T cell responses • recognise specific Ag through cell surface receptors & need to be activated before they function as effector cells • need to be able to tell the difference between self & non-self Lymphocytes patrol the body through lymph, blood & tissues T cells T helper cells (TH) orchestrate the response with cytokines T cytotoxic cells (TC) kill pathogen-infected cells or cancer cells “Cell mediated immunity” B cells produce antibodies (Ag-specific) “Humoral immunity” Lymphocyte - development T cell precursors come from the bone marrow and develop in the THYMUS T cells only develop in the thymus; nowhere else in the body. B cell precursors come from the bone marrow & develop in the Bursa of Fabricius (birds) & the Bone marrow in mammals MHC • Major histocompatibility complex • Structure used by cells to present antigens • Two classes: MHC-I and MHC-II • All nucleated cells express MHC-I • Antigen-presenting cells express MHC-II as well • MHC is specific to “self” lumenlearning.com Antigen processing Harryvan et al., 2022Harryvan et al., 2022open.edu T cell receptors • T cells only recognise peptide antigens when presented by MHC • T cell receptors bind antigen presented by MHC • Made of glycoprotein chains • α/β (most species) or γ/δ (ruminants) • Form a complex with CD3 • Additional proteins can be found in close association with TCRs • CD4 proteins are found on helper T cells • CD8 proteins are found on cytotoxic T cells • CD4 binds to MHC-II • CD8 binds to MHC-I T cell receptors – γ/δ • Most γ/δ T cell receptors don’t recognise MHC- antigen complexes • Most don’t have CD4 or CD8 • Activation of γ/δ T cells results in production of cytokines, lysis of infected cells, interaction with other cells T cell receptor (TCR) • Highly variable protein that recognises specific Ag presented to them • TCR is anchored into the cell by a conserved transmembrane domain complexed to CD3 protein • CD3 is required for cell surface expression of TCR and is involved in signal transduction • TCR:CD3 complex is present on all T- cells • TCR binding site is different for each Ag • APCs seek out a TCR that matches CD4 (or CD8) is also required to recognise the type of cell that is presenting Ag Why? TCR genesT cell development in thymus Delves & Roitt, NEJM, 2000 T cell receptors (α/β) • DON’T recognise own MHC with no antigen bound • This is considered “self” • DO recognise self MHC + bound antigen • = “altered self” • Occasionally non-peptide antigens can alter self MHC and elicit a T cell response • DO recognise foreign MHC Antigen presentation • Activated dendritic cells migrate to local draining lymph node • Process antigen • Present antigen to T cells • MHC molecules • Costimulatory molecules Delves & Roitt, NEJM, 2000 Interaction of T cell & APC Antigen presentation → T cell activation Delves & Roitt, NEJM, 2000 How do they decide? Principle cytokines of Th responses IL-2 B cell proliferation & differentiation IL-4 IgE production IL-5 IgA production Th2 IL-6 plasma cell differentiation IL-10 downregulates Th1 cytokines = antibody production IFNγ macrophages, NK cells, Th1 downregulates Th2 activation = Cytotoxic T cells & cell-mediated immunity B cells • Surface receptors & soluble receptors (= antibodies) • Act as APCs • Antigen binds to B cell receptor • Internalised, processed, and expressed on MHC-II • BCRs are specific for one particular type of antigen • Helper T cells co-stimulate B cells courses.lumenlearning.com Activated B cells • Clonal proliferation • Plasma cells (produce LOTS of antibodies) • Memory B cells courses.lumenlearning.com Antibodies • 5 classes of antibody (immunoglobulins) • IgG • IgA • IgM • IgE • IgD • All based on a Y-shaped molecule that matches a specific antigen • Secreted into body fluids, can also bind to surface receptors on certain cells to facilitate antigen recognition and/or presentation Antibody class switching by B cells Hey, look at this cool peptide I found! Yikes! What is that? Get rid of it. Where’s Bob? Hey Bob! If this ever shows up here again… Yes mam.
