How much energy is there is each kilogram of the feed we are purchasing if we dried it out until there was no water left in it This Photo by Unknown Author is licensed under CC BY-SA This Photo by Unknown Author is licensed under CC BY- SA Need to think about units we are using • Starting with a $/tonne & MJ/kgDM units • Need to end up with c/MJ • Step one • Convert $/tonne into cents/kg • There are 100 cents in a dollar and 1000 kilograms in a tonne (remember for those international students this is using the international metric system, NOT imperial) • E.g. if we started with $300/T (remembering this is still AS FED, not yet DM), then we end up with 30 c/kg • This is why in the example they use the multiplication factor of 10 Need to think about units we are using • Now we have our units in c/kg however it is still in units of as fed, not DM so must convert to kg of DM • Our cost per unit of DM will ALWAYS be more as we are removing water so the cost per unit of remaining DM INCREASES • So if the feed type is 90% DM (0.9 units per total are DM and 0.1 water) • To get our c/kgDM we divide our c/kg by 0.9 • E.g. 30 c/kg (As fed) = 30/0.9 c/kgDM = 300/9 c/kg DM = 33.33 c/kgDM Need to think about units we are using • Resuming from last slide ……..33.33 c/kgDM • The units we now have are c/kgDM but we need to end up with c/MJ (ie cost per MJ, in this case using cents as working in Australian currency) • If we have a feed test result this is expressed in MJ/kgDM, so if we divide the cost (c/kgDM) by energy (MJ/kgDM) we end up with cents/MJ (as you can see by the units cancelling out. • Many grains are somewhere between 10-12 MJ/kgDM – so lets use 11 MJ/kgDM • If we put that into our equation we get = 33.3/11 c/MJ = 3.03 c/MJ • Similar number to what you can see above General “rules of thumb” • Most feed cost will be less than 10c/MJ (see the next page for the sorts of common range) • Often higher moisture feeds look cheaper on a cost “as-fed” but when you factor in moisture and energy density they can end up being more expensive to purchase, particularly when cartage (cost to transport) is added as moving lots of water in the feed • Grain relatively simple to transport • Hay tends to be 80-90% DM, grain about 90%, silage highly variable “Normal” price range","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
