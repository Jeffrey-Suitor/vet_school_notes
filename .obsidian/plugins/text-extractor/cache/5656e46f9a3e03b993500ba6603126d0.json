Whilst there are different subject codes for the graduate (DVM) and undergraduate (BSc3) subjects, all lectures, practical classes and case studies are shared. Lectures will be pre-recorded and made available through the LMS to provide flexibility of study. Practical classes and case study sessions will be held on-campus with supporting online resources available through the LMS. Learning materials will be released weekly, to encourage deep learning and revision practices. This is the first of the ‘systems-based’ subjects that will bring together the disciplines of anatomy (structure and physical relationships at the micro and macro levels), physiology (function at the cellular, organ, system and animal levels), pathology (mechanisms of disease) and pharmacology (modifying function for the treatment of disease) in our study of the digestive system. By combining these disciplines into an integrated course, we hope you will be able to make links between the different disciplines which will greatly help in constructing a strong framework on which to build your knowledge and experience. The content of the Digestive System subject is arranged into themes such as ‘motility’ or ‘secretion and digestion’. This enables the course to address the function and dysfunction of this system, while maintaining a coherent narrative. This will also enable a routine to develop, which will culminate in a case study at the end of each theme. Case studies are an important addition to the lectures and practical exercises, and they have been devised to illustrate the importance of the acquired knowledge in the practice of veterinary medicine and to foster your clinical problem-solving skills. Each case is an example of a condition which commonly occurs in veterinary practice, and these exercises will help students to understand these situations from fundamental principles; and to apply their knowledge to explain the disease mechanisms and how they might be resolved. Students will work through these case studies in small groups, with a moderated summary session at the end. The major assessments in this subject include a 1-hour intra-semester test and a 2-hour end-of-semester examination. In addition, online quizzes related to each of the case studies will form part of the final mark. Students in the graduate cohort (VETS90120) will also be required to complete a group-work assignment towards the end of semester. Students are directed to the subject handbook for full details of assessments and mark allocations for each component. Your feedback on this subject is greatly appreciated (and will be sought during semester), and all staff will be happy to help steer you in the right direction if anything is unclear, in terms of either academic content or subject coordination. I hope that your studies are stimulating and rewarding.

L E C T U R E O V E R V I E W The digestive system includes the digestive tract and the accessory organs and glands. The function of the digestive system is to turn food into fuel by performing the following functions: securing, conducting and storing food; digestion and absorption of nutrients; and storage and disposal of wastes. The design of the digestive system in different species is adapted to suit different diets (e.g. carnivore, herbivore, omnivore). This lecture will provide an overview of the digestive system and abdominal cavity in animals. F U R T H E R R E A D I N G Singh: Dyce, Sack & Wensing’s Textbook of Veterinary Anatomy, 5th Ed.

She also was the Animal Welfare Officer at Macquarie University for several years. Since coming to Melbourne Veterinary School, Chris has taught first to third year veterinary students in a wide range of subjects, predominantly within the disciplines of veterinary anatomy and physiology. cmmurray@unimelb.edu.au I N T E N D E D L E A R N I N G O U T C O M E S At the end of this lecture, you should be able to: - Describe the general structure of a tooth and explain how the different tissues contribute to tooth function. - Compare the development and general structure of brachydont and hypsodont teeth. - Relate the different embryonic cell types to the dental structures they form. K E Y W O R D S Teeth, enamel, dentine, cementum, periodontal ligament, pulp cavity, gingiva, alveolar bone, vestibular, labial, buccal, lingual, palatine and occlusal surfaces, brachydont tooth, hypsodont tooth, deciduous teeth, dental lamina, tooth bud, enamel organ, dental papilla, dental sac, odontoblast, ameloblast, cementoblast, osteoblast. L E C T U R E O V E R V I E W Structure of a simple tooth The general structure of teeth will be explained using a simple brachydont (short-crowned) tooth as an example. The crown is the part of the tooth covered by enamel, and the root is embedded in the tooth socket in the jaw (alveolar) bone. Teeth are comprised of three different types of mineralized tissue, the shiny white enamel, and the dentine and cementum, which are both slightly yellowish. The dentine forms the framework of the tooth and is found in both the crown and the root, surrounding the central pulp cavity. The cementum surrounds the dentine of the root and may also contribute to the bulk of the crown in hypsodont (high crowned) teeth. The periodontal ligament originates in the alveolar bone and inserts in the cementum, holding the tooth in place in the socket. The structure of hypsodont teeth will be compared to that of the brachydont. Tooth development In many animals, a temporary set of teeth develops first, and is then replaced by a permanent set. Teeth develop from oral epithelium (ectoderm) and neural crest-derived mesenchyme, which go on to form an enamel organ. The ectoderm gives rise to the enamel-forming cells, which remain on the outside of the tooth until they are worn off following eruption. The cementum and dentine are produced by mesenchyme- derived cells. The permanent tooth develops in the space vacated by the temporary tooth and exerts pressure on it, causing it to be shed. Brachydont teeth have a short period of growth and eruption and the root forms during eruption. Hypsodont teeth have a prolonged period of growth and eruption, and the root starts to develop at some period after eruption has commenced.

K E Y W O R D S Teeth; carnivore; herbivore; omnivore; incisors; canines; premolars; molars; cheek teeth; dental pad; dental formula; diastema; brachydont; hypsodont; occlusion; infundibulum; dentition; ageing. L E C T U R E O V E R V I E W Arrangement of teeth The shape of teeth varies with the position in the oral cavity, and teeth are named according to their position in the oral cavity. In general, the most rostrally located teeth (incisors and canines) are used for cutting and tearing food, while the more caudally located teeth (premolars and molars) are used for grinding or crushing food. Species differences Different species have varying numbers of the different types of teeth. The teeth in carnivores are brachydont teeth, whereas the teeth in herbivores such as horses and ruminants are mainly hypsodont (high- crowned) teeth. Hypsodont teeth erupt continuously, and therefore the enamel extends below the gingival margin, and is surrounded by cementum, which wears off slowly after eruption. The enamel wears off the occlusal surface of the tooth soon after eruption, thus exposed dentine is visible on this surface. Use of dentition for age estimation The time of eruption and a variety of structural features of the different teeth in both the temporary and permanent sets of teeth can be used to estimate the age of animals, with levels of accuracy varying between species. The accuracy of age estimation also depends on the breed of animal, its individual genetics, whether there is malocclusion, and dietary, behavioural and environmental factors.

K E Y W O R D S Oral cavity; vestibule; tongue; root, body, apex, frenulum, papillae, taste buds; prehension; mastication; swallowing; deglutition; palate; pharynx. L E C T U R E O V E R V I E W The roof of the oral cavity is formed by the hard and soft palate, the walls are formed by the cheeks and lips, and the floor is formed by soft tissue extending between the two sides of the mandible. The tongue rests on the floor of the oral cavity. All of these structures, as well as the dental arcades, function in concert to bring food into the oral cavity, to prepare it for swallowing and to participate in the first stages of swallowing. The hard palate is constructed from bone covered by mucosa. The lips surround the opening of the oral cavity and are continuous with the cheeks caudally. Both of these structures are composed of three layers, the outer layer being skin, the middle layer containing skeletal muscle, tendon and glands, and the layer facing the oral cavity consisting of mucosa. The tongue is composed primarily of skeletal muscle with glands and adipose tissue scattered among the muscle bundles. The dorsal surface is covered in papillae, which assist in directing food towards the pharynx, and some of which contain taste buds, the structures responsible for the sense of taste. The pharynx is the passage caudal to the oral and nasal cavities that is common to both the digestive and respiratory tracts. The skeletal muscles in its walls act in a coordinated manner to propel food from the oral cavity into the oesophagus.

Simon then worked as a research scientist at the Heart and Lung Research Institute at the Ohio State University Medical Center, Columbus, Ohio. He then returned to the Royal Veterinary College as a lecturer and moved to the University of Melbourne in 2007. He is currently Professor of Pre-clinical Veterinary Sciences, and conducts research on inflammatory diseases, pharmacology and endocrinology in various species including horses. bais@unimelb.edu.au I N T E N D E D L E A R N I N G O U T C O M E S At the end of this lecture, you should be able to: - Utilise your knowledge of the structure and location of the salivary glands in different species, in order to relate this to differences in diet and feeding. - Explain the process of bolus formation and swallowing, in order to relate the structural features of the tongue and pharynx to their function. - Apply your knowledge of the structure of the oesophagus and its relationships to other anatomical structures, in order to understand the potential physical and functional mechanisms by which obstruction may occur. K E Y W O R D S Oral cavity; salivary glands; oesophagus; mediastinum; neck; smooth muscle; skeletal muscle. L E C T U R E O V E R V I E W When food is introduced into the oral cavity, it is moistened with the secretions of the salivary glands. The major salivary glands in most domestic species are the parotid, mandibular and sublingual glands; the carnivores have an additional salivary gland, the zygomatic gland. Most of these glands convey their secretions to the oral cavity through a single primary duct. The secretory cells within salivary glands are arranged in acini, and can be either mucous-secreting or serous-secreting cells. The acini release their contents into a branching duct system, which conveys the secretions to the primary duct. In preparation for swallowing (deglutition), the moistened bolus of food is shaped by the movement of the tongue, then moved into the pharynx where it initiates a series of reflex muscle actions, causing the pharynx to move rostrally to engulf the bolus and push it into the oesophagus; here, peristaltic contractions are initiated, resulting in the bolus being conveyed to the stomach. The oesophagus is a muscular tube that runs from the pharynx to the stomach. It is found in close proximity to the trachea within the neck, and within the mediastinum within the thorax; it penetrates the diaphragm before joining the stomach within the abdomen. The oesophagus is lined with a mucosa, which includes a muscle layer and is surrounded by the submucosa, which contains glands. An external muscle layer surrounds the submucosa; this layer is composed of skeletal muscle at the cranial end, and in most species changes to smooth muscle at the caudal end. A connective tissue layer surrounds the muscle layer.

K E Y W O R D S Stomach; reticulum; rumen; omasum; abomasum; digestion. L E C T U R E O V E R V I E W The compound stomach functions to act as a fermentation chamber where fodder (composed of complex carbohydrates) is broken down into useable metabolites by symbiotic micro-organisms. It has four compartments, the relative sizes of which vary with age, in correlation with the nature of the food ingested. It occupies almost three quarters of the abdominal cavity and fills almost the entire left half of the abdominal cavity in the adult animal, extending from diaphragm to pelvic inlet and extending considerably over the median plane into the right half. It has four compartments which are grouped into the fore-stomach (or proventriculus) which is non- glandular, and consists of the rumen, reticulum and omasum; and the abomasum which is glandular. At birth, the abomasum is the largest compartment, but in the adult, the rumen is the largest. In cattle, the reticulum is the smallest compartment and Lies on the left side cranial to the rumen. The omasum lies on the right side of the rumen and reticulum, and in sheep, this is the smallest compartment. The abomasums is somewhat elongated and lies on the abdominal floor. Reticulum The reticulum (or ‘honeycomb’) is the most cranial compartment and lies on the left side. It serves as a sieve for coarse material, also absorbs fatty acids, water, salts, etc. It passes coarse material back to the rumen and fine material to the omasum by very forceful contractions. Rumen The rumen fills the left half of the abdominal cavity and contributes ~80% of total stomach capacity. It is divided into several compartments (sacs) by thickened pillars, corresponding to grooves on the outside. Ruminal contractions mix the ingesta and furthers the process of microbial fermentation releasing volatile fatty acids and gases. The lining of the rumen is also adapted to absorb volatile fatty acids, sodium and water. Papillae increase the surface area for absorption and assist mixing of ingesta. Omasum The omasum (the ‘butcher's bible’) contributes ~ 7-8% of total stomach capacity in the cow (smallest compartment in the sheep and goat), and lies mainly on the right of the midline. It lies between the rumen and reticulum on its left and the liver and body wall on its right. It is spherical to ellipsoidal in shape, but somewhat compressed, having greater and lesser curvatures. The omasum serves as a two-stage pump for transfer of ingesta from the reticulum to the abomasum and as a sieve for quality control separation. It also absorbs fatty acids, water, salts. Abomasum The abomasum is the 'true stomach', equivalent to the simple stomach of carnivores. It is rich in glands that produce digestive enzymes and HCl for digestion and mucus for protection. It is a somewhat elongated sac which chiefly lies on the abdominal floor - insinuated between the ventral sac of the rumen and the reticulum; the caudal end is flexed around the lower pole of the omasum. The abomasum also contributes ~ 7-8 % of total stomach capacity in the cow. F U R T H E R R E A D I N G Ashdown and Done: Color Atlas of Veterinary Anatomy: The Ruminants, 1984.

K E Y W O R D S Simple stomach; abomasum; fundus; body; pylorus; glandular regions; saccus caecus; comparative anatomy. L E C T U R E O V E R V I E W The simple stomach is the dilated part of the alimentary canal in which the processes of digestion are initiated. The structure of the stomach is determined by the feeding habits of the species: Horses, pigs and carnivores have a simple stomach, while ruminants have a compound stomach – the abomasum has a similar glandular structure and fulfils a similar role to the simple stomach. The stomach is a musculo-glandular organ interposed between the oesophagus and the small intestine. It consists of two distinct parts that converge and join at a ventral angle forming a C- or J-shape. The cardiac, fundic and body regions form the larger part - into which the oesophagus opens. This part of the stomach lies mainly to the left of the median plane, well forward under cover of the ribs and is in direct contact with the liver and diaphragm. It is relatively distensible. The pyloric region is the second part which is narrower, has thicker walls and is more constant in appearance. It passes to the right to continue into the duodenum at the pylorus. The stomach has two surfaces - both variably convex. The cranial or parietal surface is mainly in contact with the liver and diaphragm, and the caudal or visceral surface is in contact with the intestinal mass, the left kidney, the pancreas and the greater omentum. The stomach also has two curvatures (the borders between the two surfaces). Both run between the cardiac and pyloric openings. The lesser curvature is very short and sharply concave and is connected with the liver by the lesser omentum. The greater curvature is very long and convex and gives attachment to the greater omentum and the gastrosplenic ligament which attaches the spleen with the stomach. The two extremities of the stomach are the cardia (the oesophageal orifice into the stomach) and the pylorus (the opening of the stomach into the intestine). The stomach wall As with most other parts of the gastrointestinal tract, there are 4 main layers in the wall of the stomach: The mucosa forms gastric pits -lined by mucus secreting simple columnar surface epithelium. The function of the mucus is to protect the gastric mucosa. Tubular glands are present in the laminar propria. These extend to the muscularis mucosa and open into the base of the gastric pits. The submucosa contains no glands, but is rich in blood vessels and nerves, and contains mainly collagen fibres. The muscularis externa is very thick and churning of the ingesta enables further mechanical breakdown. It has 3 incomplete layers of smooth muscle: the inner layer which is oblique; the middle circular layer (which helps form the thick ring of the pyloric sphincter and the weaker ring of the cardiac sphincter) and the thinner outer longitudinal layer. The outer serosa consists of a serous membrane (simple squamous epithelium) which reduces friction, overlying connective tissue conducting nerves and blood vessels. Glandular regions within the stomach Within the stomach there are different zones or regions, based on the distribution of the types of glands in the walls. In the dog (and human) these glandular regions correspond to the major parts of the stomach, i.e. cardiac glands in the cardia, fundic glands in the fundus and body, and pyloric glands in the pylorus. However, in the other species, the glandular regions to not correlate with the gross anatomical regions of the stomach, which can be confusing. The true fundic glands secrete HCl and pepsin, as well as mucus, and this glandular region is generally the largest. The cardiac and pyloric regions are mainly mucus secreting. Comparative aspects In the dog, the stomach is C-shaped and is relatively large (2.25 litres in an average sized dog). When empty the stomach does not contact the abdominal wall and lies cranial to the last rib, but when distended it may extend caudally quite considerably. There are three distinct regions to the mucosa. Cardiac glands are found in a very narrow pale zone around the cardiac opening and scattered along the lesser curvature. The fundic gland region has a thick reddish-brown mucosa which lines about 2/3 of the stomach and has prominent longitudinally orientated rugae. The pyloric mucosa is thin and pale. The greater omentum is very extensive and may contain much fat. When the abdomen is opened ventrally it covers the entire intestinal mass, extending from the greater curvature of the stomach to the pelvic inlet. In the horse, the stomach is relatively small (5-15 litres) and has a sharply curved J-shape. The fundus is extensive, forming a large non-glandular sac (the saccus caecus). Internally, the saccus caecus is separated from the rest of the stomach by a mucosal fold-the margo plicatus, which marks the boundary between the non-glandular and glandular regions of the gastric mucosa. The pig has a relatively large stomach (approximately 9 litres), with an irregular J-shape. It has a large region of cardiac glands in the fundus. Ruminants have a complex stomach that was covered in a separate lecture. Birds have two distinct parts to the stomach, separated by a constriction (the isthmus). The first part is the proventriculus, a small cranial glandular stomach which is elongated and spindle-shaped. Ducts of the mucosal glands open on visible papilla which project into the lumen. The second part is the Gizzard (Ventriculus) which is the large caudal muscular stomach. F U R T H E R R E A D I N G Dyce, Sack and Wensing: Textbook of Veterinary Anatomy 3rd edition 2002.

K E Y W O R D S Clinical examination; clinical investigation; history taking; auscultation; palpation; endoscopy. L E C T U R E O V E R V I E W This lecture will introduce the principles of how a veterinarian can assess the digestive system in animals, when in reality the entire system remains hidden and difficult to evaluate. Issues with the digestive system can present as an emergency - for example, gastric dilation-volvulus (GDV) in a dog or ruminal tympany (‘bloat’) in a cow. In those situations, triage and stabilisation will occur before history taking, and diagnostics are generally done to assist in prognostication rather than diagnosis. However, in less acute cases, taking a detailed history will save time in the long run. A holistic (whole animal/whole herd) approach should be taken, since many different factors and systems may be interrelated. A thorough history should include questions about appetite; how well the animal can eat; diet (full); any episodes of vomiting/description of the vomiting and how long after eating it may occur; nature of the faeces; precipitating events; weight loss and many other questions. The digestive system is always assessed during a routine clinical examination of any animal. This includes examining the mouth, the throat, and palpating the abdomen for any signs of pain, bloating, etc. A stethoscope can be used (auscultation) over the abdomen to listen for sounds associated with intestinal motility (particularly in large animals). A knowledge of anatomy helps to identify structures that are being palpated or auscultated. More detailed investigations may then be carried out if a problem with this system is suspected. This can include endoscopy and other types of imaging such as radiography and ultrasound (imaging will be covered in another lecture). Examination of the faeces can provide a lot of information but is often overperformed in small animal practice. Blood samples can also be useful to rule out non-GI disease, and if necessary, tissue samples (biopsies) can be obtained from different parts of the gastrointestinal tract.

L E C T U R E O V E R V I E W This seminar will provide an introduction to the different technologies available for imaging the internal organs of the body, including those of the gastrointestinal tract. Each different method provides different information and levels of detail which can be useful when trying to diagnose or assess a particular disease or condition. Understanding some of the principles of how these techniques work will help in the understanding and interpretation of the images that they provide. The normal radiographic anatomy of the abdomen of the dog is discussed followed by some principles of interpretation of the radiographic appearance of the gastrointestinal tract. This is followed by a number of case examples of gastrointestinal obstruction to illustrate these principles. O P T I O N A L F U R T H E R R E A D I N G Thrall, D.E. (ed), (2017).

L E C T U R E O V E R V I E W The digestive system performs four basic functions- motility, secretion, digestion and absorption of ingested food. Of these secretion and motility exhibit the highest degree of control. Motility of the gut is provided for by layers of smooth muscle- circular and longitudinal, along the length of the gut. The sequenced contraction and relaxation of these muscle layers allow for mixing of ingested food with secretions, mechanical breakdown of food particles, propulsion of food along the gut tube and periodic release of chyme through sphincters from one region of the gut to the next. This lecture will describe the range of motility forms characteristic of gut smooth muscle and introduce you to the control mechanisms that modulate motility, particularly in the stomach.

L E C T U R E O V E R V I E W The digestive system of ruminants is much more complicated than that of monogastric animals. For effective fermentation of ingesta by the microbiota residing in the reticulo-rumen, this environment needs to be carefully controlled regarding acid-base homeostasis and motility patterns. Some of the main functions of the ruminant forestomachs are: - To serve as a fermentation chamber for microbes. - To mix and separate ingesta appropriately. - To allow built-up gas to escape. - To buffer the rumen content to maintain an optimal pH for the microbes while conserving water and electrolytes.

K E Y W O R D S Vomiting centre, vomitus, brain stem, chemoreceptor trigger zone, CTZ, vestibular apparatus, semi-circular canals, emetic, anti-emetic, apomorphine, metoclopramide, cisapride, phenothiazine, anti histamine, H1 receptor, dopamine receptor antagonist, neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist, 5HT3 antagonist, acepromazine, maropitant, ondansetron, prokinetic, anti-spasmodic. L E C T U R E O V E R V I E W The mechanics of vomiting Vomiting is a complex reflex event, coordinated by the vomiting centre in the brain stem (medulla). It is not reverse peristalsis; the stomach, oesophagus, gastro-oesophageal sphincter and pyloric sphincter are all relaxed. Not all mammals can vomit: dogs and cats vomit readily. Once stimulated, the vomiting reflex involves a predictable sequence of mechanical events. Preceding vomiting there is salivation, increased heart rate, and pallor. Vomiting commences with deep inspiration and closure of glottis, that is followed by contraction of the diaphragm and abdominal muscles leading to increased intra-abdominal pressure. With concomitant relaxation of the stomach and its sphincters, gastric content is forced into the oesophagus. Increased pressure leads to relaxation of the pharyngo-oesophageal sphincter and passage of vomitus into the mouth. Regurgitation is different from vomiting Regurgitation involves a reverse peristaltic wave in the oesophagus. It generally occurs shortly after eating and is not preceded by salivation, increased HR and so on. In contrast to vomitus, regurgitated material is generally undigested or poorly digested. Control mechanisms in the vomiting reflex There are many and diverse stimuli to the vomiting reflex- unpleasant sights and smells, processed at the level of the cerebral cortex may stimulate vomiting. Abnormal motion, sensed by the semicircular canals of the vestibular apparatus, as well as a range of stimuli from visceral organs- distension, inflammation, intense pain, can all stimulate vomiting. In addition, blood borne toxins and chemicals can directly stimulate vomiting. The vomiting centre in the brain stem (medulla) receives afferent input from cortical, visceral and vestibular receptors. In addition, in close proximity to and in communication with the vomiting centre in the medulla is a discrete area known as the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ). In this region, the normally tight blood-brain barrier is more permeable, allowing contact between blood borne toxins and neurons. Blood borne toxins thereby stimulate vomiting via activation of the CTZ and hence the vomiting centre. A number of different neurotransmitters are involved in the different elements of the vomiting reflex. In the vomiting centre, the predominant neuroreceptors are for acetylcholine, neurokinin1 and 5 hydroxytryptamine (5HT), in the vestibular apparatus for histamine. In the CTZ dopamine, 5HT and neurokinin 1 receptors are important and, in the periphery, 5HT and acetylcholine. Why is this important? Because when the neurotransmitters and their receptors in the vomiting pathway are identified, it is possible to develop drugs that target and block these receptors, thereby blocking the vomiting reflex. Drugs that stimulate vomiting - centrally and peripherally acting emetics Sometimes veterinarians actually want to stimulate vomiting- for example when the stomach needs to be emptied of toxic or irritant ingesta. Two types of drugs are used for this purpose- peripherally acting compounds, such as washing soda, that stimulate the vomiting reflex via receptors and afferent pathways from the gastric mucosa, and centrally acting compounds such as apomorphine, that is absorbed from the stomach to the bloodstream, and stimulates the CTZ and hence the vomiting centre. Classes of drugs that inhibit vomiting - anti-emetics A class of drugs is a group of drugs that shares a common mechanism of action. Because there are multiple causes (stimuli) for vomiting, involving various neural pathways and neurotransmitters and receptors, a number of different classes of drugs are used to treat vomiting. It is important to recognize too, that when anti-emetics are used, they are generally being used to alleviate a sign of disease - not the disease itself. (for example, if vomiting is due to increased blood urea levels as a consequence of kidney disease, the anti- emetic has no effect on blood urea levels or on the progress of the renal disease. The following are the classes of anti-emetics most commonly used in veterinary medicine; a prototypical drug in each class has been included. Neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists for example maropitant are the newest class of veterinary anti-emetic. These drugs target NK1 receptors in both the CTZ and the vomiting centre and are effective antiemetics. Dopamine receptor antagonists for example metoclopramide, domperidone. These drugs act by antagonizing dopamine at the CTZ. Metoclopramide also promotes the release of and increases the sensitivity of visceral smooth muscle to acetyl choline, which results in: increased tone of the lower oesophageal sphincter, increased strength of oesophageal contraction, increased gastric antral contraction, relaxation of pylorus, increased smooth muscle contraction in the duodenum. Often nausea and vomiting are related to delayed gastric emptying. These actions increase gastric emptying and small intestinal activity without altering gastric or intestinal secretion or absorption. Significant side effects relate to dopamine’s other roles as a CNS neurotransmitter, and range from hyperactivity to depression, disorientation and frenzy. 5HT3 antagonists for example ondansetron (three times daily); dolasetron (once daily). These are very effective antiemetics, that have been used extensively in cancer chemotherapy in humans. They are thought to have a central action on the CTZ, probably also act through antagonism of peripheral 5HT-3 receptors. Anti-histamines for example promethazine. These are effective in treatment of vomiting associated with middle ear infections or motion sickness (there are histamine receptors in semicircular canals). Their most significant side effect is sedation (which is not necessarily a bad thing for a car sick puppy!) Phenothiazines for example prochlorperazine. We will meet this class of drugs again as pre-anaesthetic sedatives. These drugs act at multiple receptors, blocking the CTZ at low doses, through dopamine receptors, and the vomiting centre at higher doses, through muscarinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptors. They also block peripheral dopamine receptors in the stomach. AS they have a number of side effects, there are better classes of drugs available. Drugs that modify gastrointestinal motility Prokinetics, that normalize gastrointestinal activity and antispasmodics that reduce activity are sometimes used in the treatment of vomiting. Drugs that are prokinetics include metoclopramide (discussed above) and cisapride, that increase levels of the parasympathetic neurotransmitter acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft, and myenteric plexus. Most antispasmodics are antagonists of acetylcholine at parasympathetic receptors, for example hyoscine. Anticholinergics reduce gastrointestinal motility, which can act as stimulus to further vomiting. Overuse can result in atony and predispose to absorption of endotoxins through damaged mucosa. Whilst they are included in a number of formulations for treatment of vomiting, their use is not recommended. F U R T H E R R E A D I N G Sherwood, L.

Hydrochloric acid secretion by gastric parietal cells is used to demonstrate the hierarchy of control of secretory activity. The importance of this understanding is highlighted by introduction to the mechanisms of action of classes of drugs that can be used to modify acid release. The exocrine secretory activity of the liver and pancreas are introduced, including the role of enterogastrones in the regulation of these secretions.

K E Y W O R D S Gastric gland, gastric pit, surface mucous cell, mucous neck cell, chief cell, parietal cell, enterochromaffin cell, hydrochloric acid, pepsinogen, pepsin, secretory canaliculus, gastrin, histamine, acetylcholine, prostaglandin, vagus nerve, carbonic anhydrase, hydrochloric acid, proton pump, H/K ATPase, cephalic phase, gastric phase, intestinal phase, H2 receptor antagonist, proton pump inhibitor, cytoprotective drug, cimetidine, omeprazole, misoprostol, sucralfate, antacid. L E C T U R E O V E R V I E W Digestive secretions of the stomach Along with mechanical digestion that is the consequence of gastric motility, chemical digestion continues in the stomach as a result of secretions from gastric mucosal cells. The stomach wall is comprised of the same tissue layers found throughout the gut tube - mucosa, submucosa, circular and longitudinal muscle layers and peritoneum. With the exception of the region around the cardiac sphincter of some species, the gastric mucosa is a single layer of cells thick, that is folded into glands that empty their secretions into gastric pits and from there into the lumen of the stomach. Secretion of digestive enzymes is from specialized cells located in the fundic region of the mucosa: pepsinogen secreted by chief cells, that is cleaved to the active protease pepsin in the presence of hydrochloric acid (HCl), HCl secreted from gastric parietal cells, and mucus released from both surface mucous and mucous neck cells. The structure of each of these cell types reflects its specialized function. The gastric parietal cell: a cell specialised for secretion of HCl The gastric parietal cell is a wonderful example of a cell specialized for its function- the secretion of HCl by active transport against a concentration gradient. The active transport mechanism- a H/K ATPase, is located membrane bound on the luminal border of the cell. The surface area of this luminal border is greatly expanded by a deep infolding of the surface to form an intracellular secretory canaliculus. During periods of active secretion this surface is further expanded by translocation of intra cellular tubules and vesicles to form microvilli on the canalicular border. The energy for active transport and also for membrane cycling is provided by large numbers of mitochondria in parietal cells. Generation of hydrogen ions in parietal cells is catalysed by the enzyme carbonic anhydrase. Chloride secretion is also active, by a separate membrane bound mechanism. Chloride ions enter the cell in exchange for bicarbonate ions generated in the carbonic anhydrase reaction. Control mechanisms in HCl secretion The secretion of HCl is a rate-limiting step in gastric digestion- without HCl pepsinogen remains inactive. As a consequence, understanding the factors controlling acid release is fundamental to managing gastric digestion, and in particular to managing medical situations such as gastric ulceration. Control of acid release from parietal cells can be considered at a macro or at a cellular level. Acid release is observed in response to the sight or smell of a meal, and when food is chewed in the mouth even before swallowing. This is the so-called cephalic phase of secretion and involves extrinsic nerves. Acetylcholine released from vagal efferents binds to muscarinic receptors on the basal surface of parietal cells. Vagal efferents also stimulate the release of the enterogastrone gastrin from G cells in the pylorus, that circulates to the fundic region and binds to its receptor on parietal cells. Finally, vagal stimulation of enterochromaffin cells, stimulates local release of histamine that binds to H2 histamine receptors on parietal cells in close proximity, stimulating acid release. Once food enters the stomach (in the gastric phase of secretion), mechano- and chemo- receptors (sensitive in particular to intra gastric protein levels) activate local intrinsic neural and neuro-endocrine pathways to further augment both acid and pepsinogen release. Binding of neurotransmitter or hormone to the parietal cell activates an intracellular pathway involving the second messenger cAMP. Acid secretion is inhibited by prostaglandins binding to cell surface PG receptors, that results in decreased intracellular cAMP levels. Just as gastric motility is inhibited by the presence of increasingly fatty, acidic or hyperosmotic chyme in the duodenum, gastric secretion is similarly inhibited. This is the intestinal phase of secretion and involves local intrinsic (gastro-enteric) nerve reflexes, enterogastrones- secretin, CCK and GIP. Anti-ulcer drugs: drugs used to inhibit gastric acid secretion Understanding the cellular mechanism of acid secretion provides receptor targets for inhibiting acid release. Classes of drugs used to reduce acid secretion include: Histamine (H2) receptor antagonists: for example, cimetidine, ranitidine. As the histamine receptor is the dominant receptor on parietal cells, these drugs can reduce acid release by up to 70%. Whilst they are relatively free of side effects, they share metabolic pathways with several other classes of drugs, so drug interactions can be important. Proton pump inhibitors: for example, omeprazole. These drugs are very potent inhibitors of acid release because they irreversibly bind and block the active transport protein. Their effect persists even after drug is detectable in the blood stream. They are used in the treatment of unresponsive ulcer. Anti-ulcer drugs: cytoprotective drugs Prostaglandin analogues: for example, misoprostol. These drugs mimic the effect of endogenous prostaglandins (PG’s) to decrease acid release. In addition, PG’s protect against gastric ulceration and aid ulcer repair by increasing mucosal blood flow, stimulating mucosal cell turnover, and stimulating mucus secretion. Their role in the maintenance of the gastric mucosa will be discussed further in the upcoming lecture on ‘mucosal barrier’. Sucralfate has sometimes been described as an ulcer bandaid- it dissociates in the gastric lumen to octosulfate, that forms a sticky sucrose gel, and aluminium hydroxide, that neutralizes gastric acid. Anti-ulcer drugs: antacids Act to neutralise hydrochloric acid, bind bile acids and decrease pepsin activity. They provide only symptomatic relief. Antacids generally contain AlOH, CaCO3, Mg(OH)2, NaHCO3. Magnesium salts lead to increase bowel motility, aluminium salts to a decrease in bowel activity. As a consequence, antacids often include both Mg and Al salts. Antacids are used only in human medicine. F U R T H E R R E A D I N G Sherwood, L.

L E C T U R E O V E R V I E W Chyme that enters the duodenum is subjected to further chemical digestion due to the activity of secretions of the pancreas, the liver and intestinal mucosal cells. The role of the pancreas in digestion The pancreas functions both as an exocrine gland-secreting enzymes and electrolytes that enter the intestinal lumen through the pancreatic duct, and as an endocrine gland-releasing the hormones insulin and glucagon from islets of Langerhans into the blood stream. The exocrine secretions of the pancreas include the proteolytic enzymes trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen and pro-carboxypeptidase, as well as pancreatic amylase, lipase and bicarbonate. Proteolytic enzymes are secreted in an inactive form and are auto-catalytically converted to their active form on entry to the small intestine- trypsinogen by activity of enterokinase secreted by cells of the intestinal mucosa, and the other cells by the activity of trypsin. These enzymes catalyse the breakdown of proteins to amino acids and small peptide chains. Complex intracellular mechanisms stabilize proteolytic enzymes within the pancreatic acinar cell to prevent auto-digestion of the pancreas. The pancreas is the only site of production of lipase, the enzyme that can accomplish fat digestion, by hydrolysing dietary triglycerides to the absorbable units of monoglycerides and free fatty acids. As a consequence, excessive fat in the faeces (steatorrhea) may be result from insufficient pancreatic secretion. Chyme entering the duodenum is highly acidic. Electrolytes (bicarbonate) secreted by ductal pancreatic cells, in a process that is catalysed by carbonic anhydrase, buffers this acidic chyme, to prevent damage to mucosal cells and to provide a pH optimal for the activity of pancreatic enzymes. Ductal secretion of an electrolyte rich solution contributes greatly to the volume of pancreatic fluid. Control of pancreatic secretion Pancreatic secretion is subject to a similar hierarchy of control mechanisms as exists for gastric secretion. Pancreatic secretion can be observed in all phases of digestion- cephalic, gastric and intestinal- and both neural and neuro-endocrine pathways are involved. The cephalic phase- in response to the sight, smell or ingestion of food is mediated via vagal stimulation of acinar and ductal cells. The presence of food in the stomach, and particularly gastric distension and the presence of protein, increase pancreatic via two pathways- a vago-vagal reflex, and via release of gastrin that is a potent stimulus to pancreatic secretion. The intestinal phase of pancreatic secretion is the most significant, stimulated by the presence of chyme in the duodenum. An acidic (or fat laden) chyme stimulates release of the enterogastrone secretin from duodenal S cells, and subsequent secretion of bicarbonate rich aqueous fluid from ductal cells. A protein or fat rich chyme stimulates release of cholecystokinin (CCK) and subsequent release of enzyme containing zymogen granules from acinar cells with little change in fluid volume. Bile secretion and the biliary tree The liver is a complex metabolic organ with a multiplicity of functions. Amongst these is the synthesis and secretion of bile salts, that aid in the emulsification and subsequent digestion of fats by pancreatic lipase. Bile salts are formed in hepatocytes by conjugation of cholesterol with amino acids. The steroid backbone of the bile acid is lipophilic; the amino acid conjugate is hydrophilic. Conjugated bile salts are thus able to function as detergents and serve to keep fats in solution in an aqueous environment and hence accessible to lipase. Bile salts aggregate spontaneously with fats to form micelles. Bile salts are secreted across the lateral border of hepatocytes into the bile canaliculus, and then through a network of ductules and ducts to the bile duct and to storage in the gall bladder. The gall bladder stores and concentrates bile but has no secretory role. Control mechanisms in secretion of bile The vagus nerve plays a minor part in control of bile secretion. The enterogastrones secretin and CCK are significant regulators of bile secretion and release. As it does with pancreatic NaHCO3 secretion, secretin stimulates an increased aqueous alkaline bile secretion by duct cells without a corresponding increase in bile salt secretion, i.e. secretin stimulated release of alkaline biliary secretion helps to neutralise gastric acid entering duodenum. The presence of fat in duodenal chyme stimulates release of CCK, which as its name suggests, stimulates contraction of the gall bladder and delivery of bile to the duodenum. Secretion of bile by hepatocytes is also regulated by chemical means, the so called ‘bile salt dependent bile flow’. During a meal, bile is emptied from the gall bladder to duodenum, bile salts participate in fat digestion, then pass to the ileum where they are reabsorbed and returned by entero-hepatic circulation to the hepatocytes, where they serve to increase bile secretion. As bile is secreted and reabsorbed, its secretion is increased. Between meals, when bile salts are being stored in the gall bladder, secretion is low. Entero- hepatic circulation allows for a very high degree of conservation of bile salts (up to 98%), with the remainder synthesized de novo. F U R T H E R R E A D I N G Sherwood, L.

L E C T U R E O V E R V I E W In this lecture, we will overview various diseases of the stomach and abomasum. The stomach and abomasum can become enlarged with feed (impaction) or water, food and gas (dilation). The stomach and abomasum can also become displaced (GDV in dogs and abomasal displacement). Gastric ulceration is a common finding in a variety of species and can lead to pain, poor performance (horses) or production (livestock) and secondary infection. Gastritis is inflammation of the stomach wall and occurs due to a variety of reasons including Clostridium septicum infections in cattle, many chemicals, non- steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and uraemia. Unlike in humans, there is no proven association between Helicobacter spp infection and ulceration in domestic animals. Gastric/abomasal parasites are common in horses, cattle, sheep and goats and can cause death in severe cases. Adenocarcinomas, squamous cell carcinomas and lymphomas are the most important gastric neoplasms and will be discussed in this lecture. F U R T H E R R E A D I N G Zachary, J.

L E C T U R E O V E R V I E W The exocrine pancreas plays a pivotal role in the digestion of food via the secretion of digestive enzymes/pro- enzymes and bicarbonate. Several defence mechanisms exist to prevent auto-digestion of this organ and of other host tissues. However, in certain circumstances, these defences can go awry, be circumvented or become exhausted, resulting in pancreatic necrosis (necrotising pancreatitis). Although injury to the exocrine pancreas may provoke clinical signs during the acute phase, the large functional reserve of this organ allows many disease processes to smoulder subclinically for prolonged periods. When clinical signs do emerge, they may largely reflect maldigestion (for example, weight loss despite a normal to increased or depraved appetite, gross abnormalities in the volume, colour and/or odour of the faeces or in the frequency of defaecation), jaundice (due to obstruction of the distal biliary tree) or metabolic disturbances arising from concurrent destruction of the endocrine components of the pancreas (diabetes mellitus). We will review the important disorders of the exocrine pancreas in domestic animals, including developmental anomalies, diffuse and focal atrophy, pancreatic necrosis, pancreatitis, pancreatic duct obstruction, nodular hyperplasia and neoplasia.

L E C T U R E O V E R V I E W What comprises the peritoneal cavity and retroperitoneum? What are the routes by which peritoneal fluid drains? How does the peritoneum respond to injury? What are the important disease processes that affect the peritoneal cavity and retroperitoneum of the domestic animals? What are the causes and potential consequences of these diseases? In health, the peritoneal (or abdominal) cavity is lined by a monolayer of mesothelial cells and contains a small volume of transudative fluid that is constantly recycled via lymphatic drainage. Several conditions may result in distension of the cavity by excess non-inflammatory oedema fluid, because of obstruction of drainage pathways and/or over-production of fluid. Injury to the lining mesothelium permits exudation of fibrin and leukocytes into the peritoneal cavity. If the inflammatory response is severe or persistent, it may promote the formation of permanent fibrous tissue adhesions between cavity structures. Adhesions can be advantageous in that they may help to wall off sites of inflammation within the cavity to prevent systemic spread of infectious agents but they can also compromise the function of the various visceral organs that are suspended within the cavity. In this lecture, we will review the important disease processes that involve the peritoneal cavity of domestic animals. These disorders include developmental and acquired lesions that permit internal or external herniation of cavity viscera, abnormal cavity contents (including foreign bodies, parasites, gastrointestinal contents, oedema fluid, blood, urine, chyle and bile), inflammation of the cavity (peritonitis) and its causes and consequences, and neoplasia. The retroperitoneum lies immediately external to the peritoneal cavity and in health contains loose fibrofatty connective tissues and organs such as the kidneys and adrenal glands. The most significant processes that can affect the retroperitoneum of domestic animals and that will be reviewed in the lecture are retroperitoneal fat necrosis, inflammation (retroperitonitis), accumulation of haemorrhage or other fluids, and neoplasia..

This involves understanding not just the processes involved in digestion of each of the major food stuffs, but also the structural adaptations of the different regions of the intestines that enable absorption to occur, in a range of species, including the role of microbial fermentation in these processes. We will consider the mechanisms of diarrhoea – that may occur as a consequence of perturbation of absorptive processes, or of intestinal secretory processes.

L E C T U R E O V E R V I E W The small intestine is the site where digestion of foodstuffs is completed, and absorption occurs. The greatest proportion of absorption takes place in the duodenum- but ileal absorption is important particularly for absorption of bile salts, fat soluble vitamins and vitamin B12. There are specific absorption mechanisms for each of the major nutrients as well as for sodium. Clinically significant secretion of electrolytes also occurs in the small intestine. The small and large intestines are differentiated structurally for their roles in digestion and absorption. Surface area is increased by the presence of folding (plicae and rugae), by the villus structure of the small intestinal mucosa and by the presence of microvilli on mucosal absorptive cells. The microvillus brush border contains enzymes that catalyse the final breakdown of carbohydrates and peptides to absorbable units, and also the transport pumps required for absorption. Intestinal secretion of chloride Chloride is secreted by intestinal crypt cells, by means of an active transport process. The movement of chloride into the lumen is accompanied by sodium and water. The secretion of chloride is mediated by second messenger systems involving cAMP and cGMP. Changes in these second messenger levels induced by microbial pathogens can result in secretory diarrhoea. Digestion and absorption of protein The breakdown products of pancreatic proteases are amino acids and small peptides. These are split by dipeptidases bound to the brush border membrane, and amino acids are absorbed by a carrier mediated Na dependent secondary active transport process in the apical cell membrane.; the carrier is specific for each amino acid. Absorbed amino acids then move by diffusion down a concentration gradient into the blood stream. Digestion and absorption of carbohydrate Dietary carbohydrate is presented for absorption as the disaccharides: maltose, sucrose and lactose. Disaccharidases located in brush border facilitate their breakdown to monosaccharides. Glucose and galactose both move through the apical membrane via secondary active transport: a carrier on the luminal surface simultaneously transfers glucose against a concentration gradient, and Na+ down a concentration gradient from the lumen to the cell. The Na concentration gradient is established by basolateral Na+/K+ pump; no energy is directly used to move glucose up a concentration gradient. Cotransport is driven by Na+ gradient established by the Na/K pump. Glucose and galactose diffuse down a concentration gradient through the basolateral surface of cell; fructose is absorbed into the blood purely by facilitated diffusion. Digestion and absorption of fat Because of the insolubility of fat in water, fat must undergo physical and chemical transformation to facilitate absorption. Dietary fat in the form of triglycerides is emulsified by the detergent action of bile salts to form micelles, with increased surface area for pancreatic lipase activity. Lipase hydrolyses triglycerides to monoglycerides and free fatty acids, and the water insoluble products are carried in the interior of water- soluble micelles to the brush border. Monoglycerides and free fatty acids leave the micelle and passively diffuse through the luminal membrane. Within the cell, triglycerides are resynthesised, aggregate and are coated with lipoprotein to form water soluble chylomicrons that are extruded from the basal cell surface by exocytosis. Chylomicrons unable to enter blood capillaries, so enter lymphatic lacteals. Following feeding, lacteals are visible due to the “milky” character of the lymph within them. Absorption of sodium Absorption of sodium, that drives also the absorption of water from the gut, occurs in a number of ways. When the electrochemical gradient is favourable, sodium will diffuse down a concentration gradient into the cell. At other times, absorption of sodium is driven by a Na/K active transport pump on the basolateral cell membrane, that creates a favourable diffusion gradient across the apical cell membrane into the cell. In addition, Na entry to the cell occurs in a cotransport mechanism linked to both glucose and amino acid absorption, by means of the sodium linked glucose transport (SLGT) protein. This latter mechanism forms the basis of oral rehydration therapy with isotonic glucose solutions, as this cotransport may continue to function in intestinal disease states that cause diarrhoea. Absorption in the large intestine With the exception of the hind-gut fermenters, that are the topic of a later lecture, the largest proportion of water, and almost all nutrients are absorbed from the small bowel. Approximately 12% of water absorption occurs in the colon, but the efficiency of absorption is much higher here; (90% compared to 50% in the small intestine). In addition, water absorption from the large bowel is regulated by the presence of aldosterone responsive Na channels in the basal membrane of colonic mucosal cells.

The small intestine As in the dog and cat, the small intestines in the other domestic species consist of the duodenum, jejunum and ileum. Apart from the great length of the small intestine in the horse, ruminants and pig, there are some differences in the ducts opening on the major and minor duodenal papillae (either one or two pancreatic ducts). The large Intestine While in the dog, the large intestine is short and unspecialised (a simple tube only slightly larger in diameter than the small intestine), in the ruminants, horse and pig it is greatly enlarged and coiled. This reflects the contribution of bacterial digestion in the hindgut and the absorption of nutrients in the form of volatile fatty acids.

K E Y W O R D S Embryology, coelom, gut tube, foregut, midgut, hindgut, mouth, palate, tongue, cloaca, gastrointestinal development. L E C T U R E O V E R V I E W Early formation of the gut tube Formation of the primitive gut is initiated by the establishment of the endodermal layer of the blastocyst. With folding of the body wall into a cylindrical shape, the primitive gut within the embryo is formed into a tube with three parts: foregut, midgut, hindgut and the part of the primitive gut that remains outside the embryonic body wall, the yolk sac. Derivatives of the fore-gut include part of the mouth, the pharynx; the oesophagus, the stomach, the liver and the pancreas, the thyroid, the parathyroid and the thymus glands, the trachea and the lungs. Derivatives of the mid-gut include the major part of the small intestine. Derivatives of the hind-gut include the large intestine and the cloaca. Development of the mouth The Stomodaeum is a midline depression on the ventral surface of the head that is created by the cranial and lateral body folding. It subsequently enlarges into a definitive oro-nasal cavity. The oral plate (or pharyngeal membrane) is formed by the fusion of the ectoderm of the stomodaeum and the endoderm of the fore-gut. The oral plate subsequently breaks down and the cranial opening of the digestive tube is established. After head folding, fleshy mesenchymal swellings, the branchial arches, develop on either side of the developing oro-nasal cavity. The derivatives of the branchial arches contribute to formation of the head and neck. For example, the first branchial arch divides into the left and right maxillary processes and mandibular processes which elongate to form the jaws and mouth. Development of the palate At an early stage of development the oral and nasal cavities are confluent, but palate development subsequently separates the oral and nasal cavities. The palate derives from three parts: 1. Left palatine process 2. Right palatine process 3. Medial palatine process (= inter-maxillary process) These three processes fuse together to separate the oral and nasal cavities. This hard palate extends caudally as the soft palate that separates the rostral pharynx into the nasopharynx (dorsal) and oropharynx (ventral). Early in development, the most cranial part of the fore-gut becomes very broad and flattens dorso-ventrally. This expanded fore-gut gives rise to a series of pouches - pharyngeal pouches - which extend laterally. These pharyngeal pouches provide numerous contributions to various organs and tissues, many of which are not associated with the digestive system. These include the eustachian tubes (auditory tube, the fossae of the tonsils and covering epithelium and cells of the parathyroid, thymus and thyroid glands. Development of the tongue The tongue arises as a protrusion from the floor of the pharynx into the primitive mouth. Tongue formation begins as 4 distinct mesenchymal swellings: - A median tongue swelling; - Two distal tongue swellings; - A proximal tongue swelling. The median and distal tongue swellings will form the body of the tongue, while the proximal tongue swelling will form the root of the tongue. The epithelium covering the surface of the tongue is completely renewed every 7-10 days. Formation of the oesophagus The fore-gut narrows to form the oesophagus and elongation of the oesophagus occurs during growth of the cervical and thoracic regions of the body. The epithelial lining of the oesophagus and any associated mucosal glands develop from the endoderm of the primitive fore-gut. The connective tissue and muscle layer of the oesophagus are derived from accumulating mesenchymal cells partially derived from the splanchnic mesoderm of the primitive gut. Formation of the stomach The stomach arises as a spindle-shaped swelling of the fore-gut located in midline. A dorsal mesentery (the dorsal mesogastrium) develops on the dorsal surface and the ventral mesentery (the ventral mesogastrium) develops on the ventral surface. It has a cranial opening - the cardia and a caudal opening - the pylorus. The developing stomach moves caudally and shifts away from the midline. Thus, the stomach rotates towards the left pulling with it the dorsal mesentery and leading to the formation of the greater omentum. There is species-specific differential enlargement and reshaping of the stomach, e.g. the ruminant stomach. Formation of the small and large intestines Initially, the primitive gut is straight with dorsal and ventral mesenteries. Later the ventral mesentery breaks down. The gut grows faster than the body so a hairpin-shaped loop is formed. The remnant of the yolk sac (the yolk-stalk) is at the tip of the loop. Rapid development of the liver forces the loop of gut into the umbilical stalk - this is physiological herniation. Later the intestines return to the abdomen and move into their final position. Further changes involve rotation of the loop and extensive coiling of the cranial arm of the loop to form the duodenum, jejunum and most of the ileum. The gut loop from the yolk-stalk to the proctodaeum contributes to the terminal part of the ileum, caecum, colon, rectum and anal canal. The caecum becomes established as a definite pouch-like diverticulum of the digestive tube caudal to the yolk stalk. Species-specific changes occur in the developing caecum and colon to account for the specific layouts discussed in anatomy. Cloaca and proctadeum The caudal portion of the primitive gut expands to form the blind cavity of the cloaca. The invagination of ectoderm beneath the tail forms the proctadeum. This boundary between the endoderm and the ectoderm forms the cloacal membrane, which degenerates resulting in the anal opening.

L E C T U R E O V E R V I E W How is it that the gastric mucosa can secrete acid at a pH of less than 2, and proteolytic enzymes that digest ingested meat and other proteins, yet the single celled mucosal lining of the stomach is not digested by its own secretions? What determines why a nutrient is absorbed, yet a potentially harmful molecule is not? How can drugs be designed to enhance or to limit their absorption from the gastrointestinal tract? How are bacteria and other microorganisms prevented from entering the mucosa? Understanding the answers to these questions involves understanding the biological principles that underpin the concept of the gastrointestinal barrier. Disruption of the gastrointestinal barrier is a significant contributor to disease processes. It allows intestinal microorganisms to cause systemic disease, and in other situations, systemic disease can result in disruption of the mucosal barrier, that further compromises the patient. Structural aspects of the mucosal barrier The intrinsic mucosal barrier is composed of the epithelial cells and the tight junctions that hold them together. Once toxins or microorganisms cross this epithelial surface, they have relatively unimpeded access to the circulation. The integrity of tight junctions is therefore critical and understanding factors that modulate their permeability is important. Epithelial cells themselves differ in their permeability to ions and hence their resistance to damage from luminal content. Parietal cells in the stomach for example, are less permeable to protons than intestinal epithelial cells and hence less prone to acid damage than intestinal cells. Secretions and the mucosal barrier The surface of the gastrointestinal tract is coated with mucus that contributes to the barrier in a number of ways. Mucus reduces shearing forces on the epithelial surface, helps bind and aggregate bacteria, preventing their colonisation, and impairs absorption of some water-soluble molecules. A range of mucins are produced in different parts of the digestive tract. Some are membrane bound and recognise and repel bacteria, others exert their protective effects by creating a physical barrier. Some are involved in cell signalling, leading to secretion of bactericidal compounds by surface epithelial cells. Epithelial cells in both the stomach and intestines also secrete bicarbonate ions, that help to create a neutral pH at the apical cell surface, despite widely fluctuating pH in the gastrointestinal lumen. Cell turnover and the mucosal barrier An important functional component of the intrinsic mucosal barrier is provided by the constant turnover and replenishment of epithelial cells in the stomach and intestines. Integrity of the mucosal barrier relies on a balance between stem cell proliferation, differentiation and epithelial cell death. In the intestine, this dynamic cell population is described as the crypt-villus unit. Epithelial cells migrate from the base of a crypt to the tip of a villus where they are extruded, over a period of three to five days. As they do so, they differentiate from a stem cell to a secretory cell and finally to an absorptive epithelial cell. A number of disease states are characterised by changes in the balance of cell types in the crypt-villus unit as a result of changes to proliferation, differentiation or the rate of cell death. Villus atrophy is one outcome of such a perturbation. In the stomach, stem cells that give rise to the various cell types are located in the mid gland region and migrate as they differentiate in both directions in the gland. Mucosal blood flow Another important component of the mucosal barrier is provided by the mucosal blood supply. The submucosa is richly supplied with blood vessels, that in addition to providing nutrients and oxygen to mucosal cells, allow for rapid removal of hydrogen ions that diffuse from the lumen. Any disease state that causes significant reduction in mucosal blood flow will result in damage to the mucosal barrier. Gastric ulceration associated with haemorhagic shock occurs by this mechanism. Control mechanisms and the mucosal barrier Each of the functional aspects of the mucosal barrier that have been described above is subject to regulation- some that are better understood than others. Important and well described regulators of a number of these functions are the prostaglandins (PGs)- particularly PGE and prostacyclin, that are synthesized and released locally in the gastrointestinal mucosa. PGs increase mucus and bicarbonate secretion, stimulate cell proliferation and increase mucosal blood flow. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAID’s) such as aspirin increase the risk of gastric ulceration because they impair prostaglandin synthesis. Other chemicals known to be involved in maintenance of the mucosal barrier are epidermal growth factor (EGF) secreted in saliva and by duodenal glands and transforming growth factor alpha (TGF- alpha), that is secreted by gastric epithelial cells. Both bind to a common receptor to increase epithelial cell proliferation, and also increase gastric mucus secretion and decrease acid secretion. How do drugs cross the mucosal barrier? There are a number of potential routes for drugs to cross the mucosal barrier. How they cross and the rate of absorption depends on characteristics of the drug and also the functional state of the mucosa. A reduction in mucosal surface area (for example as a result of villus atrophy,) will reduce absorption of drugs as well as nutrients, and this needs to be taken into account if drugs are administered orally. Equally, disease states that increase permeability of the mucosal barrier can result in absorption of drugs not normally absorbed, or in increased rate of absorption of a drug, beyond what is expected. Many drugs are absorbed in a concentration dependent manner; (the greater the concentration the greater the absorption of drug). For these drugs diluting the drug in food may result in reduced absorption of drug. The concentration gradient of the drug across the mucosal surface also depends on mucosal blood flow. Local variations in blood flow as a result of exercise or feeding can change the concentration gradient for absorption of drugs- so can be important when determining timing of drug administration. Solubility of the drug is also important. For amphoteric drugs, that are weak acids or bases, their solubility varies depending on the pH of the luminal content- which of course may vary along the gut length and also with feeding status. To be absorbed drugs must cross both the apical and basal epithelial cell surface. Lipid soluble drugs cross these membranes readily and so can establish a large concentration gradient between the lipid membrane and the cytosol. Some water-soluble drugs move readily across the membrane by bulk flow, with water absorbed in active co-transport mechanisms. Some very small drugs may also move by diffusion through tight junctions. F U R T H E R R E A D I N G Blikslager AT, Roberts MC: Mechanisms of intestinal mucosal repair.

L E C T U R E O V E R V I E W Saliva, gastric fluid, bile, pancreatic and intestinal fluids are secreted into the digestive tract. The relative volume of these fluids as well as their composition varies considerably between the different species according to diet and type of digestive tract. Much of these fluid secretions are reabsorbed at a more distal part of the digestive tract, exactly where depends on gastrointestinal tract anatomy and physiology. Obstruction to fluid movement along the digestive tract, either physical or functional, can have significant consequences for the fluid balance and circulation of the animal. This lecture looks at common clinical situations in different species where normal fluid movement in the gastrointestinal tract is disturbed. We will examine the clinical consequences for the animal when this occurs, including fluid, electrolyte and acid-base disturbances. We will also look at the different ways of assessing the gastrointestinal tract, particularly in the horse.
