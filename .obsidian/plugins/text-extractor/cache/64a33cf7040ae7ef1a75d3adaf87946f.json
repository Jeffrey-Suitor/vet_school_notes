May be longer for stud animals • Droughts, floods etc may make movement further • Technology allows for greater movement with increased bidding e.g. Auctionsplus interface with live sale Sheep production systems • Self replacing wool (54%) • Self replacing meat (25%) • Wether based (6%) • Crossbred (3%) • Trading and other (12%) Data from ABAREs with local knowledge https://www.woolwise.com/wp- content/uploads/2017/07/WOOL-300-300-14-T-01.pdf https://www.woolwise.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/WOOL-300-300-14-T-01.pdf EMI – the Eastern Market IndicatorMajor shifts identified by early 2000s • 1. Shift to lower micron flocks, particularly in Merino production • 2. Shift to overall higher bodyweight ewes • 3. Reduction in overall wether numbers being retained past 2 years of age • 4. Increased joining of older and cull (for type) Merino ewes to terminal sires such as Dorsets, BLs, WS – maybe finished on farm or sold as store lambs eg moving from sheep/wheat zone to high rainfall zone commonly https://www.agriculture.gov.au/sites/default/files/sitecollectiondocuments/animal-plant/animal-health/livestock-movement/sheep-movement-ead.pdf Micron price differential https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/5435 47/Paper-1-global-supply-and-demand.pdfhttps://www.awex.com.au/media/1041/wool-buying-in-australia-2013.pdf http://data.daff.gov.au/data/warehouse/pe_abarebrs99001007/PC12614.pdf Change in national flock structure – WA example https://www.agric.wa.gov.au/sheep/western-australian-sheep- and-wool-industries Why increase bodyweight in Merino? https://www.woolwise.com/wp- content/uploads/2017/07/WOOL-412-512-12-T-12.pdf","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
