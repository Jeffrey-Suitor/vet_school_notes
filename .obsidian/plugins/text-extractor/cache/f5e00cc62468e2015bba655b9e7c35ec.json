Selective Barrier • Regulates flow of material into and out of the cell 2. Organization • Form compartments (e.g. organelles) • Help maintain separate and distinct molecular environments 3. Transport • Contain specific molecular pumps and channels for transporting solutes 4. Controlling information flow • Specific receptors for external signalling • Generate chemical & electrical signals 5. Cell-cell interactions • Cell recognition • Cell adhesion 6. Reactions • Enzyme activity Cell membrane structure and composition The cell membrane is composed of a phospholipid bilayer that regulates entry and exit of fluid and molecules • Plasma membrane Structure: o Phospholipid bilayer o Proteins o Integral, surface o Cholesterol o Carbohydrates linked to proteins & lipids • Fluid mosaic model: o Membrane proteins move freely in the lipid layer o Ever-changing pattern of proteins o Cytoskeleton can restrict proteins to specific areas of cell membrane Phospholipid bilayer • Lipid bilayer • Phospholipids ❖ Have a hydrophilic • Polar ‘head group’ • Attracted to water ❖ Hydrophobic • Non polar ‘tail’ region • Fatty acids • Cholesterol molecules are tucked between phospholipid molecles – support membrane fluidity Hydrophobic (lipid soluble) Diffuses quickly Hydrophilic (lipid insoluble) Hydrophilic (polar) substances in membrane are sparingly soluble 1. Nonpolar molecules Pass freely e.g., fatty acids, steroid hormones, CO2, & O2 (act as nonpolar – because they are linear) 2. Small uncharged polar molecules Pass freely but more slowly than nonpolar molecules e.g., H2O 3. Large polar molecules & ions Don’t pass freely (e.g. glucose, Na+) 4. Macromolecules Don’t pass (e.g. proteins, polysaccharides, nucleic acids) Lipid bilayer permeability: determined by size & solubility in lipid Plasma Membrane Proteins: integral and peripheral Integral membrane protein: permanently attached to the cell membrane lipid bilayer - Some span the entire membrane (e.g. ion channels, hormone receptors -Others are embedded (e.g. enzymes) Peripherally associated membrane proteins: not permanently attached to the cell membrane lipid bilayer - Non-covalently bound, often attached to integral proteins (e.g. regulatory proteins, transporter proteins, enzymes) A: peripheral protein, B: α helix, single span C: α helix, triple span, D:embedded, but not spanning membrane,E: Linked to phospholipid by an oligosaccharide,F: Direct link to a fatty acid Boron & Boulpaep, 2012 Functions of the membrane proteins Intercellular joining - Cell adhesion molecules - Form loops or hooks to grip other cells Transport: - Form hydrophilic channels across lipid bilayer - Highly selective channels Signal transduction - Receptor proteins that receive external signals Enzymatic activity: - Control chemical reactions inside or outside cell Attachment - Proteins that connect the cell to extracellular matrix Cell recognition: - Facilitate cell-to-cell interactions - Cell’s ability to recognise ‘self’ Membrane channels • The protein transmembrane channels that permit simple diffusion: - pores and channels (gated) • Types of gated ion channels • voltage-gated, e.g. Na+ or K+ (specific channel for each) • Chemical or ligand-gated, e.g. acetylcholine • mechanically-gated, e.g. sound waves in inner ear open ion channels Guyton and Hall, 2011 Boron & Boulpaep, 2012 Transport across biological membranes 1. Simple diffusion Down a concentration or electrical gradient ❖ Through membrane (lipid-soluble molecules) ❖ Through pores – integral cell membrane protein, e.g. aquaporin for water ❖ Through protein channels – selectively permeable, may be gated, eg ion channels 2. Facilitated Diffusion • Down a concentration or electrical gradient ❖ Carrier mediated - need integral membrane protein ❖ Transporter is specific for the molecule ❖ Rate limited by binding and conformational change in carrier protein; eg glucose, amino acids 3. Active transport • Up a concentration or electrical gradient ❖ Carrier mediated and energy dependent Guyton and Hall, 2011 • Use of a carrier protein to facilitate transfer across membrane, down a concentration gradient • Molecule binds to a receptor within the carrier protein • Binding triggers a shape (conformation) change of carrier protein allowing entry to the opposite side of the membrane • Release returns carrier protein's shape to the original or unoccupied state. • Carrier proteins demonstrate specificity • Transport rate is limited by concentration of molecule and number of channels (receptors become saturated) • Examples: glucose (in most cells) and amino acids Guyton and Hall, 2011 Comparison of simple and facilitated diffusion Hall, 2016 Facilitated diffusion Cells to Systems Lecture 9: Transport of molecules across cell membranes Video 2 Dr Laura Dooley Senior Lecturer laura.dooley@unimelb.edu.au VETS30015 / VETS90121 Transport across biological membranes 1.

Active transport • Up a concentration or electrical gradient ❖ Carrier mediated and energy dependent Guyton and Hall, 2011 Active transport - Active transport mechanisms are often called ‘pumps’ - Primary active transport directly uses chemical energy (primarily ATP) to move molecules - Secondary active transport uses an electrochemical gradient – generated by active transport – as an energy source to move molecules against their gradient. It does not directly require a chemical source of energy such as ATP. Guyton and Hall, 2011 - Use of protein carrier to carry a specific substance - Transported against concentration or electrochemical gradient - Requires expenditure of energy (in the form of ATP) to drive carrier Primary active transport example: Na+-K+ ATPase pump • Membrane of all cells contains an active Na+-K+ ATPase pump • Functions to concentrate Na+ in the ECF and K+ in the ICF • 3 receptors for Na+ inside cell & 2 receptors for K+ outside cell • ATPase activated when ions bind → cleaves 1 molecule of ATP Guyton and Hall, 2011 • Liberated energy causes conformational change in carrier which flips the ions across the membrane Primary active transport example: Na+-K+ ATPase pump Guyton and Hall, 2011 Functions: 1. Establishes Na+ and K+ concentration gradients across the cell membrane → interior of cell negative with respect to exterior → critical for propagation of action potentials in nerves and for muscle contraction 2. Regulates cell volume by controlling solute concentrations– minimise osmotic effects that would induce swelling/shrinking of cell 3. Energy used also indirectly serves as energy source for cotransport of glucose and amino acids through secondary active transport • Similar primary active transport pumps for Ca2+ and H+ Secondary active transport Secondary active transport uses an electrochemical gradient – generated by active transport – as an energy source to move molecules against their gradient. For example: • Intestinal and kidney cells actively transport glucose and amino acids up their concentration gradients • Co-transport carriers have two binding sites – one for Na+ an the other for the nutrient molecule (e.g. glucose) • When both glucose and Na+ are bound to the carrier, it changes shape and opens to the inside of the cell – both Na+ and glucose are released into the ICF • Released Na+ is quickly pumped out again by the Na+-K+ ATPase pump, to keep the intracellular Na+ low (maintaining Na+ concentration gradient across membrane) Cunningham, 2010 Vesicular transport • Some large molecules/multimolecular materials are too large for channels and carriers • They are transferred in a membrane-enclosed vesicle → vesicular transport • Vesicular transport requires energy → active transport mechanism • Transport into the cell = endocytosis; Transport out of cell = exocytosis • Three forms of endocytosis: 1. pinocytosis – non-selective uptake of ECF 2. receptor-mediated endocytosis (large molecule) 3. phagocytosis (multimolecular particles) Marieb, 2012 1. Vesicle buds off from plasma membrane 2. Vesicle transported intact, releasing contents to exterior by exocytosis or fuses with a lysosome 3. Membrane components recycled to the plasma membrane Membrane potential • All cell membranes have a membrane potential due to difference in the relative number of cations and anions in the ICF and ECF • The ions primarily responsible are Na+, K+, and negatively charged intracellular proteins • Negatively charged intracellular proteins cannot permeate the membrane → unbalanced distribution → ICF is more negative than ECF • 20% of membrane potential is generated by the Na+-K+ ATPase pump (active transport mechanism) • The rest is generated through the passive diffusion of Na+ and K+ down concentration gradients Ion concentrations and electrochemical gradients • For K+, the concentration gradient would tend to move the ion out of the cell, but the electrical gradient would tend to move K+ into the cell →K+ diffuses out of the cell down its concentration gradient until electrical forces prevent further net diffusion • More diffusion (leak) channels for K+ than Na+ → so more K+ leaves than Na+ enters • Negative ions that can’t easily diffuse remain in ICF → Results in a net negative charge within the cell Membrane potential At resting membrane potential: • Passive leaks of Na+ and K+ down their electrochemical gradients • This is counterbalanced by the Na+-K+ ATPase pump • No net movement of Na+ and K+ → membrane potential remains constant • Movement of fluid and solutes from blood to interstitial fluid (L8)  Diffusion, osmosis  Bulk flow and Starling’ Forces • Movement of fluid and solutes from interstitial fluid into cells (L9)  Diffusion  Facilitated Diffusion  Active Transport  Co-transport Transport of fluid and molecules across cell membranes","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
