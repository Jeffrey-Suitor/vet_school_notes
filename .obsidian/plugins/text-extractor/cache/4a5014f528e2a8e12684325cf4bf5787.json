Lecture Overview To facilitate meaningful, unambiguous communication, anatomy has standardised names or all the structures of the body, and many parts within these structures, as well as description terms for position and relationships. In this lecture, we introduce the basic terminology and look at how anatomical names and terms are used to communicate complex 3D positions and relationships in a clear and precise manner.
