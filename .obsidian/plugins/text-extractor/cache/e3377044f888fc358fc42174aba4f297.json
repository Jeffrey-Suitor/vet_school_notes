Do not jump ahead. • This file gives you detailed instructions for completing each activity. Ask your tutor if you have any questions. • For some activities, you will be asked to record your answers to the questions by typing them into this file. You should save this PDF file each time you complete one of these questions, to make sure that your work does not get lost. Guidelines for effective Group work Your group will work at its best when everyone feels comfortable and “safe” to contribute to discussion. Here are a few suggestions that might help promote a safe and effective group work environment: • Ensure that you all know one another’s names- and that you use them during your conversations. • Effective listening is a key to effective group work. Respectful listening enhances a positive group dynamic, and creates a space where it is safe for all to contribute. • Taking time to discuss is really important- discussing involves questioning and responding, reviewing and reflecting, sharing understanding. This is where deep learning occurs. It can often be greatly enhanced by visualisation- by sharing of ideas, summaries and processes on your white board and by collective rephrasing and reframing of ideas. • Sharing of tasks and responsibilities is also important in group work. Perhaps make a roster and each week have a different group member take responsibility for the keyboard, and for completing your interactive pdf. 3 instructions Enter each group member’s name, Iand email address below.

GROUP NUMBER Name Email Address 4 introduction You are a new graduate vet working in a mixed practice in central Victoria. At eight p.m., just as you finish the evening consultations, a very distressed Mrs. Matthews arrives at the clinic. “It’s Jack,” she says, “he was fine this afternoon and ate all his dinner a couple of hours ago, but now there’s something really wrong. First he was restless, then I couldn’t get him out of his bed and he wouldn’t even eat a piece of cheese. He’s trying to vomit and he looks really weak.” You walk with Mrs. Matthews to the car to help her bring Jack into the clinic. Jack lifts his head as you approach the car and struggles to his feet. Once out of the car, however, he collapses and requires a stretcher to transport him to the clinic. As you lift him onto the stretcher, you notice that his abdomen looks very tight and distended. QUESTION 1 • In the answer box on the next page, create a list of key information about Jack. Key information is all the information that may be relevant in assessing Jack’s current condition - this includes information about Jack (signalment), his present condition and anything relevant that his owners have told you in his history. • In your list of key information, underline all abnormalities. Summarise the abnormalities to create a shorter list that defines Jack’s main presenting problem(s). This is called a problem list. Write this problem list on your whiteboard. For instance “he looks really weak” and he “struggles to his feet” are abnormalities that essentially describe the same problem. • For each presenting problem, try to identify which body system(s) could be involved. For each body system identified, construct a list of different disease processes that could lead to the presenting problem. This is termed a differential diagnosis list. In constructing this differential diagnosis list you should provide the mechanism by which each differential diagnosis leads to the presenting problem. Use your whiteboard to develop flow charts that outline how each mechanism has led to the development of your identified problem(s). For example, you could be presented with a young dog that has diarrhoea. You identify that the digestive system could be involved and you postulate that one of the mechanisms that could lead to diarrhoea is malabsorption following the destruction of enterocytes by a parvo virus infection. 5 • What further information, which might be obtained from asking Mrs. Matthews further (history) questions, do you require to help you differentiate between the different mechanisms you have listed? Explain your reasoning. For instance in the case of the dog with diarrhoea described above you might ask the owner if the dog has been vaccinated against parvo virus. If the owner confirmed the dog was up to date with parvo virus immunization, you would then be able to delete parvo virus infection from your list of mechanisms. 6 history Mrs. Matthews tells you that Jack is 9 years old, and has been in very good health. He has no history of weight loss and no history of vomiting or diarrhoea. He has one meal a day, generally a bowl of dry food supplemented with some table scraps and he has a really good run after dinner each night. Today he had some chicken necks with his dry food at about 6.00pm and he had his normal evening run at 6.30pm. Mrs. Matthews tells you that she first noticed Jack was restless at 7:30pm. She let him outside because he looked as if he wanted to vomit. She saw him retching as if trying to vomit, but he only seemed to bring up froth. Since then he has become increasingly depressed and she thinks his stomach is getting bigger. He is immunized against parvo virus, hepatitis, distemper, bordetella and parainfluenza (C5 vaccination) annually and given Drontal Allwormer® (a tablet for the control of gastrointestinal worms) every three months. QUESTION 2 • How are you able to distinguish between vomiting and regurgitation? Are you able to make this distinction from Mrs. Matthews description? What additional diagnostic information might you be able to obtain by making this distinction? • In the box below, summarize the additional information obtained from the history. Identify any abnormalities. On your whiteboard, refine your problem list, your list of differential diagnoses and your flowcharts to include all new information that might contribute to the problem. • Looking at Jack’s main presenting problems, which differential diagnoses are now the most likely explanations for his present condition? 7 QUIZ 1 Click back to the LMS and attempt Quiz 1 before continuing. QUESTION 3 • What further information, which could be obtained by a physical examination of Jack, might enable you to distinguish between your differential diagnoses? • Explain how this information will help you to do this. 8 physical examination Tip: A major body systems assessment is a focused examination of the vital organ systems to detect life-threatening abnormalities. It consists of: Cardiovascular exam mucous membrane color, capillary refill time, heart rate, pulse quality and heart auscultation Respiratory exam respiratory rate, effort, pattern, auscultation, mucous membrane colour Neurologic exam gait, mentation Abdominal palpation Temperature Typically, the rest of the physical examination is performed after MBA assessment and stabilization Jack collapses in the consulting room and makes occasional unproductive retching attempts as you examine him. You notice that abdominal palpation elicits a pain response, particularly in the cranial abdomen and that the abdomen appears distended and tympanic. The senior veterinarian Leonie Paterson arrives and conducts a Major Body Systems Assessment (MBA) of Jack. A MBA is focused examination of the cardiovascular, respiratory and neurologic systems to detect abnormalities that are immediately life threatening. General observations Weak, collapsed, painful, drooling. Cardiovascular system Pale, tacky mucous membranes, capillary refill time 3s (1-1.5s), heart rate 165 (80 - 100), weak pulses, no heart murmur or arrhythmia. Respiratory system Tachypnoea, lungs clear on auscultation, rapid and shallow respiratory pattern Neurological status Unable to walk, depressed Abdominal palpation Abdomen is distended, tympanic and painful Temperature 36.8°C (normal 38.0 - 39.0 °C) Weight kg 31.0 9 QUESTION 4 • Are there any terms that you do not understand? Look these up in a veterinary dictionary and record them in the box below. • Summarize the abnormalities that you have obtained from the major body system assessment and integrate them into one problem to add to your problem list. Is this problem linked to Jack’s previously identified problems? • How would you refine your differential diagnoses, in the light of the findings from your physical examination? • What diagnostic tests might you undertake in order to help you reach definitive diagnosis? 10 investiGation Tip: The term “acute abdomen” is often used to describe patients with apparently acute abdominal pain. It may or may not be accompanied by vomiting or distension. Evaluation of patients with acute abdomen is always urgent, as they may have problems that require surgery on an emergency basis. With Leonie, you explain to Mrs. Matthews that you are suspicious of a problem within Jack’s abdomen and that an abdominal radiograph would help you to confirm your diagnosis. In addition you explain that your physical examination suggests that Jack is critically ill and you would like to perform some basic blood tests on Jack to give you further information on this. Mrs. Matthews consents to your request and a right lateral, plain abdominal radiograph of Jack is obtained, together with some blood. Normal right lateral abdominal radiograph (below) Jack’s right lateral abdominal radiograph (below) 11 Remember that a radiograph is an image created by the passage of X-rays through the body. Structures that are air-filled, such as the lungs, appear radiolucent (darker) on a radiograph, whereas structures that are mineralized, such as bone, will appear relatively radiopaque (lighter) on a radiograph. Structures of intermediate radiodensity, such as soft tissues, will appear as shades of grey on a radiograph. When looking at the radiographs attempt to visualize the normal anatomical relationships within the abdomen and how they might have changed in Jack’s case. QUESTION 5 • What information can you gain from the blood test? • Identify the following structures on the normal radiograph: lungs, ribs, heart, thoracic vertebrae, lumbar vertebrae, location of the stomach (How is the stomach orientated? How is this represented in a lateral radiograph?), location of the small intestines, colon (containing faecal material), liver, spleen, bladder 12 QUESTION 6 Compare the amount of gas present (darker areas) in the abdomen of the normal dog with Jack. Then refer to the radiograph of Jack to answer the following questions in the box below. • In which structure within the abdominal cavity is the gas most likely to be located? • The origin of the gas accumulation is not yet fully understood, but is believed to be caused by a combination of aerophagia and gases produced during bacterial fermentation. Briefly explain how these factors lead to gas accumulation. What is the normal mechanism for release of gas from this structure? • Which two other organ systems are affected by the organ distension detected on the radiograph? How does this explain Jack’s two main presenting problems (collapse and abdominal distension)? • Are you able to reach a definitive diagnosis from the radiograph? • What other structure within the abdominal cavity shares a common blood supply with the stomach and could also be compromised by this condition? 13 diaGnosis Leonie explains to Mrs. Matthews that Jack has a gastric dilation and volvulus (GDV) and is now critically ill. She explains that his stomach has rotated, blocking the escape of fluids and gastric contents, and that it is distending with gas that he is unable to release. She explains that this is creating a number of problems for Jack - the distended stomach is applying pressure to other organs within the abdomen including the great veins and that this is reducing venous return and hence cardiac output. “In addition”, she says, “the twist is also likely to compromise the blood supply to the stomach and deprived of its blood supply, the stomach wall may die.” “Is this really serious then?” asks Mrs. Matthews. “I’m afraid it is,” replies Leonie. Watch the movie below, which shows the stomach and spleen twisting, in order to understand this condition further. Jack’s night out Stomach twisting 14 QUESTION 7 • What treatment options are available for Jack? • If surgery is an option, what risks might be involved in anaesthetising a dog in Jack’s condition. How can you minimise these risks? • What might be the consequences of not treating Jack? • How would you explain Jack’s present condition and his prognosis to Mrs. Mathews? What recommendations and options would you give her? 15 treatment Leonie explains: “First of all we will need to stabilize him because he is going into (hypovolaemic) shock. Once he is stable he will need surgery to relieve the distension, return the stomach to its normal position and if necessary remove any segment of the stomach that appears to be dying.” Leonie goes on to explain that because of Jack’s critical condition there will be risks associated with the surgery, although stabilization prior to surgery will improve his current condition. She also mentions that without surgery Jack will die and discusses the option of euthanasia as an alternative to treatment. Mrs. Matthews decides to go ahead with treatment. Leonie reassures Mrs. Matthews that as she has presented Jack very promptly at the clinic, she has done all she can to maximise his chances of recovery. Mrs. Matthews signs the surgery consent forms and prepares to leave. Leonie lets her know that she’ll ring her as soon as surgery has finished. Jack is stabilized initially by the rapid administration of intravenous fluids. While this is occurring percutaneous trocharization of the stomach is undertaken with an 18g needle. A small amount of gas is released. Once stable, Jack is anaesthetized. Below is a record of the notes summarizing Jack’s surgery. A ventral midline laparotomy was performed. The stomach and spleen were rotated clockwise 270 degrees. The stomach was decompressed by further centesis prior to derotation of the stomach and spleen. A stomach tube was passed and left in situ during the procedure. The stomach wall was inspected – initial congestion resolved during the course of the surgery. The spleen was congested and enlarged. An incisional gastropexy was performed on the right abdominal wall. The abdomen was lavaged and suctioned prior to closure with a continuous suture of 3.5m PDS®. 2m Vicryl® subcutaneous sutures were placed and skin closure was completed with 2m Supramid® skin sutures. Overnight plan: monitor vital signs, periodic ECG to check for ventricular premature contractions, maintain on IV fluids, metoclopramide, methadone, pantoprazole and maropitant. 16 QUESTION 8 • Write down the meaning of the following terms. If there are any you do not understand, please look them up in a veterinary dictionary. venous return, cardiac output, hypovolaemic shock, percutaneous, trocharization, laparotomy, centesis, gastropexy, ventricular premature contraction • Add the treatment to your flow diagram on your whiteboard. Your flow diagram should now explain the mechanism underlying Jack’s problems and include evidence from the history, examination findings, investigations and treatment. • What are the potential complications that could arise in the post-operative period that you will need to forewarn Mrs. Matthews about? • How do you think these complications would be managed? What treatment strategies might be required? • Are antibiotics required post operatively? • What advice would you give to Mrs. Matthews about Jack’s long term management? QUIZ 2 Click back to the LMS and attempt Quiz 2 before continuing. 17 proGress After an uneventful night, you re-examine Jack with Leonie the following morning. Your observations are recorded below. He is maintained on intra-venous fluids, and treated with IV metoclopramide, pantoprazole, maropitant and methadone for pain relief. Treatment with oral sucralfate is commenced. General observations Bright and standing up in cage. Cardiovascular system Pink, moist mucous membranes, capillary refill time 1.5s (1-1.5s), heart rate 120, good pulse quality, no heart murmur or arrhythmia. Respiratory system Respiratory rate 24, lungs clear on auscultation, normal respiratory pattern Neurological status Walking normally, bright, alert and responsive. Abdominal palpation Abdomen is relaxed, mild discomfort in the vicinity of the suture line Temperature 38.3°C (normal 38.0 - 39.0 °C) Weight kg 32.3 QUESTION 9 • Compare the MBA observations you made when Jack came in to the clinic originally (below) with the observations above. What are the underlying mechanisms that have resulted in these changes? His original results were: General observations Weak, collapsed, painful, drooling. Cardiovascular system Pale, tacky mucous membranes, capillary refill time 3s (1-1.5s), heart rate 165 (80 - 100), weak pulses, no heart murmur or arrhythmia. Respiratory system Tachypnoea, lungs clear on auscultation, rapid and shallow respiratory pattern Neurological status Unable to walk, depressed Abdominal palpation Abdomen is distended, tympanic and painful Temperature 36.8°C (normal 38.0 - 39.0 °C) Weight kg 31.0 18 Later that day Jack is offered a small amount of Hills a/d food which he eats enthusiastically. The next day he is given several small meals of Hills i/d food (chicken/rice) which he is by now positively devouring. He is removed from the intravenous fluids. By day three he has had all his medications discontinued and is ready to go home. Mrs. Matthews is advised that he can be discharged that evening. outcome At Jack’s discharge consultation, Leonie advises Mrs. Matthews that in future he will need to be given small meals at regular intervals (at least twice daily). “Even though we have attached the stomach to the abdominal wall,” she says, “dogs that have experienced GDV are prone to recurrent episodes of distension. Jack’s breed type, with his relatively narrow and deep chest, predisposes him to gastric dilatation.” Mrs. Matthews replies that when she rang the breeder to tell her about his hospitalization, she discovered that one of his littermates had died last year of a similar problem. Mrs. Matthews makes an appointment for a revisit in a week to have Jack’s sutures removed. QUESTION 10 • Summarize the key points of Jack’s post surgical management. Look up the mechanism of action for any medication you are not familiar with and summarise it in a few words below. • Explain the physiological rationale for each of these management strategies • Review and refine the flow chart that you developed during this case study on the white board to explain the pathophysiological mechanism of Jack’s condition. Add to your flow chart any predisposing factors that may have contributed. Please photograph your whiteboard to help you review this subject in the future. 19 learninG outcomes At the end of this learning exercise you should be able to: • Outline the treatment and management of gastric dilation and volvulus (GDV) in the dog. • Visualize the changes in the configuration of the stomach that occur in GDV in order to prepare you to surgically correct the condition in the future. • Appreciate the systemic effects that may arise as a consequence of a changes in the configuration of the digestive tract. • Draw a flow diagram to explain the pathophysiology of GDV. further readinG Tivers M. and Brockman D.
