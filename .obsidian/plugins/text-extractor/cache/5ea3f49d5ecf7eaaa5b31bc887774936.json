Normal cat liver – the liver has a large functional reserve and considerable regenerative capacity Because of the large functional reserve, liver failure is unlikely to result from focal or multifocal lesions such as abscesses. Liver failure can result from severe acute parenchymal damage (e.g. acute massive necrosis due to toxicity (top). The most common cause of liver failure is chronic (persistent or repetitive) and diffuse parenchymal injury, circumstances which can lead to cirrhosis (bottom). Jaundice of the sclera of a cow (left) and of pinnal skin in a cat (right) Bilirubin metabolism in health – jaundice reflects disturbance of the pre-hepatic, hepatic or post-hepatic processes Haemolytic anaemia is a potential cause of jaundice – microscopic and macroscopic (inset) agglutination (clumping) of erythrocytes due to immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia in a dog Haemolytic anaemia (intra-vascular and/or extravascular) can result from oxidative injury to haemoglobin in RBC. Heinz body anaemia in a cat due to paracetamol toxicity. Hepatocytes take up unconjugated bilirubin from the sinusoidal blood, conjugate it and then secrete it into bile canaliculi. Hepatocyte secretion of conjugated bilirubin into the canaliculi requires energy and is the rate-limiting step in bilirubin metabolism in most species. Intra-hepatic cholestasis with plugging of bile canaliculi Intra-hepatic cholestasis with plugging of bile canaliculi Intra-hepatic cholestasis with plugging of bile canaliculi, multifocal rupture of canaliculi and chemotaxis of leukocytes in response to free bile Intra-hepatic cholestasis with bile pigmentation of hepatocytes and Kupffer cells and plugging of canaliculi Extra-hepatic bile duct obstruction in a dog (due to compression of the distal end of the common bile duct by a duodenal neoplasm) with marked distension of the common bile duct and gall bladder Extra-hepatic bile duct obstruction with distension of portal bile ducts by retained bile Severe peribiliary fibrosis due to chronic extra-hepatic bile duct obstructionJaundice of the sclera in a dog – jaundice becomes clinically detectable once the serum bilirubin concentration exceeds approximately 35 µmol/LIntense icteric discolouration of the elastin-rich aorta in a foal Intense jaundice in a sheep with chronic copper poisoning – intensity of jaundice is greatest if there is more than one mechanism promoting hyperbilirubinaemia (in this condition, there is both hepatic disease and haemolytic anaemia) In horses and some cattle, jaundice needs to be distinguished from the yellow discolouration of fat that is attributable to dietary carotenoid pigments – normal yellow mesenteric fat in a horse.Hepatogenous photosensitisation in a Hereford steer Hepatogenous photosensitisationHepatogenous photosensitisation Hepatogenous photosensitisationHepatogenous photosensitisationHepatogenous photosensitisationHepatogenous photosensitisationHepatogenous photosensitisation in a horseHepatogenous photosensitisationHepatogenous photosensitivity conjunctivitis in a sheepHepatogenous photosensitisation in a sheepHepatogenous photosensitisation (due to facial eczema) Hepatogenous photosensitisation in herbivores requires consumption of green feed, conversion of chlorophyll to phylloerythrin by gastrointestinal bacteria, several days of intrahepatic or extrahepatic cholestasis, and exposure to ultraviolet radiation. Hepatogenous photosensitisation Head-pressing in a dog due to hepatic encephalopathyHead-pressing and ataxia in a horse due to hepatic encephalopathy Excessive drooling of saliva (ptyalism) may be a clinical sign of hepatic encephalopathy in cats. Congenital or acquired portosystemic shunting of blood can result in hepatic encephalopathy. So too can a substantial reduction in the functional mass of the liver. • ammonia* • mercaptans* • short chain fatty acids* • skatoles* • indoles* • aromatic amino acids* • octopamine • tryptophan • serotonin • gamma-aminobutyric acid* Molecules that contribute to the pathogenesis of hepatic encphelopathy. Those marked with an asterisk are absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and pass to the liver via the portal vein. Swollen nuclei of astrocytes (Alzheimer type 2 cells) in hepatic encephalopathy Oedematous vacuolation of myelin of the white matter of the brain in a dog with hepatic encephalopathy“Bottle jaw” (subcutaneous submandibular oedema) in a ram due to hypoalbuminaemia Ascites in a cow due to portal hypertension caused by severe hepatic fibrosis induced by chronic liver fluke infestation (chronic fascioliasis) Chronic peribiliary fibrosis (left) induced by infestation of the bile ducts by adult liver flukes in a cow (chronic fascioliasis) Potential causes of portal hypertension: cirrhosis of the liver (left) and portal-portal bridging fibrosis (right) Portal hypertension leads to passive congestion of the splanchnic viscera (stomach, intestines, spleen and pancreas)  increased hydrostatic pressure in venules and capillary beds  low protein ascites +/- fluid loss into the bowel lumen Ascites (typically a transudate) in a dog with portal hypertension Dog with ascites due to right-sided congestive heart failure The most common mechanism responsible for ascites in animals with liver disease is a rise in pressure within the hepatic perisinusoidal spaces (e.g. in right-sided congestive heart failure, or in animals with fibrosis, persistent inflammation or neoplasia of the hepatic parenchyma)  increased hepatic lymph formation  modified transudate ascites. Pooling of venous blood in the central vein (CV) and periacinar (centrilobular) sinusoids in a cat with right-sided congestive heart failure CV Increased pressure in the hepatic sinusoids  increased pressure in the perisinusoidal spaces  increased formation of hepatic lymph (which is rich in the proteins normally produced by hepatocytes). Ascites in a dog due to right-sided congestive heart failure – the modified transudate pours off the surface of the liver Polyuria/polydipsia can be a manifestation of liver failure, especially in dogs Partial loss of the normal colour of canine faeces due to photo-oxidation of bile pigments in stale faeces left exposed to sunlight. With a complete extra-hepatic bile duct obstruction, cream or white faeces may be passed due to lack of excretion of conjugated bilirubin into bile. Steatorrhoea (excess lipid in faeces due to failure of secretion of bile acids into bile) may contribute to the pallor of faeces in animals with a complete extra-hepatic bile duct obstruction.Decreased production of coagulation factors in liver failure may predispose to haemorrhage Most of the coagulation factors in blood are produced by hepatocytes. Most of the anticoagulants in blood are also produced by hepatocytes. Animals in liver failure can therefore be predisposed to either haemorrhage or thrombosis. \\ Bilirubinuric nephrosis in a dog – note the green-yellow discolouration of the renal parenchyma Bilirubinuric nephrosis in a foal – in this case, the renal parenchyma is stained orange-yellow Ammonium biurate crystals may be seen in the urine of especially dogs with liver failure or portosystemic shunting, due to supersaturation of the urine with ammonium ions. Animals in liver failure may have episodes of hypoglycaemia during fasting periods and episodes of prolonged hyperglycaemia post-prandially. Hyperkeratosis of footpads in a dog with hepatocutaneous syndrome Hyperkeratosis of periocular and muzzle skin and footpads in a dog with hepatocutaneous syndrome Humans in liver failure may develop a musty odour (foetor hepaticus) due to bacterial mercaptans, and males may develop signs of feminisation due to failure of hepatic biotransformation of steroid hormones. These signs are not usually observed in domestic animals.","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
