Incidental anomalies include absence or duplication of the gall bladder, abnormal lobe fissures, accessory or ectopic hepatic tissue, and subcapsular cysts. We will focus on those malformations that can be responsible for significant clinical disease: absence or atresia of the extra-hepatic bile ducts, malformations of the intra-hepatic bile ducts (ductal plate malformations) and especially congenital portosystemic shunts. In this lecture, we will also review the following degenerative processes that can afflict the liver as a consequence of sublethal injury to hepatocytes: hydropic degeneration, fatty degeneration (fatty change or lipidosis), glycogen accumulation, amyloidosis, and diffuse or localised atrophy. The gross and microscopic characteristics of each of these changes will be discussed, in conjunction with their possible causes and consequences. The range of pigments that may accumulate in the livers of domestic animals will also be reviewed. We will also cover briefly the causes and consequences of displacement of the liver, torsion of a liver lobe, and hepatic rupture in domestic animals.
