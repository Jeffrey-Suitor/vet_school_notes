Components: • Water 87% • Butterfat 3 - 4% • Protein 3 – 3.5% – 80% casein, 20% whey proteins • Carbohydrate 4.9% – Lactose • Minerals (esp Calcium, Phosphorus) • Vitamins (esp Vitamin A) 2 What determines milk quality? Butterfat + Protein = Milk Solids Bulk Milk Cell Count (BMCC) Bacterial count • Bactoscan, Thermoduric Freezing point Residues Sediment ... 3 How does milk quality affect profitability? (Milk payments) Base payment + incentives - penalties 4 • Produce >43% in ‘off season’ • Produce more than prev 2yr av • Incentive for larger vats • BMCC: inflammatory (and other) cells • Bactoscan: bacteria • Thermoduric: heat resist organisms • Inhibitory substances: e.g. antibiotics, other chemicals • Temp: at collection <5ᵒC ($/kg MS) Butterfat + Protein = Milk Solids https://lactalis.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Victoria_Tasmania_Southern-Riverina_South-Australia_Lactalis_Supplier_Handbook_20-21.pdf How could you maximise profitability through producing quality milk? Nutrition Genetics Good management 6 Mastitis and BMCC Inflammation of the mammary gland, typically due to bacterial infection Most economically important disease to dairy industry • Reduced milk production • Loss of BCS • Poorer milk quality milk (reduced payment) due to increased BMCC • Cull cattle • Cost of treatment • Antibiotic use Clinical mastitis also impacts animal welfare Good prevention, management and appropriate treatment of mastitis important Mastitis Sub-clinical • No visible changes in milk, udder or cow • Decreased milk production • Decreased milk quality - Cell Count (>250,000/ml) • Not treated during lactation (generally) – “Dry Cow Therapy” (Antibiotics at end of lactation) • Cull ? Clinical • Obvious changes in milk +/- udder +/- cow • Mild to severe/fatal • Treat with antibiotics etc • Withhold milk… “on the bucket” – Unfit for human consumption • Cull ? 78 Mastitis and BMCC Good management plays an important role in the prevention and management of mastitis: • Milking/ milking machine management • Good hygiene and other preventative measures • Appropriate treatment of affected animals 9 Herd testing (aka “herd recording”) • Processors evaluate bulk milk quality at each collection (bulk milk testing) • Farmers can also monitor individual cows periodically for… • Milk production – Litres – BF (kg and %) – Protein (kg and %) • Individual Cow Cell Count (ICCC) – Subclinical mastitis detection Also provides farmer with repro/fertility data • ~40% of Australian herds “herd test” AEPS – DAIRY WEEK 2 10","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
