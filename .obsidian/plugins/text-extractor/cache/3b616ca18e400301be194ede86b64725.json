If the ascites were due to right-sided congestive heart failure, what would be the characteristics of the fluid sample? Why? 2 Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical Dog with severe ascites If the ascites were due to hypoalbuminaemia, what would you expect to be the characteristics of a peritoneal fluid sample? The sample would be classified as a transudate, low in protein and in total nucleated cell count. Grossly, the sample would resemble water – i.e. clear/transparent. If the ascites were due to right-sided congestive heart failure, what would be the characteristics of the fluid sample? Why? The sample would be classified as a modified transudate, high in protein but low in total nucleated cell count. Grossly, the fluid might be colourless or pink or red due to blood staining, clear to slightly cloudy, and may contain obvious fibrin coagula. In right-sided congestive heart failure, venous blood pools in the central veins and sinusoids of the liver, raising the hydrostatic pressure in the sinusoids and therefore causing increased hepatic lymph formation in the perisinusoidal space (space of Disse). If the lymph formation exceeds the draining capacity of the hepatic lymphatics, the excess fluid oozes from distended lymphatics beneath the hepatic capsule into the abdominal cavity. Hepatic lymph is rich in proteins, due to the numerous proteins synthesised by the hepatocytes and exported into the sinusoids. Therefore, the ascites resulting from diffuse hepatic congestion is rich in proteins, including fibrinogen which polymerises to form grossly obvious fibrin coagula. 3 Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical Dog with unilateral distal forelimb oedema Which of the possible mechanisms responsible for oedema formation would you consider likely in this dog? Which of the mechanisms would you exclude? 4 Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical Dog with unilateral distal forelimb oedema Which of the possible mechanisms responsible for oedema formation would you consider likely in this dog? This is an example of localised oedema. Plausible underlying mechanisms include: • increased vascular permeability due to local inflammation/infection • localised lymphatic obstruction (e.g. lymphangitis, lymphadenitis, neoplastic infiltration of draining lymph node(s) etc.) • localised venous obstruction with increased venous and capillary hydrostatic pressure (e.g. local venous thrombosis). Which of the mechanisms would you exclude? As this is localised oedema, not generalised, the following mechanisms can be excluded: • decreased plasma oncotic pressure due to hypoalbuminaemia • generalised venous hypertension due to right-sided congestive heart failure • hypernatraemia (salt retention). 5 Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical Sheep with bottlejaw Which of the possible mechanisms responsible for oedema formation would you consider likely in this animal? 6 Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical Sheep with bottlejaw Which of the possible mechanisms responsible for oedema formation would you consider likely in this animal? The severe submandibular oedema could be due to any of the following mechanisms: • increased vascular permeability due to local inflammation/infection • localised lymphatic obstruction (e.g. lymphangitis, lymphadenitis, neoplastic infiltration of draining lymph node(s) etc.) • localised venous obstruction with increased venous and capillary hydrostatic pressure (e.g. local venous thrombosis) • decreased plasma oncotic pressure due to hypoalbuminaemia • generalised venous hypertension due to right-sided congestive heart failure • hypernatraemia (salt retention) In ruminants, submandibular and/or brisket oedema are common manifestations of generalised oedema, probably promoted by gravitational pooling of the oedema fluid in loose ventral subcutaneous and fascial tissues in animals that graze for long periods of the day with their heads down. 7 Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical Horse lung with diffuse congestion and oedema due to left-sided congestive heart failure 8 Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical 9 Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical Horse lung with diffuse acute pulmonary oedema Note the watery oedema fluid that oozes off the cut surface of the lung, especially when the latter is manually compressed. 10 Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical 11 Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical Horse trachea and lung What does the foam indicate? What makes up the foam? Why is it pink-red? 12 Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical Horse trachea and lung What does the foam indicate? What makes up the foam? Why is it pink-red? Foam indicates the presence of pulmonary oedema. If the foam extends up the lumina of the primary bronchi into the trachea, there is at least moderately severe pulmonary oedema. In severe pulmonary oedema, the foam may extend further proximally up the airways and flow from the nostrils. The stable foam is a mixture of oedema fluid, air bubbles and surfactant. Pink-red foam indicates the presence of intact or lysed red blood cells. It suggests that the pulmonary oedema is accompanied by pulmonary congestion or haemorrhage. Pulmonary oedema alone produces white foam. 13 Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical Dog, vegetative valvular endocarditis with septic thromboembolism of coronary arteries and multifocal myocardial abscessation 14 Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical 15 Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical Dog, vegetative valvular endocarditis of the mitral valve What are the typical gross features of thrombi that form within the heart or within arteries? Why? 16 Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical Dog, vegetative valvular endocarditis of the mitral valve What are the typical gross features of thrombi that form within the heart or within arteries? Why? Intra-cardiac and arterial thrombi are usually firm and pale yellow and have a dull, dry, rough surface because they are chiefly composed of sticky platelets and fibrin. The high velocity and pressure of arterial and intra-cardiac blood flow sweep the other components of blood (plasma, leukocytes and erythrocytes) away, leaving only the tenacious platelets and fibrin. Because large areas of endothelium need to be damaged before thrombosis will occur in large arterial vessels or within the heart, arterial and intra-cardiac thrombi are usually firmly anchored over a broad zone to the underlying vessel wall, valve or heart chamber wall. Because of the fast and high-pressure blood flow over their surface, arterial and intra-cardiac thrombi are also initially mural and non-occlusive. They may contain grossly obvious laminations due to further coagulation occurring on their protruding surface. 17 Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical Calf, vegetative valvular endocarditis 18 Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical 19 Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical Ox, vegetative valvular endocarditis In this case, dark red clotted blood is loosely adherent to the surface of the thrombus. This merely reflects terminal coagulation of whole blood as the blood flow and pressure drops prior to death. The recently coagulated blood can be removed relatively easily post mortem, revealing the much more tenacious original underlying septic thrombus. 20 Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical 21 Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical Ox, vegetative valvular endocarditis 22 Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical 23 Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical Ox, vegetative valvular endocarditis 24 Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical 25 Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical Ox, vegetative valvular endocarditis 26 Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical 27 Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical Ox, vegetative valvular endocarditis 28 Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical 29 Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical Ox, pulmonic valve endocarditis What would be the effect of this lesion on cardiovascular function? How long has this thrombus been present? 30 Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical Ox, pulmonic valve endocarditis What would be the effect of this lesion on cardiovascular function? The thrombus has completely occluded blood outflow from the right ventricle into the pulmonary artery. Cor pulmonale (right-sided heart disease due to sustained pulmonary arterial hypertension) is present and the cow would have died in right-sided congestive heart failure. How long has this thrombus been present? The concentric hypertrophy of the right ventricular myocardium is consistent with chronic pulmonic valve endocarditis and hence a chronic pressure overload on the right ventricle. The thrombus would have originally been mural and incompletely occlusive during this phase of the disease course. 31 Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical Dog, pulmonary arterial thrombosis or thromboembolism with acute haemorrhagic pulmonary infarction Why does thrombosis or thromboembolism of the pulmonary artery or one of its branches not necessarily result in pulmonary infarction? 32 Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical Dog, pulmonary arterial thrombosis or thromboembolism with acute haemorrhagic pulmonary infarction Why does thrombosis or thromboembolism of the pulmonary artery or one of its branches not necessarily result in pulmonary infarction? The lung has a dual arterial blood supply (pulmonary artery from the right ventricle, containing poorly oxygenated blood, and bronchial artery from the aorta, containing oxygenated blood). If more than 60% of pulmonary arterial flow is suddenly obstructed, the animal will probably die from peracute cor pulmonale and right-sided congestive heart failure before there is time for gross or clinical evidence of pulmonary ischaemia to develop. If a medium to small branch of the pulmonary artery is suddenly obstructed, a pulmonary infarct is only likely to develop if there is pre-existent compromised oxygen supply to the dependent area of lung (e.g. existing pulmonary oedema, congestion, pneumonia or anaemia). Without a pre-existing condition lowering the oxygen concentration, the bronchial arterial supply is usually adequate to prevent infarction. 33 Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical Cow, metastatic renal carcinoma with pulmonary arterial thromboembolism Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical 34 Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical 35 Cat, aortic saddle thromboembolism due to cardiomyopathy and thrombosis within the left atrium What clinical signs might this cat have displayed prior to euthanasia? Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical 36 Cat, aortic saddle thromboembolism due to cardiomyopathy and thrombosis within the left atrium What clinical signs might this cat have displayed prior to euthanasia? Sudden onset of unilateral or bilateral hindlimb paresis (weakness) is typical. The affected limb(s) may feel cold due to cessation of arterial blood flow, with cyanosis of the nail beds. The muscles of the affected limb(s) become firmer as they undergo ischaemic necrosis. Saddle thromboembolism of the distal aortic trifurcation is the most common sequel to intra-cardiac thrombosis in the left atrium of cats with cardiomyopathy. However, thromboemboli from the left atrium can lodge elsewhere (e.g. in renal, mesenteric, bronchial, coronary, brachial or carotid arterial branches off the aorta). Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical 37 Horse, abdominal aorta and proximal cranial mesenteric artery Thrombosis of the root of the cranial mesenteric artery due to Strongylus vulgaris larvae (verminous arteritis) The large strongyle nematode, Strongylus vulgaris, has a complex life cycle. Infective third-stage larvae are ingested off contaminated pasture, exsheath in the small intestine, penetrate the mucosa and submucosa of the small and large intestine, and then moult. The fourth-stage larvae (about 1 mm in length) penetrate submucosal arterioles of the intestine, and then migrate across the intima of the blood vessels against the flow of arterial blood up as far as the root of the cranial mesenteric artery. They persist there for 3-4 months before moulting again and then returning in ileocaecocolic arterial blood to the caecum and colon where they form mucosal and submucosal nodules. Ultimately, the adults emerge into the large intestinal lumen and reach sexual maturity over the next two months. The larvae in the cranial mesenteric artery damage the intima and provoke mural (and occasionally occlusive) thrombosis, chronic inflammation and fibrosis. This is often referred to as “verminous arteritis”. Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical 38 Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical 39 Horse, verminous arteritis in the proximal cranial mesenteric artery Larvae of Strongylus vulgaris and sometimes immature adults may be found embedded in the rough- surfaced thombus in the cranial mesenteric arterial root.

Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical 46 Cow, septic pulmonary thromboembolism and (below, left) septic pulmonary infarcts Where might the thromboemboli have originated? Likely sites of origin are septic thrombi (vegetative endocarditis) on the tricuspid or pulmonic valves (right side of the heart), septic jugular thrombosis, or an hepatic abscess that has eroded into a hepatic vein and thence seeded into the caudal vena cava. Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical 47 Cow, septic pulmonary thromboembolism Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical 48 Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical 49 Cow, septic pulmonary thromboembolism Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical 50 Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical 51 Calf, septic pulmonary thromboembolism A = septic thromboemboli in the pulmonary arterial branches What is your explanation for the colour of the thromboemboli? What does B indicate? Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical 52 Calf, septic pulmonary thromboembolism A = septic thromboemboli in the pulmonary arterial branches What is your explanation for the colour of the thromboemboli? The dark red component of the thromboembolus is whole clotted blood. The cream-yellow pockets are pockets of suppurative exudate (pus). What does B indicate? This is a pulmonary abscess where the bacteria in the septic thromboembolus have established infection in the lung parenchyma. Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical 53 Cow, septic pulmonary thromboembolism The mottled heterogeneous appearance of the thromboembolus is highly suggestive that it is septic, with irregular mixture of whole clotted blood and pus. Septic thrombi and thromboemboli are soft and friable because of the presence of large numbers of neutrophils. They are therefore especially prone to fragment and embolise. Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical 54 Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical 55 Jugular phlebothrombosis in a horse What is the typical gross appearance of a venous thrombus? Why do they look like this? What features would help you distinguish a genuine ante mortem thrombus from a post mortem blood clot? Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical 56 Jugular phlebothrombosis in a horse What is the typical gross appearance of a venous thrombus? Why do they look like this? Venous thrombi are typically occlusive and form an almost perfect cast of the blood vessel. They have a smooth, shiny surface and moist consistency when fresh. They are typically dark red. Laminations are usually poorly defined or absent. The slower flow rate within the venous system allows occlusive thrombosis to develop rapidly, with complete activation of the coagulation cascade and entrapment of red cells and leukocytes into the clotted whole blood. The moist consistency reflects the plasma water trapped in the thrombus. What features would help you distinguish a genuine ante mortem thrombus from a post mortem blood clot? A genuine venous thrombus should have a point of attachment to the wall of the blood vessel. However, the attachment site is often small and flimsy and easily overlooked or disrupted during a post mortem examination. The most reliable clue in genuine venous thrombosis is the presence of congestion with or without oedema or venous infarction upstream from the thrombus. Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical 57 Jugular phlebothrombosis in a horse What might have triggered thrombosis in this horse? What effect would this lesion have on the horse’s head? Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical 58 Jugular phlebothrombosis in a horse What might have triggered thrombosis in this horse? Jugular phlebothrombosis can be triggered by inept or repeated venipuncture, non-sterile venipuncture with introduction of bacteria, intravenous injection of irritant solutions and use of indwelling catheters. Prolonged venous congestion (e.g. right-sided congestive heart failure) and blood hypercoagulability are less common causes. What effect would this lesion have on the horse’s head? Initially, occlusive thrombosis of a jugular vein would be expected to cause upstream congestion with increased hydrostatic pressure in venous branches, venules and capillary beds and hence oedema formation, all on the same side as the affected vein. The affected half of the head and proximal neck might feel cooler than the opposite side. However, there are numerous venous anastomoses available so the congestion and oedema would be expected to subside relatively quickly. Bilateral occlusive jugular phlebothrombosis would be a much more serious condition as it would result in generalised congestion and oedema of the head and neck and potentially thrombosis within intracranial venous sinuses. Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical 59 Horse, pulmonary thromboembolism as a consequence of jugular phlebothrombosis As these are venous thromboemboli, why are they not uniformly dark red in colour? Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical 60 Horse, pulmonary thromboembolism as a consequence of jugular phlebothrombosis As these are venous thromboemboli, why are they not uniformly dark red in colour? These are septic thromboemboli and the cream-yellow appearance reflects the presence of large numbers of neutrophils (i.e. pus mixed with coagulated venous blood). Old sterile venous thrombi and thromboemboli may also appear variegated and pale cream due to progressive lysis/phagocytosis of the entrapped erythrocytes, and progressive organisation/recanalisation. Organising venous thrombi become palpably firm and appear dry with a non-glistening surface (due to resorption of water).

Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical 68 Pig, ear pinna Cutaneous infarction due to arterial thrombosis in Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae bacteraemia/septicaemia Why are the areas of ischaemic necrosis dark red-brown if they have resulted from obstruction of arterial blood flow? Haemorrhage has occurred into the necrotic areas through the walls of damaged blood vessels, particularly seepage from hypoxic but non-occluded vessels at the margins of the infarcts. Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical 69 Pig, skin Cutaneous infarction due to arterial thrombosis in Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae bacteraemia/septicaemia (so-called “diamond skin disease”) Comparable cutaneous lesions can be seen in pigs with other systemic bacterial infections provoking vascular endothelial damage and thrombosis, e.g. septicaemic salmonellosis.

Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical 72 Pig, skin Cutaneous infarction due to arterial thrombosis in Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae bacteraemia/septicaemia (so-called “diamond skin disease”) Why do these lesions have a rhomboid or diamond shape rather than the wedge shape expected with an infarct? The classic wedge shape (with the occluded vessel at its apex) will only be observed if an infarct is sectioned in the appropriate plane. You are looking at the flat base of the three-dimensional wedge. The occluded vessel is deep in the dermis or subcutis below the skin surface and towards the centre of the diamond.

Why? Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical 76 Pigs, skin Cutaneous infarction due to arterial thrombosis in Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae bacteraemia/septicaemia If you look closely, you will see that the margin of the infarcts is often highlighted by a thin red line? Why? These pigs have survived long enough to begin to mount an inflammatory response to the necrotic tissue. The red marginal line is indicative of reactive inflammatory hyperaemia (increased arterial blood flow into capillary beds) in the viable tissue immediately adjacent to the infarcts. Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical 77 Lamb, scrotum and testis after castration by elastration After application of an elastration band proximal to the scrotum, the testes undergo ischaemic coagulative necrosis. Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical 78 Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical 79 Lamb (left) and goat (right), digital lesions caused by ergotism In ergotism, an ingested fungal toxin (mycotoxin) causes sustained vasoconstriction of arterioles (mediated by stimulation of adrenergic nerve fibres), resulting in ischaemic. This mechanism of ischaemia is akin to frostbite of the extremities in very cold climates. Ergotism is caused by toxic lysergic acid-derivative alkaloids (e.g. ergotamine, ergometrine, ergotaxine) produced by the fungus, Claviceps purpurea, growing on various grass species and cereal grains. Ergotism is seen most often in cattle and especially involving the distal limbs, and sometimes the ear tips and tail. A comparable syndrome of dry gangrene of the extremities (so-called “fescue foot”) can be induced by ergopeptide alkaloids (e.g. ergovaline) produced by the fungus, Neotyphodium coenophialum, growing on tall fescue grass (Festuca arundinacea).

Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical 86 Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical 87 Cow, ergotism This animal has also been neglected.

This was caused by a systemic bacterial infection with damage to vascular endothelium and subsequent thrombosis. The obstructed arterial vessel is located at the apex (arrow) of the wedge of ischaemic necrosis. What type of necrosis results from ischaemic injury in the central nervous system? Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical 90 Dog, brain This dog has a haemorrhagic infarct (a localised area of ischaemic injury) in the cortex of its brain. This was caused by a systemic bacterial infection with damage to vascular endothelium and subsequent thrombosis. The obstructed arterial vessel is located at the apex (arrow) of the wedge of ischaemic necrosis. What type of necrosis results from ischaemic injury in the central nervous system? Liquefactive necrosis In tissues other than the brain and spinal cord, ischaemic (hypoxic) injury typically induces coagulative necrosis. In the brain and spinal cord, the necrotic tissue liquefies and softens (malacia).

Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical 92 Foal, kidney What is indicated by the arrow? A wedge-shaped infarct Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical 93 Cattle, renal infarcts Why are renal infarcts common? Why are some of these lesions not a classical wedge shape? Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical 94 Cattle, renal infarcts Why are renal infarcts common? The end-arterial design of the kidneys renders them vulnerable to arterial infarcts. Kidneys receive up to 25% of cardiac output so that any arterial thromboemboli or other emboli are likely to become trapped there. Why are some of these lesions not a classical wedge shape? A wedge (with the occluded vessel at its apex) will only be observed if an infarct is sectioned in the appropriate plane. From the renal capsular surface, infarcts often appear of rhomboid shape because you are looking at the flat base of the three-dimensional wedge. Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical 95 Sheep and dog kidneys with infarcts Place the lesions in chronological sequence, from most recent to oldest. A B D C A B D C Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical 96 Sheep and dog kidneys with infarcts Place the lesions in chronological sequence, from most recent to oldest. D, A, B, C Peracute renal arterial infarcts (e.g. D) are initially grossly invisible but, after approximately 12 hours, appear pale cream, with the affected tissue flush with the adjacent viable tissue. Acute renal arterial infarcts (e.g. A) are swollen and red due to bleeding into the necrotic tissue from blood vessels bordering the infarct. This appearance is typical from about 24 hours after onset. Subacute renal arterial infarcts (e.g. B) are variably coloured. Dehaemoglobinisation of the infarct is usually prominent from about 36 hours after onset, due to lysis of extravasated erythrocytes and phagocytosis by invading leukocytes (especially macrophages). During this phase, a prominent red margin (hyperaemia) and a cream-white line (where invading leukocytes are concentrated) may become grossly visible. Depending on the size of the infarct, dehaemoglobinisation may be complete by 3 days after onset. At this point, the infarct will be pale cream-yellow but will still be swollen (due to the addition of leukocytes). Chronic renal infarcts (e.g. C) are essentially contracted scars. Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical 97 Cow, ruminal infarcts These venous infarcts are a consequence of ruminal acidosis (lactic acidosis, grain overload), with entry of fungal hyphae through areas of mucosal ulceration into the submucosa. The hyphae invade submucosal veins, resulting in thrombosis and infarction. The fungi may also embolise via portal vein branches to the liver and beyond. Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical 98 Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical 99 Cow, subacute infarcts in the liver These infarcts are a consequence of portal venous embolism of fungal hyphae from the rumen following ruminal acidosis (lactic acidosis, grain overload). Note the pale cream margins to the foci. These are indicative of repair processes from viable host tissue and are consistent with a subacute time frame. Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical 100 Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical 101 Sheep, liver These are numerous foci of septic bacterial thromboembolism from the gastrointestinal tract via the portal vein. The multifocal distribution pattern is typical of embolism. The white tissue highlighting the lesions is fibrosis, indicating chronicity and the fact that the sheep survived the immediate thromboembolic event for at least several weeks. Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical 102 Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical 103 Dogs, small intestinal intussusception Intestinal intussusception can lead to venous infarction due to external compression (strangulation) of the veins of the mesentery which has fed distally along with a segment of intestine into the intussusceptum. Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical 104 Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical 105 Horse, small intestinal strangulation due to a pedunculated lipoma (arrow) Palpate the fixed specimen. Why is the wall of the infarcted segment of bowel so thick and why is the mucosal surface diffusely dark red-black? Veterinary Bioscience: Cardiovascular System Circulatory Diseases – Pathology Practical 106 Horse, small intestinal strangulation due to a pedunculated lipoma (arrow) Palpate the fixed specimen. Why is the wall of the infarcted segment of bowel so thick and why is the mucosal surface diffusely dark red? Prior to the development of critical hypoxia, the intestinal segment and its strangled mesenteries underwent progressive congestion and oedema. The thickness of the intestinal wall reflects the increase in trapped blood and the accumulation of oedema fluid due to increased venous and capillary hydrostatic pressure. The dark red-black appearance of the infarcted mucosa is due to the intense congestion that preceded ischaemic necrosis. At post mortem, there was a large volume of venous blood in the lumen of the infarcted segment.","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
