Cows – number, breed Seasonal production/ Calving patterns Types of dairy 2 People on dairy farms • Owner-operators • Share-farmers • varying arrangements • owner often owns land and fixed infrastructure +/- some or all of the cows • share-farmer often owns some of the machinery +/- some or all of the cows and provides labour • profits shared between owner and share-farmer • Off-site owners (corporate or individuals) employing a manager/other staff 3 The cows on dairy farms 4 • av. herd size: 279 cows • increasing numbers of large herds (>700 cows) • herds may be cows of all the same breed, different breeds, cross-breeds • stud animals v commercial milkers https://www.dairy.edu.au/information/australian-dairy-cows 5 Seasonality of production on dairy farms • Varies with region Types of calving pattern 6 Seasonal Production Systems • Seasonal calving- cows calve over restricted period • Benefits ₋ make use of available feed (grass growth) ₋ utilise different prices throughout year ₋ efficient utilisation of labour • Disadvantages – what to do with a non-pregnant cow?? ₋ Cull cows ₋ Carrying over dry cows ₋ Milking stale cows over dry period ₋ Genetic improvement of herd halted Year Round Production Systems • Cows calve throughout the year • Benefits: ₋ Ensures year-round milk supply sought by some milk factories (particularly NSW/Qld) – most factories now require processing all year • Disadvantages ₋ prolonged inter-calving interval leads to reduced production (cow spends less time at peak) ₋ reduced numbers calves / lifetime (less genetic gain) ₋ Workload spread over whole year Split/ batch calving 9 • Two (or more) calving periods (often Spring/Autumn) • Spring group often larger to maximise use of pasture availability • Can bring benefits of year round milk payments • Can allow “carrying over” cows who do not get in calf to next group • BUT, is this good practice?
