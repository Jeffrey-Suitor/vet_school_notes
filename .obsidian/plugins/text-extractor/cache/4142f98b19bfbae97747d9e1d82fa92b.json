Do not jump ahead. • This file gives you detailed instructions for completing each activity. Ask your tutor if you have any questions. • For some activities, you will be asked to record your answers to the questions by typing them into this file. You should save this PDF file each time you complete one of these questions, to make sure that your work does not get lost. Guidelines for effective Group work Your group will work at its best when everyone feels comfortable and “safe” to contribute to discussion. Here are a few suggestions that might help promote a safe and effective group work environment: • Ensure that you all know one another’s names- and that you use them during your conversations. • Effective listening is a key to effective group work. Respectful listening enhances a positive group dynamic, and creates a space where it is safe for all to contribute. • Taking time to discuss is really important- discussing involves questioning and responding, reviewing and reflecting, sharing understanding. This is where deep learning occurs. It can often be greatly enhanced by visualisation- by sharing of ideas, summaries and processes on your white board and by collective rephrasing and reframing of ideas. • Sharing of tasks and responsibilities is also important in group work. Perhaps make a roster and each week have a different group member take responsibility for the keyboard, and for completing your interactive pdf. 3 instructions Enter each group member’s name, Iand email address below. After you have completed working through this document, save a copy and follow the instructions at the end of the document to share it with your group via the LMS or email. GROUP NUMBER Name Email Address 4 introduction and intended learninG outcomes This is the first of the Cells to Systems case studies. The purpose of these case studies is to: • Highlight the practical importance of what you have learned in the preceding weeks. • Allow you to apply that knowledge to a real life scenario. • Provide an insight into the problem orientated approach to diagnosis. • Enable you to formulate a treatment plan based on physiological principles. We strongly encourage you to work in a small group format, rather than to undertake the case study on your own. This allows more in-depth discussion of the case material and the underlying principles involved. You will find the more effort you put into these case studies, the more you will get out of them! Real life veterinary practices operate in a team environment and require input from everyone in order to achieve successful outcomes. Please enter your resopnses to the questions in the PDF, and answer the multiple choice questions (MCQs) as you progress through the case. Note that some of the MCQs contain multiple answers. history It is a bright sunny day Sunday in summer. While your friends are at the beach, you are spending your summer visiting an emergency clinic in Victoria. Things are fairly quiet and under control until Mr. Rogers brings his dog Harley in. Harley is a 2 year old male cross breed. Mr. Rogers comments: I was out taking Harley for a walk. He just loves it. He has such a great time running around, sniffing, playing with other dogs, running into bushes, swimming in the river, and eating whatever he can find. Sometimes I wonder what he is up to, but he always catches up eventually when I call. Anyway, when I called him back, Harley seemed to be limping on his left front leg. It didn’t seem too bad at first, and Harley was desperate to continue, so we kept going for another 20 minutes. However the lameness didn’t seem to get better, in fact I think it is a little worse. I think he needs a pain-killer and we’ll be on our way. 5 QUESTION 1 • Identify Harley’s primary problem? • Using the information supplied in the history, create a list of differential diagnoses. A differential diagnosis list is a list of possible explanations for Harley’s problem. See if you can structure your list in a logical fashion and try to rank your “differentials” according to likelihood. Summarize the additional information obtained from the history. • Outline what you would do next. Will you follow Mr. Rogers’ treatment plan or will you do something else? 6 physical examination You decide not to be pressured by Mr Rogers into simply giving Harley some pain relief, but proceed to observe Harley walking before going on to performing a physical examination. You notice that as he walks, Harley is putting less weight on his left forelimb. A picture of his forelimbs is shown to the left. What can you observe? You notice the left forelimb is bigger than the right. It is often useful to use the unaffected limb as a comparison when you are dealing with a lame animal. When you examine the limb it feels warmer than the other leg. Harley seems to try to avoid letting you examine his left leg. When you press on the limb with a finger, you are able to leave an indentation behind which lasts for a few minutes. QUIZ 1 Click back to the LMS and attempt Quiz 1 before continuing. QUESTION 2 • Consult the differential diagnosis list you made previously. Which of these differentials could explain the swelling of Harley’s leg? Provide the mechanism by which the swelling is produced for each. Are you able to remove some of your differentials from the list? • Are you able to reach a definitive diagnosis or do you need to perform further tests. If so what further tests would you perform to refine your differential diagnoses lists? 7 imaGinG You decided to take a radiograph (or “x-ray”) of the left forelimb, shown below. View A: View B: QUIZ 2 Click back to the LMS and attempt Quiz 2 before continuing. QUESTION 3 • Are you able to detect any abnormalities on the radiograph? • Use this information to modify your differential diagnosis list. What will you do next? 8 collapse Soon after the radiograph is taken, Harley starts to get very weak, trembling in the hinds legs. His respiratory rate increases and he has a rapid, shallow respiratory pattern. He starts to salivate and vomits twice. His pupils start to dilate. He then collapses before your eyes. QUIZ 3 Click back to the LMS and attempt Quiz 3 before continuing. QUESTION 4 • Look at your list of differential diagnoses for lameness. Are you able to select one of these which provides an explanation of the history, findings on the physical examination and radiographs and the new symptoms that Harley is now displaying? • What are you going to do next? 9 research Careful evaluation of the history, findings on the physical examination and radiographs and the symptoms that Harley is now displaying makes you think that Harley may have been bitten by a snake. QUESTION 5 • Part of being a scientist is about knowing where to get answers. Over the next 5 - 10 minutes perform a search in order to answer the following questions. • How might you find out about what types of venomous snakes are present in Victoria? How can you ensure the accuracy of this information? Are you able to trust it, knowing that Harley’s life may depend on it? • How might you go about identifying a snake if one is presented to you? Do you have any concerns about this? Can you trust what the owner tells you about the type of snake involved? • Is there a definitive test that will tell you whether Harley has been bitten or not? 10 snake venom detection The most common types of venomous snakes found in Victoria are the Tiger snake, the Brown snake and the Black snake. Definitive identification of snakes is difficult because of natural variations in colour and pattern. Snake identification can be useful in giving treatment, and predicting what signs are likely to develop, but you must be careful not to be bitten! People can be envenomed even by dead snakes! A snake venom detection kit based upon an enzyme immunoassay is available. It is designed for use in Australia for veterinary and human envenomation. The test allows immunological identification of snake venom in tissue, urine and blood. It aids the clinician in deciding which antivenom to administer to a patient who is showing clinical signs of envenomation. Swabbing the bite site is the most effective technique to collect a sample of venom, but is rarely used in veterinary patients since the bite site is not often located and patient hair can make it difficult to perform. Usually urine or whole blood is used.

Being the astute clinician that you are, you repeat your Major Body System assessment (MBA). A MBA is a physical examination to detect abnormalities that are immediately life threatening. Your findings are tabulated below: General observations Collapsed, unable to stand, Harley looks panicked, prolonged skin tenting and tacky mucous membranes (estimated 7% dehydrated) Cardiovascular system Pale mucous membranes, capillary refill time 2s, heart rate 180, pulse quality weak, no murmurs. Respiratory system Pale mucous membranes, tachypnoea, rapid shallow pattern, clear pulmonary auscultation Neurological status Collapsed, unable to stand, dilated non-responsive pupils, decreased gag reflex Abdominal palpation No significant findings Temperature 40.0°C (normal 38.0 - 39.0 °C) Based on your MBA, you suspect that Harley is hypovolaemic (weak, collapsed, tachycardic and poor pulse quality) and is 7% dehydrated (tacky mucous membranes and prolonged skin tenting). You decide as part of your supportive therapy to give him intravenous (into a vein) fluids to help correct his abnormalities. In order to do this, you need to utilize your knowledge about body water and fluid compartments. Harley is 20 kg. QUIZ 4 Click back to the LMS and attempt Quiz 4 before continuing. QUESTION 7 • Draw a schematic diagram on your whiteboard that illustrates the total body water distribution in a normal dog. Populate your diagram with values to indicate the amount of water (in kg) normally present in each fluid compartment in Harley. • What is meant by the terms “hypovolaemia” and “dehydration”? Do you need to prioritize treatment of hypovolaemia or dehydration? Give a reason for your answer. 13 fluid ther apy continued Dehydration is defined as a decrease in total body water. However, in veterinary practice the term dehydration is typically used to refer to fluid deficits in the extravascular space (interstitial dehydration). Hypovolemia refers to fluid deficits in the intravascular space. Correction of hypovolemia is urgent (within 1-2 hours), whereas correction of interstitial dehydration is usually undertaken over 6-24 hours. The MBA has indicated that Harley is suffering from hypovolaemic shock, in addition to dehydration, so we must correct this first. Fluid flux between the intra- and extravascular compartments is governed by Starling’s forces (hydrostatic pressure, oncotic pressure and vessel wall characteristic). Fluid flux between the intracellular and extracellular space is governed by differences in osmolality (primarily sodium concentration gradient). The goal for treatment of hypovolaemic shock is to restore the fluid deficit in the intravascular space. Intravenous fluids are administered via a catheter inserted into one of the peripheral veins. Fluids are administered at high rates in order to restore the vascular volume. There are three main choices of fluid: • Hypertonic saline • Colloids • Isotonic crystalloid fluids e.g. 0.9% NaCl Once the hypovolaemic shock is corrected, isotonic crystalloid fluids are administered at slower rates to correct the dehydration. QUIZ 5 Click back to the LMS and attempt Quiz 5 before continuing. 14 QUESTION 8 • Using your knowledge of osmosis, why do you think hypertonic saline is used to treat hypovolaemic shock? Would it help more with intravascular volume expansion or extravascular interstitial dehydration? More difficult question! Why might hypertonic saline be contra-indicated in Harley’s case? • Colloids consist of slowly metabolized, large macromolecular substances that are suspended in an isotonic fluid. Using your knowledge of Starling’s forces (hydrostatic pressure, oncotic pressure and vessel wall characteristic) why do you think colloids might be given to Harley? Would they help more with intravascular volume expansion or extravascular interstitial dehydration? • If you gave isotonic fluids to Harley, what proportion of the total volume of fluids given would remain in the intravascular space and what proportion would enter the extravascular space? Would isotonic fluids help more with intravascular volume expansion or extravascular interstitial dehydration? • Compare and contrast the use of hypertonic saline, colloids and isotonic crystalloid fluids in the treatment of: 1. hypovolaemic shock 2. dehydration • If you treated Harley with too much fluid, how would the fluid be removed from the interstitium? Hint: it is the same way the tissue oedema in the right forelimb will resolve with time. 15 cellular and systemic effects of venom Snake venom contains a mixture of toxic factors. These toxins cause changes at the cellular level, which are then reflected in changes at the systemic (whole body) level. One of the toxic components in snake venom is phospholipase A2. This can inhibit the electron transfer chain and render mitochondrial bound enzymes soluble. This effectively stops the mitochondria from working. QUESTION 9 • What is the major function of mitochondria and what is the consequence of disruption of this function? • Snake venom has numerous destructive enzymes that affect the cell membrane such as phospholipase, proteolytic enzymes, collagenase, hyaluronidase and amino acid oxidases. Draw a schematic diagram of a cell membrane. Use this diagram to explain the consequences of disruption to its normal function. • From an evolutionary point of view, why do you think snake venom contains these toxic components? 16 Snake venom contains fibrinolytic and prothrombin-like activating enzymes. The result of the action of these enzymes is a depletion of fibrinogen in the blood. Fibrinogen is a protein produced in the liver, which is involved in the formation of blood clots. The snake venom also decreases platelet numbers. Platelets are also involved in the production of a blood clot. You examine Harley’s mouth. There are large discoloured areas on his gums and lips, which are a dark red to purple colour. See the photograph below: You notice several changes to his skin. You clip up an area. Even the gentle trauma of the clipping seems to result in more of the red spots developing. See the photograph below: QUESTION 10 • Interpret these findings and relate them to the toxic effects of snake venom discussed above. How would you treat this condition? 17 You place a drop of blood from Harley on a microscope slide, make a blood smear and stain it with Diff-Quik®. The picture below shows what you see under the microscope. The picture below is from a normal dog. The small purple to blue structures are platelets. Ignore any difference in color of the red blood cells. QUESTION 11 • Compare the morphology of the red blood cells from Harley with the red blood cells of a normal dog. What difference do you notice? Give possible explanations for this change. • If these changes were severe enough, what might happen to the red blood cells? How would this manifest itself in Harley? (Hint: look at the colour of Harley’s mucous membranes in the photograph above). What is the term used to describe this process? 18 Snake venom can affect multiple organ systems including the nervous system. Acute neuromuscular weakness is a key feature in some envenomation. The venoms have a predilection for the peripheral nervous system and neuromuscular junction being the favourite target QUESTION 12 • List the clinical signs you observed in Harley because of snake venom in the peripheral nervous system. • Draw a schematic diagram of the neuromuscular junction and use this diagram to explain how snake venom can affect the neuromuscular communication. • How could the effect of snake venom at the neuromuscular junction lead to the death of Harley? 19 antivenom Antivenom is available for treatment of snake envenomation and has greatly reduced the mortality rate. It is made by the passive immunization of horses or sheep. Basically increasing amounts of a particular snake venom type (black, brown, tiger, death adder, or taipan) is given to a horse or sheep. Via this immunization process, antibodies (globulins) are produced by the animal which are then collected and purified. Antivenom to each of the above snake species is available, as well as combined (polyvalent) antivenom. QUESTION 13 • What problems might you anticipate if you were to give such a product to a dog? • Why should antivenom be swirled not shaken? Unlike James Bond who likes his shaken not stirred! 20 epidemioloGy QUESTION 14 • List the factors that might play a role in determining the severity of a snake bite. • How does snake venom spread around the body? • In this case, Harley continued to exercise after being bitten. Why was this not a good idea? Relate your answer to the previous question. • If Mr. Rogers had witnessed Harley being bitten on the leg, what first aid could he have attempted to limit systemic spread of venom? How does this first aid measure slow down the spread of venom? • How could this snake bite have been avoided? 21 outcome Harley survives being bitten by a Brown snake thanks to your prompt treatment and thorough understanding of basic principles. While in hospital he was treated with antivenom, fluids and clotting factors. He was discharged after 3 days in intensive care. Mr. Rogers is delighted - well done!
