# DS - L6 - Ruminant Forestomach
## Intended Learning Outcomes
- Apply an understanding of the position of the forestomachs within the abdominal cavity, in order to integrate the structural features of the different chambers with their function.
- Utilise your knowledge of the anatomy of the ruminant forestomachs in order to determine the nature of displacements or obstructions when they occur.
- Apply an understanding of the relationship of the forestomachs with other abdominal organs and structures, in order to relate this to the potential for the development of disease in neighbouring structures.
