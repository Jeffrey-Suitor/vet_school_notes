# DS - L6 - Ruminant Forestomach
## Intended Learning Outcomes
- Apply an understanding of the position of the forestomachs within the abdominal cavity, in order to integrate the structural features of the different chambers with their function.
- Utilise your knowledge of the anatomy of the ruminant forestomachs in order to determine the nature of displacements or obstructions when they occur.
- Apply an understanding of the relationship of the forestomachs with other abdominal organs and structures, in order to relate this to the potential for the development of disease in neighbouring structures.

## Compound Stomach

What are the 4 chambers of the compound stomach::a fermentation chamber, Non-glandular (1. Rumen, 2. Reticulum, 3. Omasum), glandular (4. Abomasum)

How big can the adult stomach big in a cow::60-70 L

How does the size of the calf stomach compare to the cow::Due to feeding on milk the stomach will be quite small

What side are the intestines squashed in a cow::Right

What is the biggest compartment in a calf abomasum

What is the reticulum in the ruminant stomach
?
Lies largely on the left side
Is the most cranial compartment
Extends from the cardia to the most cranial part of the diaphragm
Ventrally extends across the midline to lie above the xiphoid
Oesophagus empties into both reticulum and rumen at the cardia

What are the features and functions of the reticulum
?
Sieve for coarse material
Coarse material -> rumen
Fine material -> omasum
Forceful contractions
Folds form honeycomb structures 
Wide ruminoreticular orifice
Medial wall forms reticular groove

What is the largest chamber at birth and in adult hood in the ruminant stomach::At birth, the abomasum is the largest compartment; In the adult, the rumen is the largest

What is traumatic reticuloperitonitis (hardware disease)::When a cow will eat nails or bits of fencing which can enter into the reticulum

What is the rumen
?
Fills left half of the abdominal cavity
Extends across the midline especially caudally and ventrally
dorsal sac may be palpated via the rectum
Dorsal sac is in direct contact with the upper part of the left flank
- Auscultation
- Palpation
- Access

What are the three openings of the reticulum
?
Cardia: is the slit like opening of the oesophagus positioned at the junction of the rumen and reticulum and opens into both chambers. 
Ruminoreticular orifice: wide opening between the rumen and reticulum which communicate over the U-shaped ruminoreticular fold. 
Reticulo-omasal orifice: round exit into the omasum at the lower end of the reticular groove.

T/F the rumen is firmly attached to the body wall::True

What are some of the external features of the rumen::dorsal and ventral curvature, parietal (left) and visceral (right) surface, many grooves which demarcate it into several sacs

What are the 5 + 1 sacs in the rumen::dorsal, ventral, caudodorsal blind, caudoventral blind, cranial sacs + insula ruminis (not a proper sac)

What are the grooves of the rumen::ruminoreticular, right and left longitudinal, accessory, dorsal coronary, ventral coronary, caudal, cranial grooves

What are the 4 layers of the wall of the reticulum::Mucosa, Submucosa, Muscularis externa and Serosa

Where are the intestine held in the ruminant::superomentum recess

What are the pillars of the rumen::ruminoreticular. right and left ruminal, accessory, dorsal coronary, ventral coronary, caudal, cranial

What are the papillae in the rumen and what are there purpose
?
Mucosal projects covering the rumen surface
Vary in height according to age, location, diet
Long/numerous - ventral + dorsal caudal blind sacs
Fewer and less prominent in ventral sac
Shorter or absent on the roof of dorsal sac
Increase the surface area for absorption
Have a many blood vessels

What are the layers of the wall of the rumen
?
Muscularis externa (tunica muscularis)
lamina propria
lamina epithelialis mucosae
ruminal papillae

What are the functions of the rumen
?
Contractions mix ingesta
Fermentation chamber
Absorption of volatile fatty acids, sodium, water, etc.
Papillae increase surface area, assist mixing and act as heating rods
Rumination
Eructation

Explain why rumens have so much gas and how it can be removed::rumen gas cap normal, left paralumbar fossa, last few ribs, gas removed by eructation, ruminal tympany (gaseous distension)

Should the paralumbar fossa be normally concave or convex::concave, if it's convex that means that gas can't escape

What is the omasum::lies mainly on the right of midline, left side faces the rumen and reticulum, right side faces liver and body wall, smallest compartment in sheep and goat

What is the function of the omasum::absorption of fatty acids, water, transfer of ingesta to abomasum, sieve

What are the external features of the omasum
?
Spherical to ellipsoidal shape
Has greater and lesser curvatures
Lower pole has an extensive attachment to the fundic region of the abomasum
Much of the right surface is covered by lesser omentum

What are the internal features of the omasum
?
Two openings
Omasal groove
Omasal laminae
- Many parallel folds of four different sizes
- Arise from greater curvature and sides and project towards the lesser curvature
- Papillae

What is the histological structure of the omasum
?
epithelium and mucosa
lamina propria
smooth muscle
- Thin strip = laminar muscularis mucosa
- Muscularis externa

What is the abomasum
?
True stomach
Glandular stomach (secretes enzymes and mucous)
Elongated and lies on the abdominal floor
Proximal part lies between the ventral sac of the rumen and the reticulum
Caudal end flexed around the lower pole of the omasum

What are some factors that can affect the position of the abomasum::age, pregnancy, fullness of different compartments, intrinsic abomasal activity, contractions of the rumen and reticulum, prone to dorso-lateral displacement

What side do we do a caesarian on a cow::Left because the rumen will prevent other organs from exiting the hole

What are the external features of the abomasum
?
Larger cranial pole
- Pear shaped sac = fundus and body
- Connected by muscle bundles to reticulum ruminal atrium and ventral sac of rumen
Narrower caudal pole
- Forms the pyloric region
- Passes transversely to the right
- Terminates at the pylorus

What are the internal features of the abomasum
?
Two openings: omaso-abomasal orifice, pylorus
Spiral folds
Torus

What is the composition of the wall of the abomasum
?
Mucosa - rich in glands (fundic, pyloric)
Thick muscularis mucosa
Submucosa
Muscularis externa (smooth muscle):
- Thick inner circular layer
- Thinner outer longitudinal layer
Serosa

What is the function of the gastric groove
?
Muscular folds roll into a tube when the young animal drinks milk
Serves as a conduit for covering milk from the oesophagus to the abomasum
May be induced in the adult

What is the name of the combined structure form by the reticular grove and omasum, esophageal groove/gastric groove

What are the functions of the following grooves: reticular, omasal, abomasal
?
Reticular: cardia to reticulo-omasal orifice, bounded by 2 prominent muscular folds
Omasal groove: reticulo omasal orifice to omaso-absomasal orifice
Abomasal groove: area with gastric folds

What is the blood supply of the compound stomach::branches of the Celiac artery, veins drain into the Portal vein

What is the nerve supply of the compound stomach::branches from the dorsal and ventral trunks of the vagus nerve

What is the comparative anatomy of a small ruminant compound stomach compared to a large ruminant
?
Reticulum = relatively larger
Ventral sac of rumen - relatively larger
Caudoventral blind sac extends more caudally than the dorsal
Omasum is the smallest compartment
Abomasum is relatively larger

What causes abomasal displacement
?
Abomasal motility decreases
Gas builds up
Gas-distended abomasum displaces dorsally
Treatment: rolling, surgical or precutaneous sutures
Could be caused by low calcium or high carbohydrate diet (fatty acid build up)
