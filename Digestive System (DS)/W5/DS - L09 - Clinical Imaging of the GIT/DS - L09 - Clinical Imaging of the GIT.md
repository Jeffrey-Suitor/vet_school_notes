# DS - L09 - Clinical Imaging of the GIT

## Intended Learning Outcomes
- List the different methods available for imaging the gastrointestinal tract. 
- Identify the abdominal organs on a lateral and ventrodorsal radiograph of the abdomen of a dog. 
- Recall the radiographic signs of gastrointestinal obstruction.

## Introduction to Imaging

What does radiology produce::x-rays or radiographs of body parts

What does ultrasound do::Uses a pulse echo principle to produce a B mode image where we can review anatomy in real time

What are some common imaging modalities::scintigraphy (nuclear medicine), computed tomography (CT), radiology, ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

### X-Ray

What does X-ray mean::a penetrating form of high energy electromagnetic energy used to make a radiographic image

What does radiograph mean::a recording of the pattern of absorption of x-rays as they pass through the patient

What do light and darker areas on a radiograph represent
?
Lighter: more x-ray absorption
Darker: less x-ray absorption

What is the minimum number of view required to get a complete image of a radiograph::2 views

What are the 3 common projections in radiographs and the 4 projection
?
Right laterally recumbent (right lateral)
Left laterally recumbent (left lateral)
Ventrodorsal
Sometimes Dorsoventral

What are the conventions for displaying radiographs
?
Lateral: HEAD TO THE LEFT
VD/DV: HEAD AT TOP, RIGHT side of patient to left side of screen

What are the 5 basic radiographic opacities from darkest to lightest::gas, fat, fluid and soft tissue, bone, metal

What are some core principles when reading radiographs::dark room, away from distractions

What are the Roentgen signs::size, shape, margins, location, opacity, number

What are the 4 basic parts of a radiographic report::description, radiographic diagnosis, differential diagnoses, recommendations

### Ultrasound

What kind of view does an ultrasound give::cross-sectional view the plane of which is controlled by the transducer

How does computed tomography work::a fine beam of X-rays is passed through the patient, detected, sent to a computer for processing and image is produced

How does Magnetic Resonance Imaging work::magnets and radiofrequency waves map the density of protons = water molecules

How does nuclear medicine work::radiopharmaceutical injected into patient and radiation coming out of patient is detected by the gamma camera and processed by a computer into an image, low spatial resolution but very good for physiological processes

In what way is the stomach different in appearance on the RLR compared to the LLR
?
Gastric gas goes to the uppermost part of the stomach
On RLR, gastric gas is in the FUNDUS
On LLR, gastric gas is in the PYLORUS

## Radiographic Anatomy of the Abdomen

T/F you can always see the spleen on a radiograph::False, the proximal extremity of spleen is fixed by the gastrosplenic ligament which the distal extremity is mobile

### Principles of Imaging GIT

What are some common presentations of animals that may require imaging of the GIT::vomiting, diarrhoea, inappetance, weight loss

What are some important features to examine when looking at a radiograph of the GIT
?
Location
Size-degree of distended: how distended, how much of GIT is affected
Opacity: gas, ingesta (soft tissue), foreign material

What is ileus in radiographic imaging::assess radiograph for evidence of ileus (lack of peristalsis) which may be due to an obstruction or due to a functional disorder

What is obstructive or mechanical ileus
?
Due to a partial or complete obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract
Common causes:
- Foreign body such as a corn cob, toy, string, stone fruit pits
- Mass such as neoplasia
- Intussusception

What is functional ileus (Paralytic or Adynamic ileus)
?
Due to decreased or absent peristalsis (no blockage)
Common causes:
- Electrolyte imbalance
- Gastroenteritis
- Pain
- Sedatives
- Intestinal hypo-perfusion

How can we distinguish between a mechanical and functional ileus
?
Mechanical: Focal moderate to marked distension (may be generalised)
Functional: generalised mild distension (may be focal)

What are the rules and sayings for normal small intestine size in cats and dogs
\?
Dogs: 
1. Ratio of greatest SI diameter to body of L5 not > 1.6 
2. No loop greater than twice the width of others
Cats:
1. No greater than 12 mm in diameter
2. No greater than twice height of L4

How will a mechanical ileus typically present on a radiograph
?
Focal small intestinal distension
Two populations of small intestine
Distended small intestine is 2x diameter of non-distended intestine
Stacking of loops
'hair-pin' bends

How will a functional ileus typically present on a radiograph::mild generalized small intestinal distension, one population of small intestine

What is a contrast study::When a contrast agent is used to analyze the GIT, contrast agents are radiopaque or white, and are used to highlight the position, shape, and size of the gastrointestinal tract. Contrast agents include liquid barium sulphate, iodinated contrast agent

Describe the appearance of the small intestine on ultrasound::lumen is a thin white line, mucosa is a thick dark layer, submucosa is a thin white strip, muscularis is a thin dark layer, serosa which is a thin white layer
