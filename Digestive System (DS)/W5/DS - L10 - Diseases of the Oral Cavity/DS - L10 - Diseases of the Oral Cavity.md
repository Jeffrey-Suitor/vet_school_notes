# DS - L10 - Diseases of the Oral Cavity

## Intended Learning Outcomes
- Analyse the developmental anomalies of the oral cavity and its consequences. 
- Classify the inflammatory lesions in the oral cavity of domestic animals based on aetiology and pathogenesis. 
- Identify and differentiate the proliferative lesions of the oral cavity of domestic animals.

## Portals of Pathogens

What are some portal that pathogens can use to enter the body::ingestion (most common), coughed up and swallow (Rhodococcus pneumonia), systemic blood-borne infections, parasite migration

How does the oral cavity protect against infections
?
Structure:
- Stratified squamous epithelium - high rate of epithelial turnover
- Taste buds
Resident flora: competitive attachment
Innate immunity:
- Secreted immunoglobulins
- Phagocytes and other effector cells within submucosa
Saliva:
- Flushing actions
- Contains lysozyme, lactoferrin, lactopreoxidase

What are the basic reactions of gastrointestinal tract?
Altered physiology (secretion, absorption and motility)
Cellular degeneration and necrosis
Inflammation
Cell proliferation  and neoplasia

What is the standard oral pathology you are looking for in the oral mucosa::smooth, shiny, pink

What are some other apperance of mucous membrane colour and the condition it implies
?
| Colour      | cause                    |
| ----------- | ------------------------ |
| White       | Anaemia                  |
| Red         | Inflamation (hyperaemia) |
| Yellow      | Jaundice                 |
| Blue/purple | Cyanosis                 |

What are some abnormalities in the facial cleft::Palatoschisis (cleft palate), Cheiloschisis (cleft lips)

What are some abnormalities in the mandible/maxilla
?
Brachygnathia inferior (short mandible) *Overshot*
Brachygnathia superior (short maxilla) *Undershot*
Prognathia inferior (long mandible)
Prognathia superior (long maxilla)
Agnathia (absence of mandible)
