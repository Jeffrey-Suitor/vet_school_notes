# IVP - AH1 - Cattle + Sheep Behaviour and 

## Cattle handling
* Herding instinct influences cattle behaviour
* A cow in front keeps cows moving forward
* Cow prefer to be moved in groups
* Cow move slower than humans
* Cows do not like to be rushed

## The flight zone

* Flight zone is the comfort zone
* Size of flight zone can vary animal to animal
* Agitated animals have a larger flight zone
* Herds also have flight zones
* Use the flight zone to move cows
* When the flight zone is entered the cow will move away
* When the flight zone is exited the cow will stop
* Move in and out of the flight zone to steer cows
* Entering and leaving the flight zone is pressure and release
* Most effective to continuously enter and leave the flight zone
* Use the least amount of pressure necessary to keep animals calm and safely moving

The point of balance is the point which determines which direction cattle will move. It is located behind the shoulder planes and down the centreline of the body.
