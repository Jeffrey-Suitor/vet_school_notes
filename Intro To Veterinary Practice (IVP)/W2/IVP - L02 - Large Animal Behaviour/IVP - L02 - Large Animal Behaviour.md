# IVP - L2 - Large Animal Behaviour
## Intended Learning Outcomes
* Describe the principles of normal behaviour in large animal species including cattle, sheep and horses
* Apply an understanding of the normal behaviour of large animal species in order to interpret their interactions with humans
* Describe the behavioural husbandry requirements for large animal species and explain environmental influences on their behaviour

## Large Animal Behaviour

What are some commonalities between sheep, cattle, and horses
?
* Graze most of the day
* Live in herds
* They are prey animals

What does grazing behaviour mean
?
* Walking long distances at a slow pace
* Feed intake over a long period
* Ruminating (Resting standing or laying down)
* Mainly live in open spaces, no place to hide so they flee

Describe some common aspects of living in a herd
?
- Herd structure which complex hierarchies representing relationships between group members
- Groups of females with offspring
- Social behaviour
- Body Language and vocalizations to communicate
- Safety for a herd is found in large numbers particularly at the centre of the herd

What are some common behavioural aspects of prey animals
?
- "Fight or flight" instinct is very strong
- Prey animals tend to have a strong flight response
- They tend to use escape and avoidance of conflict
- They tend to be highly vigilant when unsure
- If they cannot flee they will flight 

## Cattle Behaviour

Describe who was the ancestor of cattle and what year did they go extinct and describe their general behaviour
?
Auroch (Bos primigenius), 1627 was when they went extinct
Large horns and males were particularly aggressive

What two subspecies of cattle were domesticated, where, and about when did it occur
?
zebu cattle (Bos indicus) in South Asia
European cattle (Bos taurus) in Eurasia
9000 years ago

T/F most cows in Australia are pure bred::False, most are crossbreeds

List 3 beef cattle breeds::Angus, Hereford, Charolais

List 2 dairy cattle breeds::Holstein, Jersey

Order the following cattle from most aggressive to least aggressive,  beef cattle, dairy cattle, Bos Indicus cattle,::Bos Indicus, beef cattle, and dairy cattle

T/F Beef cattle bulls are considered more dangerous than dairy cattle bulls::False, dairy cattle bulls are considered more dangerous than beef cattle bulls

Aside from breed name two other factors that can impact temperament::age and previous experience

Describe herd behaviour in cattle and why cattle live in herds
?
Cattle live in herds to provide safety in numbers (feel danger when isolated)
Living in a herd makes it easier to find food, water, and shelter
Cattle are not territorial but have a home range
Natural herds consist of females and their offspring
Adult males live in bachelor groups
They have a complex social structure and hierarchies with little aggression
There is affiliative behaviour between individuals and special bonds

Describe grazing behaviour in cattle
?
They will often graze in the morning and the late afternoon
Spent 10-14 hours lying (resting, ruminating)
It is a synchronized behaviour amongst all animals in the herd. If one does something the others will follow
The milking also greatly affects the schedule of dairy cattle with the most common pattern being a twice day milking

Describe how cows sense the world
? 
Cows have a 300 degree vision
Sensitive to movement so that they can escape quicker
Their ears are able to rotate to the direction of sound
Smell and vocalizations are important senses and may be used to communicate when separated or if there is danger
Most social communication is done through body language such as facial expressions.
Ear, head, tail, body position and movements are used to communicate
Facial expressions may indicate emotions, look for wrinkling under the eye, whites of the eyes, drooping of ears

Describe the signs of aggression in cattle
?
Threats (staring, head tossing, foot stamping)
Aggression mainly head butting, can be deadly with horned cattle (sometimes charging)
May charge when they perceive a threat (such as a dog)
Kicking or striking can be either aggressive or defensive
Escape attempts when fearful is dangerous for both humans and the animal

What are some important considerations when handling cattle
?
Be aware of the point of balance
Move animals in groups
Use as little pressure as possible, give them time
Use food to help guide animals
Watch their body language for signs of fear or threatening behaviour

## Sheep Behaviour

What are sheep descended from when did it appear and when did wooly sheep appear and where
?
Sheep are descended from the mouflon which was in Mesopotamia 10 000 years ago and the modern wooly sheep was found 4000 years later

Why was the mouflon a good choice for domestication::Mouflon have a lack of aggression, compact size, early sexual maturity, social nature, and high reproduction rates

Describe the group behaviour in sheep
?
Sheep are gregarious although there are differences amongst breeds
They tend to stay close together during times of danger and disperse when grazing
Social facilitator of behaviour (once a few start doing something the rest will follow)
Sheep have a strong leader, follower behaviour

Describe the flock behaviour in sheep
?
Sheep live in flocks
These flocks have complex social hierarchies that are most evident when resources are scarce
Sheep have home ranges as well as specific bedding grounds where they sleep usually in a location with a good vantage point so that they can survey for predators
Natural grazing behaviour can see them travel 8 to 16 km per day depending on food and water availability
The preferred grazing times are early morning and late afternoon

Describe the social hierarchy in sheep
?
Complex social hierarchy with little aggression
Oldest ewe is often dominant, pushing rather than fighting
Stomping leg can be a threat, and lowering head and head shake a sign of submission
May lower head and rush subordinates
Vocalizations are mainly used for social reinstatement
Goats are more aggressive than sheep and use their horns
Goats rear heads when rushing opponent
When sheep and goats are mixed and fight, sheep often win

Describe the handling practices for sheep
?
Isolation is a highly stressful experience for sheep
Use of dogs also causes stress for sheep
Move sheep in groups with gentle movements
Food can be used to entice them
Use confinement to help guide the sheep
Drafting gates can be used to draft off selected sheep

## Horse Behaviour

Describe the history of horses
?
Eohippus angustidens was the ancestor found in heavy forest in North America
Evolved from a browser to a grazer
Equus evolved about 4 millions years ago and is the forefather of horses, zebras, and asses
Equus caballus is the modern horse which was widespread throughout Europe and Asia
Przewalski's horse, Tarpan, and European forest horse are direct ancestors of the modern horse

Describe the domestication of horses
?
Started 6000 years ago in multiple places at multiple times
Large genetic variation in the breeds
Horses weren't used for transport and riding until much later

Describe the social structure of horses
?
Large herds with sub groups (bands), consisting of mares and offspring with one or two stallions
Other males live in bachelor bands
They have a complex social hierarchy
Grazing (walking slowly) most of the day
They are able to sleep standing up
Minimal aggression in well established groups

Describe communication in horses
?
They are very receptive to body language including ear and tail position, facial expressions, and vocalizations
Mutual grooming for social cohesion
Threats can be head toss or head extension, ears back, state, lifting a leg, biting
Submission can shown by lowering head, looking away
They have near 360 vision and are built primary for flight

Describe the management of horses
?
Horses are a herd animal and should be kept with at least one companion
Horses naturally walk and graze all day so they should be provided with enough exercise and frequent meals
Stomach ulcers and stereotypic behaviour (weaving, cribbing, fence walking) are often seen when management is lacking

Describe the handling of horses
?
Handle in a location where the horse feels safe
Be aware of the very strong flight instinct
Pay attention to the body language and their ears
Stay calm and keep the horse calm
Don't get in a fight with them

Describe the training of horses
?
Understanding the training principles of horses will help you as a veterinarian to understand them
Horses learn from release of pressure
If you apply pressure, only release at a desirable moment. Anytime pressure is released it will train the horse good or bad
The principles applies to any training we do with horses and anytime we interact with them
