# Safety in EMS

mostly fairly simple but we should assess in advance

Risk varies between enterprises. Large animal properties include vehicles, etc.

Risk = likelihood x severity

If an event occurs once every 10 years but always results in death is a serious issue. Monthly require hospitalization is also a serious issue

We want to reduce frequency and severity

Important to research in advance

Make sure you aware of where the emergency equipment is, first aid kit location. 

What 3 words or some other emergency app. Allows people to easily locate you,

It's important to make sure people know your location

Always carry a basic medical kit with you in case you need it 

Ensure you know what facilities are available on the enterprise, where they are and how you can access them if you need to (no time to be checking this if trying to solve an emergency)

Location of nearest medical assistance

Before you go to any enterprise you should complete basic industry understanding research

Identify the main industry OHS/EHS issues before you visit any enterprise

On arrival at property work with enterprise manager/instructor to understand likely risks prior to undertaking work

Consider the type of animals you are working with and likely associated risks e.g. sheep jumping out end of race, cattle moving in raceway, dog/cat/bird bites, machinery injury

A serious risk can be in travel to enterprises

General car travel

Gravel roads

Long distance - TAKE A BREAK EVERY 2 hours (at least) and keep hydrated (no alcohol)

Drive at speed for road conditions NOT speed signs

Unsealed road surfaces include gravel, sand, or dirt. These surfaces can make your tires lose traction with the road. You should decrease your speed when travelling on these roads and increase the distance between you and the vehicle in front. 

Weather can also affect driving conditions on unsealed roads. Some examples of how weather affects your driving include:
- dry weather can create dusty conditions and limit your visibility
- wet weather can make roads muddy, slippery, and boggy

Defensive or safe driving courses are valuable tools to keep you safe when driving (whenever you may drive)

Worthwhile investment if you intend to drive during your career (even if only a short commute to work)

Range of courses available

The number culprit for injury on farms is machinery (tractors and ATVs), hydraulic loaders etc.

FEL (front end loader), found at front

PTO (Power Take Off), found at back of tractor

Auger (Giant screw)

Important to make sure everything is properly tied back

Careful with ATVs as they can also cause injuries

Careful of power lines which can potentially hit the power lines

Before you use ANY item of equipment you need to know how it works so you can anticipate any of the most likely dangers e.g. never standing under FEL in case hydraulic pressure fails

You should read AND understand any chemical labels that you are using AND apply any safety directions e.g. wearing gloves and full chemical suit where label says so. Instructions are there for a reason

If yards aren't well constructed they can cut you, make sure gates are closed, latches work, never stand with back to gate

Silo it's important to make sure there is sufficient air and other people there for fear you run out of air inside the silo

Pesticides can also be poisonous so be aware if getting into a silo

Hay bails can fall on people and kill them

Power lines are again critical to be knowledgeable of 

Water storage and water courses can also be lethal. Be aware of irrigation channels

Livestock and plant chemicals we should be aware of

Knowing MSDS and pubcris links

READ package inserts PRIOR to use, follow safety directions

Know where nearest medical centre is and time to get there

We appropriate protective gear AS PER DIRECTION

Learn animal behaviour really well, it will keep you and others safe. Use ALL of your sense ie. Don't be watching your phone in stock yards or wear ear piece

Don't underestimate small animals (you get a really nasty bite from a Chihuahua or more particularly a cat)

Watch stock BEFORE entering yards, this should tell you a about the herd/flock

Always check yard handling areas before using, ensure safe/solid

Are vaccinations needed prior (working with bats)

Are there an potential zoonoses (Q fever)

Reducing likelihood = standard prevention, wash hands before eating, reduce contamination

Sunburn and heat stroke

Hypothermia

Longer term sunburn = skin cancer (slip slop slap seek slide)

There is a variety of noise sources which can injure your hearing, engines, shearing plant, tractor, other, measure DB to check if ear plugs should be used
