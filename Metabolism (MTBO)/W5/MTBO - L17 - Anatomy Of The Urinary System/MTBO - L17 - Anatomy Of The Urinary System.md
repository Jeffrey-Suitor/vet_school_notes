Ventral to sublumbar muscles
On either side of the vertebral column
Partially medial to caudal ribs
Retro peritoneal and aren't strictly within the abdominal cavity
Right is usually a bit more cranial and is more solidly anchored compared to the left
Covered by peri renal fat

Ureters pass along the dorsal abdominal wall before descending
Eventually towards the bladder ureter passed on either side of the descending colon and in females passes through the broad ligament on either side of the reproductive tract
Enter the dorsal aspect of the caudal part of the bladder

Bladder when empty lies mostly within the pelvic cavity in larger animals and projects into the abdomen in carnivores
As it fills it moves increasingly cranial
Bladder lies ventral to the uterus and vagina and to the termination of the different ducts in the male

The urethra is a single tube that extends caudally from the neck of the bladder
In female animal the urethra is intra-pelvic only and lies ventral to the cervix and vagina
In the male the urethra is intra pelvic and within penis

Functional unit of the kidney is the nephron 
Nephron begins at renal corpuscle which is location where blood is filtered and urine formed
Urine modified as it passes along tube
Drains at the papillary duct at the tip of the papillar or the renal crest into the pelvis also called the calix
Renal corpuscle located in the cortex which includes
- Glomerulus which is a group of capillaries enclosed by the glomerular capsule. Blood enters via the efferent arteriole and branches from the interlobular artery that is located within the renal cortex

```pdf

```
Blood flows from the vascular blood down from the afferent arterial and passes through the capillaries and leaves via the efferent arteriole
As the blood passes through the capillaries it is filtered comprised of 
- Endothelial cells
- Basement membrane
- Membrane that bridges the slits between the particles of the podocytes which are on the outer aspect of the capillaries and form the visceral layer of Bowman's capsule
- Bowman's capsule has an outer layer of parietal epithelium and an inner layer formed by the podocytes. 
- Between inner and outer layers of the glomerular capsule is the urinary space, so when blood is filtered the urine is formed in the urinary space

First part of nephron is the proximal convoluted tubule

```pdf
'url': './MTBO - L17 - Slides.pdf'
"page": 33
```
Proximal convoluted tubule
Proximal straight tubule (descending thick limb)
thin descending limb of Henle's loop 
Thin ascending limb of Henle's loop 
Thick ascending limb of Henle's loop 
Distal convoluted tubule (begins where it comes close to the vascular pole of renal corpuscle) 
At the junction, ascending thick limb and distal convoluted tubule is the macula densa (within the distal convoluted tubule) which is part of the juxtaglomerular apparatus
Cortical collecting tubule
Initial collecting tubule
The collecting duct starts in the cortex and moves into the medulla. Joins other ducts to drain at the papillary duct in the cribriform area of the papillae which drains urine into the pelvis/calyx

Nephrons are classified according to the location of a renal corpuscle and the length of the loop of Henle. 
- Superficial are located near the outer cortex and lack a thin ascending limb. Only penetrated the outer part of the nephron
- Juxamedullary nephrons have long loops with long thin ascending limb. Penetrate into the inner medulla. Long loops are associated with countercurrent exchange between nephron and vas erecta capillaries. Responsible for the concentration of urine
- Mid Cortical nephrons that may a have a short or a long loop. 

Animals with a greater ability to concentrate urine have a greater percentage of long-loop nephrons

Juxtaglomerular cells act as baroreceptors and secret renin when blood pressure falls. Renin acts via RAAS to increase blood pressure
Macula densa at the junction of the distal straight tubule and the distal convoluted tubule. Act as chemoreceptors for sodium chloride and trigger vasoconstriction thereby reducing blood flow to the glomeruli and decreasing the glomerular filtration rate. Also exert influence on renin secretion via the juxtaglomerular cells
Extraglomerular mesangium is located outside the glomeruli between the distal tubule and the glomeruli. Function not entirely established but they also secrete renin

The renal arteries supply the kidney. It branches in the region of the hilum into the interlobar arteries and these pass either side of the lobes in the medulla towards the Cortico Medullary junction.

These then branch in the arcuate arteries and these arteries arch over the base of the medullary pyramid

Interlobular arteries arise from arcuate arteries and penetrate the cortex and ascend towards the capsule of the kidney

Renal veins are just reversed

A renal artery from the aorta
Interlobar arteries pass radially through the medulla around each of the lobes
Afferent arterioles arise from the interlobular arteries
Interlobular arteries continue towards the outer surface of the cortex to end as the stellate arteries

Afferent -> Glomerulus -> Efferent and then branches into the capillary network that surrounds the nephron tubules within the cortex

Straight arterioles also called descending vasa recta arise from the efferent arterioles. Can also arise from arcuate or interlobular arteries. Form capillary networks around straight tubules within the medulla and participate in the countercurrent exchange within the loops of the nephron.

Penis drainage operates under a similar pattern with the cortical capillaries drain directly or via interlobular veins to the arcuate veins and then via interlobular veins  to the arcuate veins and then interlobular veins to the renal vein.

In the medulla and the capillaries enter into straight venules and are called the ascending vasa recta and these drain into arcuate veins and finally into the interlobar veins in the capsule

Capsular capillaries in most species drain to the subcapsular or stellate veins. The exception is the cat which has capsular veins that drain on the outside surface of the kidney directly to the renal vein at the region of the hilum of the kidney. Renal vein drains to caudal vena cava

As a result of the blood vessels of the cortex, the renal cortex can be seen to be composed of subdivisions called lobules. Hence called interlobular

The cortical lobules comprises a medullary ray centrally surrounded circumferentially by the cortical labyrinth

Medullary rays are groups of parallel straight tubules running through the cortex towards the capsule

The structure of the ray mimics that of the renal medulla. The tubules of the medulla array of one lobule comprise the straight tubules of all the nephrons and surrounding and supplying a single collecting duct.

The cortical labyrinth surrounds the medullary ray and consists of the convoluted tubules and the renal corpuscle. The cortex has a granular appearance due to the presence of the renal corpuscle and the convoluted tubules.

Interlobular arteries arise from the arcuate arteries and indicate the boundaries of the renal lobules

Ureter is initially located along the room of the abdominal cavity. Descends through the broad ligaments in the female and it passes dorsal to the ductus defrens. Then it passes through the collateral ligaments into the dorsal aspect of the bladder

Ureter enters obliquely through the bladder wall
This creates a mucosal flap valve which via pressure in the bladder prevents the reflex of urine into the ureters. The Ureter opening is the ureter orifice

Body is main portion, neck leads into urethra, transitional epithlium, there are 3 layers of smooth muscle but not distinct and are called the detrusor muscle. 
Ureteric columns are mucosal ridges
Trigone is bounded by ureteric openings and the apex of the triangle is where the folds converge at the urethral crest

3 ligaments attach to the body and neck region leaving the apex free to expand cranially

The median ligament extends from the ventral midline of the bladder to attach to the linea alba and as far cranially as the umbilicus

Lateral ligaments originate on the lateral aspect of the body and neck and have round ligaments in their cranial margin

Uracus is a foetal structure and is a tube that extends from the apex of the bladder through the umbilical cord and it carries urinary wastes to one of the placental farts, the structure that closes over before birth. Vestige may be visible at the center of the apex of the bladder.

The urethralis muscle has two layers, a longitudinal and a circular layer which begins distal to the bladder neck to surround the pelvic urethra

The outer layer of connective tissue of the urethra is the adventitia

The urethra in female opens in the vestibule. The external urethral orifice opens in the vestibule in the female

Ductus deferens and the ducts of accessory glands such as the prostate gland open in the pelvic urethra. The urethra continues through the penis to open at the external urethral orifice at the tip of the penis.

The os penis is not part of ungulates but there is an os penis. In dogs, this is important because the shape means there is a urethral groove through which the urethra passes. This means that the urethra cannot expand inside the bone. This makes it prone to bladder stone blockage and restricts the size you can use for a catheter in the male dog.
