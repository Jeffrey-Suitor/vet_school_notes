- Explain the enterohepatic circulation of biliary constituents

## MTBO - L02

What is the role of the liver?
?
Largest gland in the body
Detoxification, biotransformation, synthesis, storage, phagocytosis
Capable of considerable regeneration

What is the output of the liver::Hepatic vein

T/F the liver slows down blood flow::True

Outline the histology of the liver
?
Uniform histology across species
Outer connective tissue capsule
Little connective tissue
The framework of connective tissue around lobules supports the liver parenchyma

What are the cells in the liver and their function
?
hepatocyte - all metabolic and toxicological except red blood cell phagocytosis, cuboidal to hexagonal, central nucleus and nucleolus, has a complete set of cell components, has microvilli, much larger than red blood cells
endothelial cell - fenestrated, incomplete barrier, allows plasma to trickle in
Kupffer cell - macrophages, lining sinusoids, phagocytosis of debris, old RBCs (aphete)
Sinusoids - Channels that allow blood to flow past
Bile canaliculi - 
Perisinusoidal - 

Outline the structure of the hepatocytes
?
A plate of hepatocytes interposed between hepatic sinusoids

What is the role of Stellate (Ito) cells
?
pericytes found in the perisinusoidal space, produce collage

What are the 3 parenchyma units in the liver
?
Classical lobule
Portal lobule
Liver acinus
Based on structural or functional concepts

Outline the classic liver lobule
?
The basic structural unit of the liver
hexagonal in shape
Central vein at the centre of the hexagon
Portal triads at the periphery of the hexagon
Portal triads at the periphery of the hexagon
- Portal vein
- Hepatic artery
- Bile duct
Cords of hepatocytes radiate from the central vein
Sinusoids extend between the cords of hepatocytes
- Lined by endothelial cells
- Kupffer cells - phagocytic cells
- Blood flows in a centripetal direction - to the central vein

T/F the liver central vein has no smooth muscle::True

T/F the liver central vein is fenestrated::True

T/F the hepatic arteriole is smaller than the vein in the portal triad::True

What type of cell is the bile duct::Cuboidal, epithelial

How do you tell a bile duct from a vein::Vein has blood inside

T/F blood and bile flow in the same direction::False, they flow in the opposite direction

What is the bile canaliculi::Small channel between hepatocytes, with tight junctions

Outline the portal lobule
?
Functional secretory unit
- Drains bile
Triangular in shape
- The boundary is defined by lines between the central veins of 3 adjacent classical lobules
- The Bile ductule is its central axis
Bile flow from the classical lobule to the central bile duct

What is the role of the liver acinus
?
Functional unit: blood supply to the hepatocytes
Diamond-shaped
The boundary is defined by drawing lines between 2 adjacent central veins via the portal triads

LEARN HOW TO DRAW THIS

Outline the structure of the bile ducts
?
Convey bile to the common bile duct and gall bladder
Add bicarbonate to bile
Interlobular - part of the portal triad, join to form hepatic ducts
Epithelial lining: Cuboidal -> Columnar
Larger ducts: outer connective tissue with elastic fibres

What is the role of the gallbladder
?
Stores and concentrates bile
Active resorption of Na across Gb epithelium (draw water with it)
The sphincter of Oddi regulates duodenal bile duct opening
Emptying of GB in response to food
Horses, rate, elephants and some deer lack a gallbladder
These species are able to upregulate bile production when required

What is the composition of the gall bladder histologically
?
Simple columnar epithelium
Mucosal crypts - small epithelial diverticula
No muscularis mucosa
Loose connective tissue lamina propria / submucosa
Muscularis externa - bundles of muscle fibres, random orientation
Tunica serosa

What the constituents and functions of bile
?
From hepatocytes:
- Bile salts
- Cholesterol
- Lecithin
- Bile pigments (bilirubin)
Bicarbonate (ductal cells)
Aids absorption and digestion of far
Excretion from the liver

LEARN RBC DESTRUCTION PATHWAY

Globin -> amino acids
Heme -> Iron -> Recycled
Heme -> Bilirubin -> Bile

Outline the production of bilirubin
?
Haem proteins (myoglobin, cytochromes (20-25%)
Haemoglobin (70-80%)
Haem oxygenase -> biliverdin
Biliverdin reductase -> bilirubin
Bilirubin binds to albumin in the blood (unconjugated bilirubin)
Bilirubin acts as an antioxidant

Outline bilirubin processing
?
![[Screenshot 2023-07-28 at 22.23.31.png]]

What is jaundice::Build up of bilirubin?

Outline bilirubin excretion
?
Bilirubin -> Urobilinogen -> Urobilin -> urine
Stercobilinogen -> Stercobilin -> Faeces

How will faeces appear with no bilirubin::Pale, sticky
