## Intended Learning Outcomes
- Describe the processes by which energy is derived from carbohydrates, fats and proteins
- Outline the key biochemical processes that occur in the liver
- Relate the regulatory effects of insulin and glucagon to what occurs in post-prandial and fasted states
- Describe the metabolic fates of acetyl-CoA

## MTBO - L03

What is the purpose of metabolism?
?
Chemical processes in the body that sustains life
- Oxidation of food to provide energy (ATP)
- Food molecules converted into new cellular material
- Processing of waste products to facilitate excretion
- Generation of heat
The liver is central to these processes

60% of glucose used by the brain

What are the constituents of food
?
Carbohydrates - Sugars mostly as disaccharides (sucrose, lactose) or polysaccharides (starch)
Fats - Triacylglycerols (TAGs)
Proteins - Polypeptides of amino acids
Vitamins (cofactors, essential if not synthesised)
Mineral (cofactors,)
Fibre (indigestible)
Water

Summarize the postprandial state
?
High levels of nutrients in the blood
Glucose
- Replenish glycogen stores in the liver and skeletal muscle
- Excess converted to TAGs
Fats
- TAG stored in adipocytes
Amino Acids
- Utilised by tissues for de novo protein synthesis
- Excess converted to fat or glycogen

Outline the hormonal control of metabolism
?
Insulin
- Main signal to store
- Pancreatic B cells in response to high glucose
- Drives glucose into the liver, uptake of TAGs, uptake of amino acids
Glucagon
- Main signal to release
- Pancreatic alpha cells in response to low glucose
Reciprocal control

Outline the energy release from food
?
Energy is derived from glucose, fat, and amino acids in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP)
Glucose 6 phosphate -> pyruvate -> acetyl CoA

Outline the energy release from glucose
?
Glucose or other sugars as 'glucose-like' substrates
Stored as glycogen in liver and skeletal mm

What is the first stage of glucose breakdown
?
Cytoplasmic
Splitting of glucose (6C) -> 2x pyruvate (3C) 2 ATP, 2 NADH
Does not require O2

What is the second stage of glycolysis
?
TCA cycle
Mitochondrial matrix
First step
- Oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate
  - Irreversible release of CO2
- Acetyl group 2C transferred to carried Coenzyme A to acetyl CoA

Outline acetyl-CoA
?
Coenzyme A is an acyl group carrier
Incorporates pantothenic acid (Vitamin B5)
Acetyl-CoA is at a crossroads of metabolism
There are 3 fates of acetyl-CoA
- Feed into TCA
- Lipogenesis
- Ketogenesis

What are the significant elements of the TCA cycle?
?
GTP produced
NADH, FADH2
2 C02 as waste products

What is the third stage of glucose breakdown
?
Oxidative phosphorylation
AKA electron transport chain
Electrons from NADH/FADH2 "bump down a staircase"
- Each fall releases energy
- O2 is the final electron acceptor

Outline aerobic cellular respiration
?
Oxygen is required as a final electron acceptor in ETC
Although oxygen is not utilised directly in the TCA cycle, the availability of NAD+ becomes limiting when oxygen is not present

Outline anaerobic cellular respiration
?
Anaerobic glycolysis: pyruvate -> lactate
Lactate sustains glycolysis:
- Yields only 2 ATP per glucose
- 100x speed of oxidative phosphorylation

Outline the lactic acid cycle
?
Lactate is released from tissues and transported to the liver
Lactate converted to glucose (requires energy)

Outline energy from fats
?
Free fatty acids
C atoms detached 2 at a time as acyl group -> acetyl-CoA -> TCA cycle
Fatty acid oxidation differs from glucose oxidation in the preliminary formation of acetyl-CoA

Outline the role of the liver in fatty acid metabolism
?
Can utilise fatty acids as energy (B oxidation)
Lipogenesis / TG synthesis
Package TAGs with apoproteins as VLDL

Outline the fat of glycerol
?
Directed to the liver or kidneys to be converted to glycolytic intermediates -> feeds into glycolysis
Often considered negligible

Outline the fate of amino acids
?
Amino acids proteins
C-H skeletons -> NH2 group removed to Urea
- Lipids or lipid derivatives
- Oxidation
- Glucose

Outline the energy release from amino acids
?
Deamination via transaminase
C-H skeletons used as fuel
- Pyruvate (Alanine)
- Acetyl-CoA (Lysine)
- TCA cycle intermediates
Amino acids can be glucogenic, ketogenic, or both

What is gluconeogenesis
?
Most reactions opposite of glycolysis
Glucose production from non-carbohydrate substrates
- Glycerol
- Lactate, pyruvate
- Gluconeogenic amino acids (alanine, glutamine)
- Propionate - ruminants
Acetyl-CoA is not glucogenogenic
Mainly in liver (also in kidney)
