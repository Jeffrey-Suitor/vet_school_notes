# MTBO - L01 - Gross Anatomy of Liver

## Intended Learning Outcomes
- Describe the gross anatomy of the liver and its attachments to other structures and organs
- Compare the position and orientation of the liver, relative to the midline and the other cranial abdominal organs, in the main domestic species
- Relate the passage of the caudal vena cava and oesophagus to the dorsal part of the liver
- List the structures entering and exiting the liver at the portal region
- Describe the relationship of the gall bladder and bile duct system to the gross structure of the liver.
- Describe the development of the liver in the embryo

## MTBO - L01

Outline the position of the liver
?
The diaphragm cranially
The stomach and intestinal mass caudally
Bulk lies to the right in all species
Held in position by 
- Close attachment to the diaphragm
- The pressure of the viscera

T/F the liver can be palpated beyond the coastal arch on left side::False

T/F the liver can be palpated on the right side beyond coastal arch::True

What are the external features of the liver
?
Size and weight vary
- Carnivores - 3-5% body weight
- Omnivores -2-3% body weight
- Herbivores - 1-1.5% body weight
Reddish brown in colour but friable
Highly vascular
Covered by serosa and tunica fibrosa
Two surfaces
- Cranial (parietal) or diaphragmatic
  - Convex 
  - Faces to the left and right side and dorsally
  - Caudal or visceral surface
    - Concave
    - Contains the portal area
    - Faces mainly caudoventrally and to the left

What are the two external borders of the liver
?
Dorsal border
- Mid line - groove for caudal vena cava
- To the left of this - notch for the oesophagus
Ventral border
- Sharp-edged
- Notch for the round ligament (ligamentum teres)

What are the lobes of the dog liver
?
Left lateral
Left medial
Quadrate
Right medial
Right lateral
Caudate (caudate and papillary processes)

What are the ligaments of the liver 
?
Cranial surface of the liver to the diaphragm
- Coronary
- Falciform
- Right and left triangular
hepatorenal
Round ligament of the liver (ligamentum teres)
Lesser omentum 

Outline the gall bladder location
?
Not in horses, elephants, deer
Pear shaped
Partly fused to liver
Lies between the quadrate and right medial lobes
Diverticulum of bile duct
Bile flows two way in the cystic duct

Outline the bile duct system
?
Microscopic canaliculi
Larger ductules - few large hepatic ducts
Common hepatic duct - leaves portal area
Cystic duct - side branch
Bile duct or common bile duct
Major duodenal papilla

Outline the blood supply of the liver
?
Hepatic artery 0 branches of celiac - most of the O2
Portal vein 70-80 of the total blood supply
All blood is collected by a single set of veins
- Central veins of lobules
- Progressively larger hepatic veins
- Drain to caudal vena cava

Outline the nerve supply of the liver
?
Sympathetic
Parasympathetic

Outline the formation of the liver in the embryo
?
Diverticulum from the ventral surface of fore-gut at the junction of stomach/duodenum
Initially grows in the mesoderm of the septum transversum
Hepatocytes and bile duct system are endoderms derived

Comparative aspects of the liver (DOG)
?
Relatively large
Almost entirely within the coastal area
R;L proportion ~ 3:2
Deeply divided into 5/6 lobes
Gall bladder
- Sunk deep between quadrate/R medial lobes
- R of the median plane
- Appears at the visceral surface
- Common bile duct opens
  - On major duodenal papilla 5-8 cm distal to pylorus
  - in conjunction with the pancreatic duct

Outline the liver of the horse
?
Small proportion 
The long axis is oblique
2/3 lies to the right of the median plane
The dorsal border-left part does not extend as far dorsally as the right

What are the lobes of the liver of the horse
?
Left
Quadrate
Right Caudate
Hepatorenal ligament - attaches the liver to the base of the caecum as well as the right kidney

Outline the comparative aspect of the horse bile system
?
No gall bladder
Bile duct opens
- 13-15 cm distal to pylorus
- On the major duodenal papilla
  - Hepatopancreatic ampulla
  - In conjunction with the pancreatic duct

Which animal has the least amount of liver tissue on the left side::Ox

Outline the comparative aspects of the cow liver
?
Contact with right abdominal wall 7th rib - last rib
Largely covered by lung
Maybe palpated in cranial R. paralumbar fossa
Lies almost entirely to R of midline
Rotated 90% in embryo
- Right lobe - dorsal
- Left lobe -ventral
Gall bladder
- Piriform shape
- Projects beyond the lateral margin of the right lobe
Bile duct opens
- In 2nd bend of the sigmoid flexure
- About 60cm on the major duodenal papilla
- Alone on the major duodenal papilla

Outline the comparative aspects of the pig liver
?
Resembles dog in position and lobation
4 major lobes + short quadrate + caudate 
- No papillary process
The high content of interlobular connective tissue - speckled appearance on the liver surface (Morocco leather)
The Bile duct opens alone 2.5-5cm from the pylorus

Outline the comparative aspects of the avian liver
?
Liver
- Dark brown in adult
- Lobes of liver embrace caudal portion of heart
Bile ducts
- Two bile ducts - open from each lobe
- Enter the distal end of the duodenum
- Close to pancreatic ducts

How do we liver biopsy a standing horse
?
Shoulder + elbow + iliac tuberosity creates a triangle and you avoid the area of the lungs

T/F a horse cannot be biopsied standing::False
