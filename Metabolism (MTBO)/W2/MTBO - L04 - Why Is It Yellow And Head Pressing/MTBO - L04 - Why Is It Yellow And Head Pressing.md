# MTBO - L04 - Why Is It Yellow And Head Pressing

## Intended Learning Outcomes

- Recognise the clinical signs that are suggestive of hepatobiliary disease in herbivorous and carnivorous domestic
animals
- Explain the pathogenesis of these clinical signs

## MTBO - L04

T/F Liver disease can be immediate or take a long time to present::True

T/F liver failure is often irreversible::True

T/F liver can accumulate secondary conditions::True, from right-sided heart failure and gastrointestinal disease

T/F liver disease is more common than liver failure::True because the liver is regenerative and has a large reserve capacity

T/F liver failure is only chronic::False, can be acute when caused by trauma such as by impact with the car in small animals

What are the 3 phases of liver metabolism::Pre-haptic, hepatic, post-hepatic, and jaundice can cause jaundice, and hepatic + post-hepatic are associated with cholestasis

What are some mechanisms that can cause pre-haptic biliary issues?
?
Hemolysis acceleration
- Paracetamol poisoning leading
- Can overwhelm hepatic capacity leading to jaundice
- Severe haemorrhage can also lead to pre-haptic jaundice

What are some mechanisms of hepatic biliary issues
?
Toxins, poisons
Bile salts kill hepatocytes leading to build up of hepatocytes


What are the 3 steps of hepatocyte processing
?
Uptake of unconjugated bilirubin
Smooth ER conjugates bilirubin
Secreted into bile canaliculi (most energy intensive, requires ATP, rate-limiting step, this is the step likely to be deserved)


What are the methods of extra-hepatic jaundice?
?
A tumour blocking the common bile duct
Visible as an accumulation of bile in portal areas, can lead to onion skinning fibrosis
Colour change in elastic fibres
Mild bilirubinemia can be too faint for us to detect

T/F multiple jaundice mechanisms can occur at once::True

T/F all yellow fat is jaundice::False

Outline hepatogenous photosensitisation
?
Only occurs in herbivores, bacteria in the GI tract
Non-pigmented skin is predisposed, poorly-haired, or sparsely haired
UV radiation from the sun is mechanistic
Itchy and animals will rub at it
Chlorophyll, philoripherine, conjugate it, and cholestasis can lead to the building up of these photosensitive elements, into sinusoids, in the general system
Seen at the skin because it reaches the skin, and is activated by UV, leading to oxidation
Can also occur without underlying issues if suddenly turned out at a very large pasture
Can see ventrally from reflected light

Outline hepatic encephalopathy
?
Porto systemic shunts in dogs
Head pressing, drooling, mental dullness, manic behaviour, vomiting, diarrhea, seizures

What is a portosystemic shunt
?
Diverting blood from liver into circulation
Can be congenital

What are some commons toxins that can cause hepatic encephalopathy
?
GI
- Ammonia - meant to go to the liver, urea cycle to urea, hyperaemia, astrocytes normally scavenge ammonia, can lead to a cytotoxic reaction, swelling of the nucleus, spongiform vacuolation in the white matter of the brain, cerebellum
- Mercaptans
- Short-chain fatty acids
- Skatoles
- Indoles
- Aromatic amino acids
- Gamma amino butyric acid
Octopamine
Tryptophan
Serotonin

Outline oedema caused by liver issues
?
Lack of albumin, produced by only hepatocytes, insufficient oncotic pressure to keep water in plasma, Hypoalbuminaemia
The most common type is abdominal oedema (ascites), driven by portal hypertension, which increases the resistance and forces fluid out
Failure of venous outflow to the heart, central veins
- Fluid is driven out leading to extrahepatic lymph
- Excess lymph pours into the abdominal cavity, modified transudate, +protein, low TNCC

What is polyuria and polydipsia?
?
Polydipsia -> Polyuria

Outline acholic faeces
?
Stercobilin gives faeces its colour
Acholic means lacking colour
Acholic is a complete hepatic obstruction
- Tumours
- Steatorrhoea

Outline how haemorrhage and thrombosis can be caused by liver
?
The liver is the source of clotting factors
Can be acute or clotting
Decreased synthesis can fail to clot
Thrombosis can be caused by the liver creating anti-clotting factors, anti-thrombin 3, plasminogen

Outline hepatorenal syndrome
?
Most often in dogs
Advanced liver disease, ascites, portal hypertension, cirrhosis
Liver failure leads to kidney failure, proximal tubular cells dying
Wet oedematous kidney failure in animals
Underprofussion leads to hypoxic insult to the kidneys

Outline how crystalluria
?
Made via a sediment smear
Most likely dog can be a cat
Underlying liver disease or portosystemic shunting
hyperammonemia +  hyperammonuria
Always a significant finding

What are some other clinical signs of liver disease
?
Failure to regulate blood glucose levels
Too blood low glucose levels or too high levels
Important in drug and toxin management, routine management, prolonged recovery period
Skin issues in dogs, underlying mechanism, abnormal keratine production, not common, not specific to liver
Lecaptive circulation causing a smell, more common in humans
Feminisation syndrome because of failure to regulate estrogen, gynecomastia, testicular atrophy
