# MTBO - L06 - Laboratory Investigation Of The Liver and Biliary System

## Intended Learning Outcomes

- Understand the principles of the total serum bile acids assay
- List the key laboratory findings associated with chronic liver disease and liver failure

## MTBO - L06

Outline the liver capacity
?
Marked reserve capacity and ability to regenerate
Liver failure/insufficiency occurs when more than 70-80% of the functional mass is lost
The liver fails to synthesise substances normally produced
The liver fails to clear the blood of substances normally eliminated or recycled

Outline the assessment of hepatic function
?
Urea synthesis
Cholesterol synthesis
Albumin synthesis
Glucose synthesis
Bilirubin conjugation
Bile acids uptake and excretion
Ammonia uptake and metabolism
Enzyme changes suggest the presence of hepatocellular damage and or cholestasis but don't assess function
Failure of liver function is identified when more than 70-80% of the functional mass is lost:
- Liver fails to synthesise substances normally produced:
  - Urea, cholesterol, albumin, glucose, coagulation factors
- The liver fails to clear the blood of substances normally eliminated or recycled by the liver
  - Bilirubin, bile acids, ammonia

How do we assess hepatic function?
?
Tests that indicate hepatic insufficiency (hepatic failure) DO NOT INDICATE
- Cause of liver dysfunction
- Prognosis for recovery

Detecting Liver Dysfunction
?
Other (non-specific) factors which can help evaluate hepatic insufficiency, especially chronic liver disease:
- Serum biochemistry
- CBC and erythrocyte morphology
- Urinalysis
- Coagulation proteins

What are some routine biochemistry clues for liver dysfunction?
?
Reduced synthesis of 
- Albumin - but long half-life (8d dogs, 19d horses)
- Urea - decrease conversion from ammonia
- Cholesterol - but may also be normal or increased, as cholestasis can result in hypercholesterolaemia
- Glucose - decrease glycogen stores and decrease gluconeogenesis

What are some haematological clues
?
Mild non-regenerative anaemia - anaemia of chronic disease
Mild microcytosis may be seen with PSS
Inflammatory leukogram - cholangiohepatitis, cholecystitis
Icteric plasma - hyperbilirubinaemia in cats and dogs
Hypoproteinaemia - reduced albumin synthesis

What is an acanthocyte
?
Seen with shear injury, and diseases which alter lipid composition.

What are the urinalysis clues?
?
Hyposthenuria (and PU/PD)
- Low urea and reduced medullary tonicity
Bilirubinuria
- Orange urine, bilirubin crystals and positive urine dipstick indicate hyperbilirubinaemia
Ammonia biurate crystals
- May be seen with PSS, hepatic dysfunction, Dalmatians and bulldogs

What are some coagulation disorders associated with liver dysfunction
?
Coagulation abnormalities are common in liver disease
- Prolonged APTT/PT times
Causes include
- Decreased synthesis of coagulation factors, platelet dysfunction and DIC
- Cholestasis results in reduced absorption of fat-soluble Vitamin K
Coagulation screening is recommended prior to liver FNA/biopsy

What are bile acids
?
Produced in the liver from cholesterol and  stored in the gall bladder (if present)
Undergo an efficient enterohepatic circulation 
- Released into the intestine
- Re-absorbed into the portal system 
- Extracted by hepatocytes

Outline the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids
?
Following food intake, bile acids are released into the duodenum
About 95% of the bile acids are reabsorbed in the ileum are released into the portal vein and redirected to the liver
Approximately 5% of the bile aid is lost through faecal output 
Only a small proportion escapes the enterohepatic circulation and reaches the systemic circulation

What is the Bile acid assay 
?
Causes of increased serum bile acids: 
- Decreased function hepatic mass (impaired extraction of sBA from the portal blood)
 Portosystemic vascular malformations (MVD, PSVA/PSS)
- Portal blood by-passes the liver and thus reduces extraction (esp. post prandially)
Cholestasis (retention and reflux of sBA back into circulation after bile stasis)
Sensitive and specific test of hepatic function (in the absence of cholestasis)
- PSS, steroid hepatopathy, neoplasia
Not useful to asses liver function in animals known to be cholestatic (hyperbilirubinemia)
Abnormal results do not determine aetiology severity or prognosis
- Indicates the need for diagnostic imaging, hepatic biopsy

What are the types of bile acids tests
?
Single sBA used in horses, camelids
Dynamic sBA used in dogs and cats:
- Two samples (pre and 2 hours postprandial)
- Increases sensitivity by challenging the liver capacity for BA extraction after gallbladder contraction
Insensitive test in ruminants

Outline the bile acids test protocol
?
Fast the patient for 12 hours
Collect the first blood sample and label the tube with the patient's name and pre or time-zero sample
Feed a small amount (2-4 tablespoons) of canned maintenance type diet (high-fat diet is NOT necessary)
Two hours after feeding, collect the second sample and label it with the patient's name and 2 hour
- Post-prandial bile acid concentrations > 31 micromolar/L (dogs) are suggestive of hepatobiliary disease. 15-31 cannot rule in or out

Outline microvascular dysplasia
?
Small breed dogs (terrier-type)
- High sBA may reflect either portosystemic shunt (PSS) or microvascular dysplasia (MVD)
  - Puppies with large shunts often require surgery
  - Whereas MVD is nota. surgical problem
- Ammonia levels may help further evaluate liver function
- **Protein C** values > 70% are expected with MVD, whereas a low value would support hepatic insufficiency (PSS)

Outline the ammonia test for liver
?
Ammonia concentration can be useful in further evaluating liver function
- Produced from exogenous or endogenous amino acids
- Taken up by the liver where most are converted to urea
- Urea enters circulation and is then excreted into the urine (and GIT system)
Measurement is problematic as it is very unstable
- Heparin anticoagulant preferred
- Separate plasma and analyse ASAP
- Must be kept chilled
- Hyperammonemia: a common symptom of liver failure
- Toxic accumulation of ammonia
- Hyperammonemia -> brain toxicity
- Coma and death

What conditions can lead to ammonia levels?
?
Elevated blood ammonia levels seen with:
- Incorrect sample handling 
- Portosystemic shunt
- Hepatic insufficiency (70% hepatic function lost)
- Overgrowth urease-producing bacteria
- Urea toxicosis in ruminants

How do we reach a final diagnosis?
?
Ultrasound 
Cytology - Useful to Dx sepsis, vacuolar change, and metastatic neoplasia. Less useful for Dx hepatitis, cirrhosis, hepatocellular tumours
Biopsy for histopathology - Often required for a definite diagnosis as allows evaluation of architecture
