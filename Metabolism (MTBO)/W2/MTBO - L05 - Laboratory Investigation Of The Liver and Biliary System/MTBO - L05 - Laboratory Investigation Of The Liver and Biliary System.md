What is a liver disease?
?
Includes any process that results in hepatocyte injury, cholestasis or both:
- Hypoxia
- metabolic disease
- Toxicity
- inflammation
- Neoplasia
- Trauma
- Congenital
- Bile duct blockage
Liver disease can be primary, or secondary, to disease processes in other tissues
- Pancreatitis
- Inflammatory bowel disease
Frequently presents as a diagnostic challenge and varied clinical signs
Can be detected with CBC, Biochemistry, Urinalysis
Other techniques include
- Liver function tests
- Endocrinology (TT4, ACTH stim test)
- Imaging (radiographs, ultrasound, CT scans)
- Cytology (effusion, FNA) or biopsy for histopathology

How do hepatocytes appear in health
?
Well demarcated
Distinct nucleolus
Lipofuscin filled with bile

How do we assess liver disease?
?
Evidence of cell damage -> increased enzyme damage
Evidence of cholestasis -> increased bilirubin, induction of enzymes
Evidence of hepatic insufficiency
- Decreased urea, cholesterol, albumin, glucose
- Increased unconjugated bilirubin
- Functional tests-  bile acids, ammonia
Is the liver disease likely primary or secondary - clinical findings, other test results

Outline damage markers of the liver
?
Cytosolic or mitochondrial enzymes
ALT (muscle)
GLDH
AST (muscle, RBC)
LDH (muscle, RBC)
SDH
Released due to membrane damage

Which will have more enzyme activity, acute sublethal injury or end-stage liver disease:: Acute sublethal

Outline the role of alanine aminotransferase (ALT)
?
Cytosolic enzyme - serum half-life of 3 days in dog and 3 hours in cat
Increased ALT is a major marker of hepatocellular injury in dogs and cats (rats, mice, primates)
- Less useful in rabbits as rises with another tissue injury
- Not useful in horses, ruminants and pigs due to low enzyme activity in liver tissue
Highest activity seen with acute or severe injury
- Trauma, necrosis, inflammation
Mild increases were seen with
- Anticonvulsants, corticosteroids, hyperthyroidism
ALT is also a cytosolic enzyme in skeletal myocytes
Mild increase in ALT may occur with severe myopathies
- Ischemic myopathy in cats, muscular dystrophy in dogs, snake envenomation
- Expect creatine kinase (CK) and AST to be high

Outline the role of Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)
?
Cytosolic and mitochondrial enzyme with half-life of 1 week in the horse, 1 day in dog, 1 hour in cat
AST is a useful indicator of hepatocellular injury in most species
- Horses and ruminants, useful as have minimal ALT
- Cats and dogs; a sensitive indicator of liver injury
AST is not as tissue-specific as ALT
- AST will increase with haemolysis (from erythrocytes)
- AST will increase with muscle damage (from myocytes)

Outline AST - muscle vs liver vs haemolysis
?
1. Check Creatine Kinase (CK)
- Muscle-specific enzyme
- Useful to differentiate the source of AST elevation
2. Check for haemolysis
- Haemolytic anaemia
- Invitro haemolysis

Outline the role of glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH)
?
Mitochondrial enzyme - requires greater damage to escape into serum
Half-life in horses is 12-24 hours and 14 hours in cattle
GLDH is a major marker of acute hepatocellular injury in all species
- Useful in large animals as more specific than AST
- Rarely used in cats and dogs (ALT considered superior)
- GLDH useful in birds and reptiles

Outline the role of sorbitol dehydrogenase (SDH)
?
Cytoplasmic enzyme
SDH is a useful marker of hepatocellular damage in horses and ruminants
- More commonly used in the USA
- However, enzyme stability is an issue - decreases rapidly in stored samples
Half-life 12-24 hours in horses

What are some diseases that cause liver enzyme elevations::hepatocellular carcinoma, hepatic trauma, liver necrosis / fasciolosis

Outline cholestasis
?
Reduced outflow of bile - impairment anywhere between hepatocytes and bile duct entry to the duodenum
Functional
- Defective or downregulated bile acid transporters, endotoxins (sepsis), excess-free FA (fasting)
Structural
- Hepatic - constriction of canaliculi (lipidosis, steroid hepatopathy, neoplasia, fibrosis, bile sludging)
- Post-hepatic - bile duct blockage (cholelithiasis, pancreatitis, neoplasia, mucoceles, inflammation)

Outline bile plugs or bile casts
?
tissue evidence of cholestasis
![[Screenshot 2023-07-29 at 13.47.39.png]]

What are the markers of cholestasis?
?
ALP
Corticosteroid ALP in dogs
GGT
Induced by cholestasis, drugs and hormones

What is hyperbilirubinemia
?
Bilirubin (normally excreted in bile) may spill over into blood (and urine) with severe cholestasis (hepatic or post-hepatic)
Also occurs with haemolysis (RBC lysis)

What is hypercholesterolemia
?
Decreased clearance
Non-specific (increase with endocrine disease, pancreatitis, post prandially)

Outline Alkaline phosphates (ALP)
?
Membrane-bound enzyme
Serum ALP represents total ALP activity, which includes three major isoforms
- L-ALP: liver (hepatocytes and biliary epithelium)
- B-ALP: bone (osteoblasts)
- C-ALP: corticosteroid (hepatocytes) DOG SPECIFIC
Additional ALP isoforms include
- Intestinal, leukocyte, renal, mammary and placental
- Short half-lives and do not typically increase serum ALP
- May see mild ALP elevations with mammary tumours, and late pregnant queens
- 
Outline how increased serum ALP is associated with cholestasis
?
Bile acid accumulation induces L-ALP synthesis
Dogs: high sensitivity for detecting cholestasis
- Increased ALP often precedes hyperbilirubinemia
- Lacks specificity due to C-ALP isoform
Cats: lower sensitivity but specific for cholestasis
- Produce less ALP and a very short half-life
- So any increase is considered significant
Large animals: poor sensitivity, wide ref interval (GGT preferred)

Outline how increased serum ALP is associated with increased osteoblastic activity
?
Induce B-ALP synthesis
- Young rapidly growing animals
- Osteosarcoma
- Fracture repair
- Active bone resorption
  - Hyperparathyroidism
  - Hyperthyroidism (also L-ALP)
Generally only mild increases in serum ALP (< 4x)

Outline other causes of increased serum ALP levels
?
Corticosteroids (dogs only)
- induce C-ALP from hepatocytes
- Source
  - Exogenous (therapeutic)
  - Endogenous (chronic stress or hyperadrenocorticism)
Anticonvulsants
- Increase L-ALP production in cats and dogs
  - Phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone (not shown to increase C-ALP)

Outline the role of gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT)
?
membrane-bound enzyme
The main source of GGT is the liver
- Especially biliary epithelium but also hepatocytes
- Also in the pancreas, kidney, intestine, epididymis (lost into lumens)
Colostrum also contains high levels of GGT
- Dogs, cats, sheep, cattle (but NOT HORSES)
- In neonates, decreased GGT may indicate failure of passive transfer
- Measurement of IgG is the gold standard
GGT is a sensitive indicator of cholestasis and/or biliary hyperplasia in all domestic species
- GGT more sensitive than ALP in ruminants and horses
  - Pyrrolizidine alkaloid toxicity in cattle
  - Cholelithiasis, cholangiohepatitis in horses
- GGT increases usually precede increases in ALP in cats
  - EXCEPTION: some cases of hepatic lipidosis (INCREASE ALP:GGT ratio is highly suggestive)
- GGT tends to be parallel ALP in dogs

How do we asses enzyme abnormalities
?
1. Identify the predominant pathologic process
  - Hepatocellular injury vs cholestasis
    - Increased enzyme activities cannot identify specific aetiology
    - Most diseases are a mix of both processes
2. Identify the magnitude of increased activity
  - May relate to the severity of damage (especially with cytoplasmic enzymes)
  - Does not differentiate between reversible or irreversible damage or local or diffuse damage
3. Identify the rate of change
  - Monitor changes over time to assess if process is active

How do we interpret serum enzymes
?
Enzyme activities have reference intervals but are usually described as fold increases to interpret the significance of magnitude
- Allows comparison of values between different analysers
Rule of thumb
- 2-3 fold increase above RI = mildly elevated
- 4-5 fold increase above RI = moderately elevated
- 10-fold increase above RI = markedly elevated

What is bilirubin and how do measure it
?
Yellow pigment derived largely from breakdown of haemoglobin by macrophages (spleen, liver, BM)
Normally constantly produced and rapidly removed from plasma by the liver
Elevated bilirubin is used as a marker of liver disease but can indicate haemolysis
Types of bilirubin
- Unconjugated (Bu)
- Conjugated (Bc)
- Delta bilirubin
- All 3 are total bilirubin (TBIL)

![[Screenshot 2023-07-30 at 10.01.44.png]]

Outline normal bilirubin metabolism
?
**Unconjugated bilirubin (Bu)** = indirect Bb. Produced from the degradation of heme from old red blood cells
Bound to albumin in the blood and transported to the liver
uptake by hepatocytes and conjugated to glucuronic acid
**Conjugated bilirubin (Bc)** = direct Bb. Water soluble and is excreted as a component of bile, into the intestine
Converted by intestinal bacteria to urobilinogen
- Stercobilin in faeces (brown colour to faeces)
- Urobilin in kidneys (yellow colour to urine)
In healthy **dogs**, a small amount of conjugated bilirubin spills into the urine (may see 1+ on urine dipstick), if the specific gravity is normal

Outline the mechanism of Icterus
?
Pre-hepatic (haemolysis)
Hepatic 
Post-hepatic (bile duct obstruction)
Jaundice = Icterus, the clinical presentation of hyperbilirubinemia
Hyperbilirubinemia is clinically evident as jaundice/icterus when > 35-50 micro molar/L

Outline pre-hepatic hyperbilirubinemia
?
Increased erythrocyte breakdown
The rate of Bu production exceeds the rate of uptake or excretion by hepatocytes, resulting in elevated TBIL
Usually due to severe rapid haemolysis
- immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia (IMHA), healthy liver can handle substantial haemolysis without an increase in bilirubin
Typically Bu > Bc, with no increase in liver enzymes
- However, hypoxic injury to hepatocytes or concurrent liver disease may complicate the pattern

What percentage of erythrocytes in a healthy patient should touch each other::50%

What are the key signs of anaemia on a blood smear
?
Anaemic - decreased red cell density
Ghost cells - support intravascular haemolysis
Spherocytes - support extravascular haemolysis
![[Screenshot 2023-07-30 at 10.11.23.png]]

Outline hepatic hyperbilirubinaemia
?
Elevated TBIL caused by abnormal uptake, conjugation or excretion of bilirubin by hepatocytes:
- Decreased functional hepatic mass
  - Chronic hepatitis, diffuse necrosis or neoplasia, end-stage liver disease
- Anorexia/fasting in **horses** (cattle, cats)
  - Mobilisation of fatty acids interferes with Bu uptake
- Sepsis
  - Inflammatory cytokines interfere with transporters
Typically mild elevations in bilirubin
- Bu may predominate but is dependent on the process

Outline post hepatic hyperbilirubinaemia
?
Increased TBIL caused by obstruction of bile flow
- Intrahepatic = compression of bile canaliculi
- Extrahepatic = compression/obstruction of bile ducts
Typically Bc > Bu (except horses)
- Hyperbilirubinaemia can be marked
- Expect increased ALP/GGT and bilirubinuria

Outline the species for hyperbilirubinaemia
?
Dogs: Elevations in ALP/GGT are more sensitive than elevations in bilirubin. Also have a low renal threshold for bilirubin so bilirubinuria precedes hyperbilirubinaemia
Cats: May see hyperbilirubinaemia before the increase in ALP/GGT. Bilirubinuria is always significant. Can see a slight increase with anorexia
Horses: Have increased bilirubin in health compared to other species (readily become icteric, especially with anorexia). Unconjugated bilirubin dominates, even in cholestatic conditions. Note they often have yellow serum in health (carotene)
Cattle: Icterus is commonly due to haemolysis. Rarely due to liver disease or cholestasis in this species
