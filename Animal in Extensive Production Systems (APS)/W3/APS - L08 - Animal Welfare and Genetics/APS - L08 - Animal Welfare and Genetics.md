# APS - L8 - Animal Welfare and Genetics

## Animal Welfare in Livestock Industries

What are the 5 welfare domains::nutrition, environment, health, behaviour, mental state

What are some of the major concepts related to animal welfare regulation
?
Large differences between countries on rules regarding how animals may be kept
Need to understand basic rules of any country to ensure you at a minimum work to that level
Rules around keeping animals in Australia for example can be regulated at Commonwealth, State, or Local level are mostly state based
Commonwealth: Live animal export
State: Codes of practice (Standards (required) and guidelines (recommended)) in Victoria, Livestock Management Act 2010
Local: range of rules on keeping animals/pets & road movement, e.g. pet sheep in general are not allowed on blocks of less than 0.5ha (50 x 100m) in Melbourne
Specific rules for different species for particular procedures
Different spacing allowances for different species
Significant change in the past 20 years that will continue due to ‚Äúsocial license‚Äù

Compare regulation and social change
?
Significant animal welfare improvement is often as much about companies moving towards societal expectations
Dr. Temple work in abattoirs in the USA to improve abattoirs 
Important and consistent price signal (or purchase signal) to abattoirs to meet key standards, not driven by government regulation but achieving significant welfare outcomes.

Does animal welfare change::absolutely, massive changes in minimum standards and average standards, better access to information technology that can improve animal welfare by better monitoring and recording, noting changes in condition score/body weight via eID for individual animals

## Animal Welfare Challenges in Extensive Livestock Systems
### Mulesing

What is mulesing::cutting away the skin from the side of the tail and the breech reason to get rid of folds in breech region

Why do producers mules their sheep::reduces the chance of flystrike, it was a permanent change and there were no other options, reduces amount of chemicals, reduces problems, primarily merino or merino derived breeds

What are some alternatives to musing::Going to a plain type sheep which has fewer wrinkles, local anesthetic applied and a NSAID to reduce pain, breeding sheep with fewer wrinkles

### Castration

What is castration::removing the testicles

Why is castration performed::reduce aggression, prevent damage to infrastructure

When is castration performed::as early as is reasonable

What methods are available for castration::knife, ring, berdizzo

What are some new tools for use during castration::NSAIDs to reduce pain, local anesthetic given to sheep (numb nuts) given by farmer, hormonal castration

### Shearing

What is shearing::removing fiber goats, sheep, and alpaca

Why is shearing done::collect fiber, get cast (too much wool, fat, and ruminants can get stuck on back)

How is shearing done::mechanically driven comb/cutter or hand shears, 2‚Äì3 minutes to shear

When is shearing done::once to twice a year

How can welfare related to shearing be improved::better education and training around shearing, robotization which is nice for heavy breeds

### Spaying

What is spaying::desexing adult female cattle, the ovary is cut from the fallopian tubes

Why is spaying done::to prevent animals from getting pregnant, which could cause them to get sick or be unable to be sold

What are some methods for improving welfare::better surgical procedures, NSAIDs

### Live Animal Export

Why are animals exported::demand overseas, cattle to Indonesia, sheep to the Middle East

How long does live animal export take::1-5 weeks on boat

What is the welfare issue and measure/report::large temperature changes and temperature on boats, survival reports, death rates, delivery rates, fairly severe impact on welfare

How can live animal export be improved::reducing trips during winter reduces the temperature changes, targeting shy feeders and make sure they eat, make sure that only healthy non-pregnant animals go onto the boats, large changes in the supervision of these animals by organizations

How can welfare based challenges be improved through the use of genetics and genomics testing::polled bull with horned cow results in no horns, Bos indicus this gene is not quite as simple, but genomics can help more

## Genetics

What is the scale of impact of breeding decision for a self replacing her/flock::compounding where progeny contribute to future genetics

Provide an overview of the term genetic variation and the types of traits we may select for
?
Genetic differences/variation between animals are due to differences in DNA sequence
In most populations we observe a distribution of traits e.g. growth rate controlled by multiple genes and can have a normal distribution as below
- Traits might be qualitative (One or small numbers of genes), poll vs horn, coat color (black vs red in Angus)
- Traits may be quantitative (e.g. growth rate), many genes

What does phenotype and genotype mean::phenotype: appearance or performance of an animal (colour, bodyweight, milk production) phenotype = genetics + environment, genotype: animals genetic makeup, all genes influencing a particular trait (expressed in environment as phenotype)

What do simple inherited trait and polygenic trait mean::simple inherited trait: impacted by single or few genes (horned/polled), polygenic trait: many genes involved (weaning weight, fertility, milk production)

What does breeding value mean::value of an animal as a parent due to genetics

What does heritability mean::measure of strength of relationship between breeding value and phenotypic value. High heritability means easier to make genetic progress.

What is a major gene::gene that has major impact on quantitative trait e.g. Boorola gene in sheep, double muscled gene in cattle (Belgian Blue)

Describe how the same animal raised in different environment will have a different phenotype
?
Huge range in potential genotype in offspring from two parents were many (possibly hundreds) of pairs of genes involved
Inbreeding (mating closely related animals such as father/daughter) decrease variation. Population genetically more uniform
Qualitative traits are not influenced by environment. Angus coat colour will always be red or block, not something in between
Quantitative traits are influenced by environment, often more impact from environment than genetics overall e.g. nutrition
These environmental differences are NOT transmitted to next generation.

How do we select for certain traits while looking at a bull in sale
?
Animal is a combination of phenotype and environment
Want good traits like milk production and less bad traits like dystocia
Moved to artificial selection to change (hopefully improve) gene frequency
Could do this by purchasing new sires, selecting home bred sires, artificially using artificial insemination (AI) or embryo transfer (ET)
We can select the new generation and cull (sell) older or "off-type" animals and keep the population size static
Need to weight up the balance of genetics in each animal (may keep some animals that have only average genetics in one area if have excellent genetics in other areas)

Do we select animals with a single or multiple traits in mind and why do we do that
?
Generally select traits of economic importance but maintaining animal health/reproductive traits
As number of traits selected for increases progress towards improving each traits will reduce. Selection for single traits leads to faster improvement, selection for many will reduce progress on each one (although some may be linked e.g. 200d and 400 growth in cattle)
Need to decide on what traits are most important and how many we want to include in an index (combination of traits to produce an index)
Can solely use index or may use combination of individual traits.

Why is it important to set bounds on the index
?
With respect to an index as a combination of traits
Within that index will be a range of separate traits, so the same index number may have a very different combination
We can maintain a minimum and maximum level in each area and then look at maximum index, this can be further enhanced if purchasing animals by putting a $ cost on each animal e.g. Manager is willing to pay a certain amount for each different animal based on genetic package

Describe what a selection index is
?
A range of different genetic evaluation programs available for different species e.g. Breedplan. Lambplan. Kidplan
These use phenotypic information from the individual animal as well as information from all their relatives
Importantly when data is collected this is done in groups that have been housed together to reduce/eliminate environmental variation
Different versions of these available around the world and these may be expressed differently as EBV or EPD 

What is an EBV
?
Estimated Breeding Values are calculated for a range of economically important quantitative traits (ASBV for sheep industry)
Often these are combined into a particular index to suit a particular market and different enterprises may use one or more indexes or focus on particular EBVs to progress towards a certain genetic goal
If a ram has a dollar index of 105 he will produce $5 extra per progeny, so if produces 200 progeny = $1000 extra than a dollar index ram of 100
Index on right shows same index but different composition of ASBVs

How do we chose our meeting groups for cattle
?
Could mate best to best and worst to worst or try to even out mating, best to worst and vice versa
Can be useful for "correct mating" for structural issues where want a mid range phenotype
Inbreeding: mating animals more closely related than average population (genetically related individuals). Can include for example mating sire with daughter or son with dam
- Increase homozygosity
- Can uncover undesirable recessive genes as increase in frequency
- Tends to reduce fertility and may reduce growth
- Some breeders use moderately closely related for ‚Äúlinebreeding‚Äù to increase genes from particular ancestor
- Progeny more likely to be like parent

What is outbreeding
?
Mating between individuals with unlike pedigree
Crossing inbred lines, different breeds
Mating a dairy animal to beef animal (Friesian cow to Angus bull to produce F1, often used as a vealer dam) Merino mated to Border Leicester = first cross ewe
Increases heterozygosity: more variability in progeny
Usually not common ancestors within 4 generations
Maintains high levels of performance and get few undesirable recessive genes (but monitor to ensure not present)

Why do we cross breed
?
Breed complementarity
Merino x Border Leicester
- Lots of Merino available so mate BL ram to Merino ewe. BL for meat characteristics and growth
Hybrid vigour
- Increase in performance in growth, fertility, survivability
- Amount by which progeny exceed the expected mid point of parents
Worthwhile noting don't just get the best traits of both breeds, can also get worst. Generally good traits tend to be dominant hence crossbreeding more commonly gets good traits

What are the two types of cross breeding systems
?
Simple system two breed cross then a terminal sire used with all progeny
More complex systems involving breed rotational crosses to get similar percentage of breed into the herd/flock. Tow or three breed rotational cross - can get complex with mating needs , but hybrid vigour can be maximised

What are genetic defections and give some examples::A range of genes can lead to genetic defects, dwarfism BLA (causes regular bacterial infection and early death), Curly Calf syndrome
Cull carriers from herd/flock, problem is happens in a sire that is used via AI as many impacted

What is the selection differential
?
The amount of selection pressure we apply
Generally apply greater selection on males than females only need 1:30 or 1:100 males:females
Maximum selection pressure in females more like 1:2 (keeping half of progeny, depending on species and breed)
Response to selection depends on heritability, proportion of population kept to breed and variation in population
Low heritability ranges from 0-20% while moderate ranges from 20-50%

What is genomics
?
Entire set of genes in an animal
can be used to predict genetic merit of animals early in life (based on historical phenotypic records collected and measured against genotype)
Reduces selection costs as can test using genomics once born and reduce requirements for progeny testing
need reference herd/flock to continue to benchmark genomics and performance
Using 50 000 SNP or lower test kits cost are now less than 100 per test

How can we speed up the gain rate::artificial insemination, multiple ovulation and embryo transfer, juvenile in vitro embryo transfer, sexing semen, cloning, transgenics
