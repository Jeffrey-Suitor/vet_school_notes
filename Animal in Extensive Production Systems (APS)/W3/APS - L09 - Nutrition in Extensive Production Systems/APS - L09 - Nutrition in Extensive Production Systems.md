# APS - L9 - Nutrition in Extensive Production Systems

## Extensive Animal Nutrition

What is a foregut fermenters
?
All camelids and ruminants are foregut fermenters
Each species has slight adaptation of the mouth/teeth/tongue important for selecting fodder and chewing cud (regurgitated forestomach contents)
Multiple stomachs to enable digestion of food that monogastrics are not capable of surviving on cellulose (four stomach in ruminant, three in camelids)
Within the forestomachs (prior to the acidic stomach) massive population of bacteria and protozoa - these digest the fodder into protein and energy usable by the animal

Describe the teeth in camelids and ruminants
?
The ability to chew is vital for a ruminant or camelid
- Physical breakdown of food particles to enable access for microbes
- Chewing produces saliva which helps buffer the forestomach pH
Most feed is re-chewed multiple times depending on its digestibility and how rapidly it can be made small enough to pass into the later stomachs/intestines
Camelids have the ability to spit in their cud if they take a dislike to someone or something

Provide a high level overview in ruminant and camelid forestomachs
?
Differences in physical structure between ruminant and camelid forestomachs
Play the same role - breaking down feed into energy and protein that is useable by the animal with assistance of microbes
Ruminants/camelids can survive on food not usable by humans (produce human food)
Forestomachs act as a feed reserve as they have a large capacity

What energy and nutrients is provided by the forestomachs:: Energy from (acetic acid, butyric acid, propionic acid) which is absorbed across the rumen. Microbial (most) and plant based protein

## Testing Feeds

What are some things we measure in feed::fatty acids, protein, carbohydrates (glucose, sugar)

Why test feedstuffs::There can be a very large range of value from various feedstuffs

T/F Hay in silage may have more variation than regular grains::True

What are the types of plants we feed animals
?
|             | Types                | Energy, Fibre, Protein             |
| ----------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Forage      | Fresh                | Varying content through year       |
|             | Ensiled(silage)      | Usually higher than hay, cut early |
|             | Dry (Hay)            | Moderate energy/protein            |
|             | Dry (Paddock)        | Modeerate, will degrade over time  |
|             | Dry (Straw, stubble) | Low energy/protein                 |
| Concentrate | Seeds                | Very high energy and good protein  |
|             | Fruits               | Varies                                   |

What is the composition of straw, grasses, grain, legumes
?
Straw: over half hemicellulose, cellulose
Grasses:: Still lots of hemicellulose and cellulose, but less than straw, more digestible elements, and more protein
Grain: A lot of starch in grain which can cause issues with grain overload (acidosis) in ruminants
Legumes: High in protein 

What are the best pasture times in SE Australia what does pasture look like throughout the year
?
| Month | State                          |
| ----- | ------------------------------ |
| Jan   | Quality low, quantity high     |
| March | Quality low, quantity low      |
| June  | Quality high, quantity low     |
| Sept  | Quality high and quantity high |

## Animal Requirements

How do we measure animal requirements
?
Energy is the most limiting element of extensive grazing nutrition tends to be energy followed by protein
Energy in ruminant diets is expressed as megajoules of metabolizable energy MJ or ME
Different sizes animals at various stage of their lives will have varying requirements 

What do we use to compare animal energy requirements
?
Dry Sheep Equivalent or DSE
In Victoria, a DSE is a 2-year-old 45 kg Merino sheep (wether or non-lactating, non-pregnant ewe) at maintenance = 7.7 MJ of ME

What are some systems other than DSE which you may see
?
Adult Equivalent (AE): 450 kg Bos taurus steer at maintenance, 2.25 years of age, walking 7 km per day = 72.6 MJ ME/day
Livestock units (LSU) based on 650 kg dairy cow producing 3000 kg milk annually = 124.9 MJ ME/day

What is the difference in DSE between Victoria and New South Wales::New south wales uses a 50 kg dry sheep not 45 = 9.44 MJ of ME

How  can we determine the average DSE of a property::calculate feed supply average and range over years and how varies from month to month

What calculations can we do once we know the DSE::stocking rate, management timing/decision and purchases /sales of livestock

T/F all properties are good for continuous stocking::False, properties may not be good for continuous stocking or only rotational grazing due to low rainfall/high temperature

What is the most limiting time during pasture growth::winter, most summers and early autumn have low growth

What is the best pasture growth rate
?
Attitude to risk
Attitude to longer term climate issues e.g. drying climate and lesser rainfall potentially shorter growing season but relatively gradual
SE Australia - research has produced such as the French equation (and others) to aid calculations of optimal stocking rate (SR) based on rainfall
