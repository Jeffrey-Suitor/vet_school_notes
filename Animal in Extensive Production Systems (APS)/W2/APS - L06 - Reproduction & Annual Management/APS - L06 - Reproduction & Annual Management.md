# APS - L6 - Reproduction & Annual Management
## Annual Management Planning

When does the autumn break occur in SE Australia::March, April onwards, can be as late as June or July

What does irrigation allows us to do::modify the pasture curve as we have constant access to water

Was is the difference between south eastern Australia and northern Australia::Southeast has a spring fall cycle while north has a wet/dry season cycle

When does the wet season occur::Matches up with summer

What elements do we have control over when it comes to pasture growth
?
Timing of reproduction
If you can separate males and females you can match nutritional needs to pasture supplies
Time and length of mating where we can optimize for male health (soundness test) and finding the minimum mating period for maximum pregnancy

What are some different scenarios for weaning
?
Immediately (dairy, helps control disease such as JD)
Balance between dam condition score(CS) and growth of young
Ensure young animal able to consume and maintain itself on diet it is weaned onto (young dairy calf taken from mother but continues on milk and concentrates for several weeks prior to weaning from milk)

What is the french model
?
It is an equation linking the stocking rate to rainfall and farm factors
Stocking rate (SR) = DSE / ha
SR = 1.3 * (R-250)/25

## Beef Cattle Example

Western Victoria - tradition calving in early Autumn, sell fast growing autumn born vealer at the end of spring
If we move to late Winter/early Spring calving it is a better match with feed supply, nutritional demand, reduces metabolic disease (grass tetany, milk fever), produces more beef per hectare
Wean calves early summer if need
Cheaper to supp feed calves than cows
Traditional system has high individual animal weights at sale but total per hectare meat production is limited
Cows often need lots of supplementary feed in autumn and winter, particular late autumn or even winter break
Spring calving system (August calving), mated in November when lots of high quality pasture
Wean calves as quantity/quality of grass reduces, grow weaners on supplementary feed plus pasture, maybe carry through second spring

## Management Practice Timing

What do we do to most offspring::castrate with band or knife

What do we do with offspring
?
Are they being sold, this determines what we will do
Castration
Vaccination
Other strategic health treatment - timing really depends on when born as well as external environment

What are some examples of strategic animal health measures
?
Vaccinations + drenches: Treatment in certain seasons may increase efficacy, integrating times when treatment is optimal for age, immunity
2 drench count in Australia, but try to reduce the amount of drenches
Lambs tail docked 2 weeks post lambing finish (lambs old enough to be yarded), also vaccinated, ear tagged, castrated

What is harvest::selling animals (slaughter, store stock for others to fatten, breeding stock), milk (1-3 x per day), fibre (1-3 x per year depending on breed and strain within breed)

Conservation of feed
?
More expensive than grazing pasture, conserving feed on property can help provide feed for longer
Silage: higher quality but higher cost (high % moisture)
Hay - poor quality but cheaper to produce (less moisture)
Sowing crop designed for this purpose (oats)
Specific feeds can fill nutritional "holes" or "low points" at critical times of year, often in winter. Grazing heat grows more dry matter in winter than other pastures

## Reproduction

What is the importance of reproduction::replace animals that die, replace animals that beyond effective breed age (cast for age CFA). allows for genetic selection in both male and female

What is the impact of reproduction on production::must give birth to produce milk (for a mammal), dairy cow

How often do cows produce milk::10 months

At what ages do we normally cull sheep and cattle::sheep 5-7 years, cattle 8-12 years

How does reproduction impact other management procedures::reduce handling in last third of gestation or post parturition, increased feed and attention required in pregnant or lactating animals

What are the impacts of reproduction on animal health
?
Diseases spread via sexual transmission
Increased risk of many diseases during pregnancy or lactation
Different ages of animals in self-replacing flock/herd/group

What are the key events in the reproduction cycle::joining -> gestation -> parturition -> lactation -> return to oestrous

T/F cows can be lactating and pregnant at same time::True

What are the important questions to ask for each stage of the reproduction cycle
?
Joining
- Age at first mating (joining) - how old/big does she need to be?
- Oestrus cycle length and pattern - when to mate
- Mating method - how to mate
- Joining (mating) period - how long to allow for her to become pregnant
Gestation
- Pregnancy testing - is she pregnant
- Gestation length - how long will she be pregnant
Parturition
- will it be be easy for her to give birth
- How many offspring will she have
Lactation
- How long should the offspring be left with the dam
Return to oestrus
- How long until she can be pregnant again

What are the key points around first mating
?
Larger the animal the longer the period before it will be mature enough to mate
A female needs to be mature enough to have started her reproductive cycle
An animal must be mature enough to cope with the weight of the male (depending on mating technique - not relevant for AI)
As a rule of thumb, female ruminants need to be in the order of 60-70% of adult body weight at first mating to get good pregnancy rates

What is the oestrous cycle
?
The recurring physiological changes induced by reproductive hormones (in many ways similar to the human menstrual cycle) once reach puberty
Females are usually only receptive to males during the oestrus stage of the cycle (also known as being "on heat") This is commonly a fairly short period of time (up to a few days) of each oestrus cycle
Most species will continue to have oestrus cycles through the year, others may only have 1-2 cycles per year (dogs)
Bovine estrus cycle is 21 days and sheep is 17 days

Describe what the term seasonal breeders has and the impact that it has on enterprises
?
The animals come into oestrus so that young will be born in spring due to better survival rates
They are seasonally polyoestrus which means they will cycle continuously during their reproductive season until they get pregnant

What tools can we use to help get season breeders to cycle outside of their typically season::lights or melatonin shots

Describe the oestrus cycle and heat times for cows, sheep (long wool British breeds), sheep other than long wool British breeds, Alpacas and Deer
?
| Species                          | Oestrus Cycle Length | Time On Heat (In Oestrus)   | Seasonal Breeders? |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Cows (dairy and beef)            | 21 days              | 2-28 hours                  | No                 |
| Sheep - long wool British breeds | 17 days              | 24-28 hours                 | Short day          |
| Sheep - other                    | 17 days              | 24-28 hours                 | A little bit       |
| Alpacas                          | No regular cycle     | Depends on ovarian activity | No                 |
| Deer                             | 17 - 22 days         | 24 hours                    | Short day                   |

## Female Reproductive Terms

What is the joining period::joining or mating period is the time at which the sexes are mixed or artificial insemination will be conducted. It determines the time over which offspring will be born. It is often based on number of oestrous cycles and the males will be with the females. It can be expressed as the number of cycles or the numbers of weeks

How many cycles do we normally do for a joining period::2-3 cycles

Describe the process of heat detection
?
With natural mating the males are able to identify on-heat females (those at the oestrogen peak of their cycle) through pheromones and behaviour
In industries where supervised mating or AI is common (dairy cattle) we need to be able to identify when females are on heat so that they are mated at the time that gives the greatest chance of getting pregnant.
- Can be done by observing physical signs such as a swollen vulva, behavioural changes such as winking in horses or behaviour in the presence of a male (often called a teaser) showing interest or not rejecting in the male
- Heat detection aids can also be used (Kamars on dairy cattle)
- In some industries ultrasound of follicles is also used to provide a high level of detail about the timing of mating

What are some of the methods we use for heat detection on dairy cattle, beef cattle, small ruminants, Alpaca, and Deer
?
| Species         | Method of heat detection                                                                                    |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Beef cattle     | Bull in paddock, cows riding cow on heat                                                                    |
| Dairy cattle    | Visual observation of mounting or detection aids (Kamars) during AI period; bull in paddock after AI period |
| Small ruminants | Ram/buck in paddock, mating crayon                                                                          |
| Alpaca          | Bring male and female together and assess female acceptance of male                                         |
| Deer            | Stag/buck in paddock                                                                                        |


What are the three common methods of mating
?
1. Paddock mating - e.g. beef cattle, sheep, deer, goats
2. Supervised natural mating - e.g. Alpaca
3. AI - e.g. dairy cattle, stud animals

What is pregnancy testing, it's main advantages and two common techniques
?
Not done on all industries or properties
Advantages:
- Identify which females are pregnant so they can either be rejoined or sold
- Estimate time of parturition
- Check for multiple fetuses to allow for appropriate management e.g. in horses twin are not viable so one fetus is often crushed, in sheep ewes with twins or triplets may be separated so that they receive adequate nutrition
Most commonly done using ultrasound or rectal palpation

What is the gestation period of the following types of animals::bovine, ovine, caprine, cervine, alpaca
?
| Species       | Gestation period (days) |
| ------------- | ----------------------- |
| Bovine        | 283                     |
| Ovine         | 147 (145-150)           |
| Caprine       | 150                     |
| Cervine (Red) | 234                     |
| Alpaca        | 345                        |

What is the gestation period and why is it important
?
Time from mating to parturition (birth) for mammal
Varies for each species (and within species)
Important determinant in generation interval
Important because
- Number of age groups on property/area
- Ability to match natural feed supply

What does the term prolificacy mean::Number of progeny per pregnancy (laying season) which varies between species

Describe some of the factors that affect the ease of parturition between species
?
Relative size of offspring to dam (average piglet is 0.5% of dam body weight where as beef calf is 10% of dam's body weight)
Anatomical factors: brachycephalic dogs have large heads and narrow pelvis which results in many caessarians
Litter size - larger litters will usually have smaller offspring
Normal duration of parturition varies significantly between species

What is lactation and the lactation period
?
The lactation period (also known as the pre-weaning period) is the time the offspring are suckling milk from the dam
Lactation length varies significantly between species based on the needs of the offspring, the needs of the dam, and production requirements
Where milk is a key product, the offspring are usually weaned within the first days of life and fed milk replacer (dairy calves)

Describe what weaning is
?
All domestic animals must be weaned from their mother's milk. The age at which weaning occurs depends on:
- Feed availability for mother - if poor ma limit milk supply
- Need for mother to have a break before the next pregnancy or birth
- Age at which offspring are able to digest solid feed
- Need for milk as product (dairy cow)
Weaning time on the same property can vary from year to year based on feed availability.
In most cases offspring gradually begin to eat solid feed while still drinking from their mother

What does return to oestrous mean
?
After giving birth, most species will have a period of not cycling while in peak lactation. The dam cannot become pregnant again until she returns to oestrus
in species with longer lactation periods the dam will usually return to oestrus while still lactating
There is also some variation within species. Females in ideal body condition score will start cycling more quickly that those in a lower body condition score, similar those with access to optimal feed will cycle more rapidly than those on lower quantity/quality

## Male Reproduction

What are the main events in male reproduction
?
Age at first mating (joining) - how/big does he need to be?
Fitness for mating - what needs to be checked?
Other aspects covered under female section

Describe the importance of age structure in animals
?
In some enterprises all animals are the same age - all in, all out production systems such as Merino wethers, finish beef steers etc
In any self replacement enterprise there are multiple age groups - consisting of males and females
Reproductive age of females and males varies with each species
In any one year it is impossible to replace the entire breed female population unless the progeny per female is a minimum of 2 presuming sex ratio is 1:1

Describe ruminant reproduction generally
?
Ruminants share similarities in their reproduction, though there are also considerable differences between them
Goats and long wool British breed sheep are highly seasonal breeders, giving birth in spring (cycle in Autumn)
Cattle, merino & most short wool British breed sheep are less seasonal or not seasonal
Oestrous (cyclicity) reduced post partum (after birth)
Oestrous reduce if in low condition score and low feed consumption. If cow gives birth in CS2 and low feed may take 60-70 days to cycle (compared o 30 days for CS4 and good feed)
Presence of male may increase number of females coming into oestrous, rams and ewes

Describe the joining period in males and answer the key question of age at first mating
?
As with females, the larger the species the longer it generally takes to become sexually mature
Obviously must have reached puberty and be producing sperm
For species where mating takes place in the paddock, or which use supervised natural mating, need to be able to successfully mount females

When should we assess males for reproductive fitness and what should we assess them for
?
Always examine several weeks before joining date
Assess for
- Condition score
- Teeth
- Musculoskeletal soundness
- Scrotal size, palpation of testes for symmetry and firmness
- Penis and prepuce for swelling and wounds, ability to protrude
- Semen exam if necessary

## Reproductive issues

What are the 5 stages of reproductive loss::conception (embryo, foetus), parturition, pre-weaning, post-weaning, adult

How is the rate of reproduction measured
?
Ovulation rate
Fertilisation rate: Relatively high loss rate possible (good number of ova produced but poor embryo survival/production)
Birth survival, neonatal & weaning
- Survival to weaning (23%, 32% singles, 45% multiple)
- 6 dead within 24 hours of birth, further 14% by day 7, further 3% between 7-30 & 8% between 30 and 110 day
Once born it is relatively easy to measure survival rate at different time points (but MUST be physically measured as opposed to guesstimated)
Rates of survival are higher now

What is the range of lamb deaths::6-19% for singles, 19 - 63% for twins

What are some strategies for improving lamb survival
?
Survival of weaner sheep: body weight at weaning, growth weight
Body weight of dam at lambing
Nutrition post parturition
Nutrition post weaning

How do we estimate reproductive loss
?
It can be difficult to estimate reproductive "wastage" or loss in some industries due to lack of data
Good point to start = number of females bred, multiplied by industry standard for progeny per female
What is the difference between this number and the actual number of animals that are produced each year - reasonable guesstimate of post birth deaths (doesn't account for loss during conception/gestation)
There will always be loss - it is unavoidable
What loss is acceptable (a lower weaning rate in some situations may be more profitable)

What are the causes of loss in pregnancy::genetics (size, shape, etc.), nutrition, infectious disease, predation, environment

What is the role of genetics in calculating reproductive loses::birth weight, lambing ease direct, lambing ease daughters, similar figures available on other databases, physical shape ease of parturition

What are some genetic defect that can reduce reproductive rate
?
Curly calf syndrome (arthrogrypoesis multiplex)
Breeds with large heads or high muscling (dystocia - caesarean section)
Identification of breeders with conditions
Toxins

What causes pregnancy loss in terms of nutrition
?
Majority of fetal growth occurs during last third of gestation
Multiple progeny need plenty of feed to get adequate weight, not too much for singles
Lactation - high energy and protein demand (more demand if more progeny)
Any interference in lactation -> progeny death (can transfer some progeny to other dams)
Once weaned- weaner must adapt to adult diet in most situations - easily controlled in intensive production systems (pig, chicken, feedlot etc.) not as easy in extensive production systems
Diet should be balanced (consider giant dog breed diet)
Important that not too much nutrition is spent feeding internal parasites
Adequate trace element nutrition

How can infectious disease cause loss of progeny
?
Male +  female in adequate condition = progeny
The equation above holds true as long as the male and female are reproductively "fit"
Infectious disease can significantly reduce ability to successfully rear progeny  -either in dam or sire
May be transferred from male to female
- EHV 3 - vesicles pustules and external genitalia: EHV 1 - abortion
- Ovine burcellosis - male infertility
Poor body condition score of male or female can also drastically reduce reproduction rate

How can predation impact loss on an enterprise
?
Primarily wild dogs, foxes, pigs, and less commonly birds of prey
Control methods:
- guard animals (dogs or camelids mostly)
- Shooting/baiting (coordinated)
- safe containment areas
- Dog proof fences

How can the environment cause loss on enterprise
?
Extreme environmental conditions are one of the largest killers of newborn extensive livestock
Heat, cold, rain, wind
The worse of these is cold for terrestrial animals

How can we improve birthing success
?
Remove those causes reducing optimisation of success
It may not be financially viable to maximise reproductive success as this would mean all animals were maximum condition score
There will however be an optimal condition score for any given year, given nutritional seasonal constraints
Matching breeding with season there is a limiting factor, match lactation to maximum grass for milk supply
Be able to investigate and find causes of loss, suggest direction to reduce this loss
