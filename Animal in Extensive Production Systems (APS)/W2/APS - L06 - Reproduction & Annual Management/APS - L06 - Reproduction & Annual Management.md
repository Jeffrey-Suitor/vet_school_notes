# APS - L6 - Reproduction & Annual Management
## Annual Management Planning

When does the autumn break occur in SE Australia::March, April onwards, can be as late as June or July

What does irrigation allows us to do::modify the pasture curve as we have constant access to water

Was is the difference between south eastern Australia and northern Australia::Southeast has a spring fall cycle while north has a wet/dry season cycle

When does the wet season occur::Matches up with summer

What elements do we have control over when it comes to pasture growth
?
Timing of reproduction
If you can separate males and females you can match nutritional needs to pasture supplies
Time and length of mating where we can optimize for male health (soundness test) and finding the minimum mating period for maximum pregnancy

What are some different scenarios for weaning
?
Immediately (dairy, helps control disease such as JD)
Balance between dam condition score(CS) and growth of young
Ensure young animal able to consume and maintain itself on diet it is weaned onto (young dairy calf taken from mother but continues on milk and concentrates for several weeks prior to weaning from milk)

What is the french model
?
It is an equation linking the stocking rate to rainfall and farm factors
Stocking rate (SR) = DSE / ha
SR = 1.3 * (R-250)/25

## Beef Cattle Example

Western Victoria - tradition calving in early Autumn, sell fast growing autumn born vealer at the end of spring
If we move to late Winter/early Spring calving it is a better match with feed supply, nutritional demand, reduces metabolic disease (grass tetany, milk fever), produces more beef per hectare
Wean calves early summer if need
Cheaper to supp feed calves than cows
Traditional system has high individual animal weights at sale but total per hectare meat production is limited
Cows often need lots of supplementary feed in autumn and winter, particular late autumn or even winter break
Spring calving system (August calving), mated in November when lots of high quality pasture
Wean calves as quantity/quality of grass reduces, grow weaners on supplementary feed plus pasture, maybe carry through second spring

## Management Practice Timing

What do we do to most offspring::castrate with band or knife

What do we do with offspring
?
Are they being sold, this determines what we will do
Castration
Vaccination
Other strategic health treatment - timing really depends on when born as well as external environment

What are some examples of strategic animal health measures
?
Vaccinations + drenches: Treatment in certain seasons may increase efficacy, integrating times when treatment is optimal for age, immunity
2 drench count in Australia, but try to reduce the amount of drenches
Lambs tail docked 2 weeks post lambing finish (lambs old enough to be yarded), also vaccinated, ear tagged, castrated

What is harvest::selling animals (slaughter, store stock for others to fatten, breeding stock), milk (1-3 x per day), fibre (1-3 x per year depending on breed and strain within breed)

Conservation of feed
?
More expensive than grazing pasture, conserving feed on property can help provide feed for longer
Silage: higher quality but higher cost (high % moisture)
Hay - poor quality but cheaper to produce (less moisture)
Sowing crop designed for this purpose (oats)
Specific feeds can fill nutritional "holes" or "low points" at critical times of year, often in winter. Grazing heat grows more dry matter in winter than other pastures
