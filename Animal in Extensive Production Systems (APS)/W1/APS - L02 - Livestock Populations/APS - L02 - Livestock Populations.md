# APS - L2 - Livestock Populations

## 1.2 - Worldwide Livestock Populations

Animals of focus:

- Cattle (beef + dairy)
- Sheep (wool, meat, milk)
- Goats (fibre, meat, milk)
- Camelids (meat, sometimes milk)
- Alpaca (fibre, meat)

Overall size of international animal population determines total available output from them 
Each country has different outputs even for same animal but found in different country
Challenging to get current, accurate information on domesticated livestock around the world

### Sheep

There is about 1 billion sheep in the world. Challenging to get accurate numbers due to the birth rate of sheep (multiple lambs, multiple litters per year) and also sales. The density of sheep can also vary greatly, region to region and country to country.

### Goats

There are 750 000 goats in the world and they are often grown alongside sheep.

### Cattle

There are about a billion cattle in the world

### Buffalo

There are about 200 000 buffalo mostly concentrated in India and China


### Deer, Alpaca, and Camel Herds

There are a large number of wild deer which can be harvested. New Zealand has the largest deer farm with 4 million deer, 3.5 - 4 million found in South America (Peru), and global camel population is estimated to be about 30 million with large amounts of wild camels.

## 1.3 Worldwide Import and Export of Animal Products

### Meat Production numbers

Beef:
- 10.9 million in carcass weight
- 71.1 million tonnes total
- Argentina, Australia, Brazil, USA were biggest exporter 
- China and USA biggest importer

Lamb: 
- Output 15 million tonnes
- Export 1.5 million tonnes
- Australia is 70 - 75% of total export

Goat:
- 5.3 million tonnes production
- 50 000 tonnes in carcass weight
- Australia exports half of goat meat but consumes little domestically

Goat + Camelid:
- Very small market
- New Zealand exported 12 000 tonnes in 2018
- NZ exported 4 500 tonnes of co-products
- 900 000 animals farmed deer in NZ
- Alpaca 12 000 tonnes globally

### Fibre Production Numbers

Sheep: 
- 1.2 billion kilograms of fleece wool
- 477 431 400 kilos exported
- Biggest export was China to Australia
- Only 2% used in global apparel rest goes into things like carpet
- Location of wool on sheep changes it's properties

Goat:
- Two fibres are cashmere and mohair
- Mohair is 0.15% of fibre production, 15 000 tonnes
- Cashmere about 5 000 tonnes

Alpaca:
- Mostly in Peru
- 3 500 tonnes in Peru and 1 500 tonnes elsewhere in the world

### Milk Production

Many different types that are consumed in different regions
150 million households are involved in milk production
Cattle are 80%, buffalo 15%, goat 2%, sheep 1% of global milk production
78 000 000 tonnes exported of milk
860 000 000 tonnes produced
Rarely liquid milk traded, but it's traded as other milk products

### World Wide Animal Export

Some countries would rather trade in life animals for a variety of reasons
Export is challenging due to distance and change in climate that animals undergo
Live much smaller than fresh/frozen meat
Voyages can often result in death which is why new requirements involving timing of voyages, density, and ESCAS (guaranteed ownership claims)

Most live cattle exports from Australia go to Indonesia or Asian ports

Most live sheep exports go to the Middle East

Pork and chicken is often cheaper and so has become the choice for many Australians and most businesses export overseas due to a larger demand with better returns.

## 1.4 Extensive Livestock Production

Define extensive livestock production::Animals that are often grazing in paddocks and aren't brought their own feed but during certain times of the year may be provided feed if necessary

We can calculate the amount of feed available by using metrics such as temperature and rainfall to predict the rate at which the feed will grow and how large of a herd can be sustained

Australia experiences relatively low rainfall the cost and north part of Australia sees rainfall. North has a wet and dry season while the south has a spring and fall season.

Irrigation is another method to supplement rainfall however, due to climate change it is possible that irrigation systems may need to change

Temperature is another important factor, where plants want mostly temperate conditions above 10C with below 10C slowing growth and below 6C effectively stopping it.
