## 1.5 International Trade

Important for producers that produce excess such as Australia and New Zealand. There are also issues with shelf life related to some products such as milk where as some products such as fibre last longer.

It is important to consider the exchange rate when looking at products as certain products may be cheaper or more costly depending on what country you purchase the product from.

Australian products often have clean and green images associated with them and due to being an island has a higher level of biosecurity.

Anthrax is endemic to Australia and while not usually and issue it is important to control and reduce trade from those regions during an outbreak.

Australia also has consistent identification for cattle and putting it in place for sheep. This electronic system allows for rapid identification of stock that have come in contact with disease so as to be able to act and move rapidly to stop more production and prevent the spread. This also provides strict information regarding withholding period, export slaughter interval, and assists with retention of reputation.

Farmers can often be impacted by international politics which due to war or economic decisions can see entire markets removed overnight. This can have positive and negative outputs.

The benefits of production systems is hard to assess. For example, there may be a financial benefit but there are also benefits to rural space both psychologically, medically, or culturally.

## 1.6 General Industry Structure

Larger industries tend to have a better organized structure. 

There is little financial subsidy for farming Australia so research and development has proved essential to ensure that farmers remain competitive on international markets.

Farm managers tend to have little control over inputs and outputs. Therefore, they must maximize their efficiency to increase returns. Significant improvements in productivity but often it doesn't make it more profitable. We are currently producing 3X the amount off the same area.

Research in Australia is funded by producers and government. Research and Development Corporations (RDCs)  do the research. This can reduce cost of food and assist producers. RDC's budgets can be in hundreds of millions. Much of this research is published compared to commercial research which is often not.

Breed society's are focused on the appearance and maintenance of the breed. They review risks for the breed, publish breed standards, pedigree registration, and act as a semi regulatory body.

Cooperative Research Centres (CRC's) are Australian specific research groups that receive grant funding for industry lead collaborative research for up to 10 years and short term grants for 3 years. The goal of these is to solve industry identified problems in the Australian industry.

There is also academic's who do University research and can partner with CRC's and RDC's for their research or focus in other areas.

Veterinary chemicals in Australia are tightly regulated, AVPMA regulates most of this. Drug scheduling determines who can prescribe and administer certain drugs. For drugs to get registered it is very expensive and takes a lot of time so there are some drugs that are not registered for use in certain species but we are still confident in their efficacy.

Export Slaughter Interval (ESI) is the minimum time that should elapse between giving a veterinary drug and slaughtering that animal for export.

Withholding period (WHP) is the same concept as ESI but is for domestic use.

Livestock Production Assurance (LPA) is Australian's assurance program to make meat is produced safely and ethically

National Vendor Declaration (NVD) is a form that must be filled out before livestock can leave the farm. This involves livestock history and on farm practices.

## 1.7 Inputs in Extensive Production Systems

There are a variety of inputs:
- dollars per hour
- sustainability Index
- KPIs
- margin or other metrics

The key inputs for livestock are:
- land
- animals
- labour
- pasture and infrastructure

### Land

Primary building block of extensive enterprise

Combined with environmental elements determines what pasture base is possible

Can be owned, leased, or agisted

Can assess total stocking rate based on size due to the stocking per area being relatively constant.

### Animals

Some enterprises can have one species or multiple species which has various advantages and disadvantages such as spread risk but may not be as specialized.

Total numbers on property = animals per hectar * hectares grazed

Some enterprises may solely fatten animals while others have a self replacing breeding flock/herd. This can change age groups and risk of disease.

It is important to know the history of the animals to better understand the farm status.

### Labour

Right people with right knowledge and right application

Written as full time equivalent due to many different contractors to meet the range of disciplines.

Significant training needed, rules / regulations about who can do what roles.

Contract jobs including shearing, marking, crutching, pregnancy testing, artificial insemination, and a range of other.

Australian farmers tend to be older than the regular workforce.

### Pasture Management

Need enough pasture to sustain the animals

High rainfall zones have higher cost per hectar but run a higher stocking rate

Soil type is important and determines the amount and type of fertilizer needed. This is done via soil testing.

Higher pasture production more likely to have regular stock movements

Temperature regions mostly C3 plants, tropical more C4 plants.

Often livestock are integrated with pasture / grain systems so that paddocks rotate every year

Herbicides are used for weed control

Roundup been highly beneficial in soil conservation  / minimum till cropping / planting

### Farm Fencing

Most farms require fencing unless stock are hefted (go to the same place every year).

Fences come in a variety of forms including electric and conventional. Different fence types are needed for different breeds. Merino sheep respect fence where as British sheep less so. Different fence types also require different types of upkeep.

### Farm Infrastructure

Dairy Farm:
- Dairy
- Silo
- Yards
- Landways
- Small paddock fencing (often electric)
- Regulations around design

Merino:
- Shearing shed
- Sheep years
- Silo
- Hay shed

Also need other things such as silage (high water content hay) and tool / equipment storage. Laneways for stock movement, water and power, along with how we supply that water.

There are several options for transport:
- Motorbikes
- Utility (Ute)
- Tractor with a roll over protection system (ROPS)
- Horses
- Helicopters especially in Northern Australia

### Feeding Infrastructure

Usually done for part of a year. Livestock are contained to a feedlot. There may be a drought plan to protect the pasture (sell stock or feed stock)

Tractor + grain / roughage feeder required for feeding.

Auger to move grain in and out of the silo.

Water infrastructure + shade

Hay shed + silos


### Machinery

There are several common types of machinery:

- Tractor + frontend loader (usually)
- Utility vehicle
- Helicopter in Northern Australia
- Hay/silage equipment
- Planting equipment
- Grain harvester
- Spray equipment
- Truck or trailer for livestock movement
- Contractors used for jobs needing specialized equipment such as livestock transport and sowing pasture

### Veterinarians

- Usually considered a significant cost but often lower per animal cost.
- Costs include:
    - Vaccinations
    - Parasite control
    - Preventatives / treatment
    - Help with pregnancy testing or other issues
