# APS - L1 - Australian livestock in the world
## 1.1.- Country and world Populations

Australia has a small population 0.3% with a large livestock production

As countries become more wealthy, there is a change in consumption patterns. For example Chinese milk consumption which has increased due to increase in wealth

Due to increasing agriculture needs we have dedicated some land to more agriculture but no where near the past 50 years and we are running out of available land. Therefore, we are having to clear more natural land which isn't ideal. 

We also want to reduce food waste and have been looking into ways of producing more effectively.
