Below is a document illustrating class data obtained  previously from experiments conducted  using this  same protocol.  Compare the shape of your graphs (hopefully the shape of the graphs should be somewhat similar!) with this class data and then answer the following questions.

Question 2

1 / 1 pts

The flat section on the left hand part of the sigmoid-shaped  concentration response curve for NA reflects the fact that the amount of binding of NA to receptor is insufficient to elicit a response in the tissue.

Correct!

  True 

YES!  Correct- and conversely at the top of the curve where the response plateau's all receptors are bound with NA and no further increase in response can be elicited.

  False 

Question 3

1 / 1 pts

In the presence of propranol, the concentration/response curve to NA in the atrium shows a parallel rightward shift.  This observation is consistent with which of the following.

  noncompetitive antagonism 

Correct!

  competitive antagonism 

Yes!  in competitive antagonism, if enough agonist (NA) is added, the blocking agent wil be displaced from the receptors and a maximal response can be restored.

What does this curve tell you about the type of receptors eliciting teh NA induced increase in Heart rate?

  functional antagonism 

  synergism 

Question 4

1 / 1 pts

The NA concentration response curves generated in the presence of propranolol and then phentolamine suggest that the vasoconstricting effects of NA in aortic preparations are mediated through alpha receptor activation.

Correct!

  True 

  False 

Question 5

1 / 1 pts

The NA concentration response curves generated in the presence of   phentolamine and then propranolol suggest that the chronotropic  effects of NA on the sino-atrial node are mediated through alpha receptor activation.

  True 

Correct!

  False 

Thats correct!  In the atria- the addition of **phentolamine** makes little difference to the response curve.   In other words, binding of a blocking agent to the NA receptor does not block the NA. response- this is evidence that NA must be eliciting its effects through binding to the Beta receptor.  By contrast  the beta blocker propranolol shifts the response curve to the right.
