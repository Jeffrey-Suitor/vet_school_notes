# Q1
Which of the following result in a disorder of secondary haemostasis?

Immune-mediated thrombocytopaenia
**Haemophilia**
von Willebrand's disease
**Rodenticide poisoning**
**Vitamin K deficiency**

# Q2
Which of the following clinical signs are likely findings in disorders of secondary haemostasis?

Bleeding immediately after venepuncture
**Delayed bleeding after venepuncture**
**Haematomas common**
**Large volume bleeds**
Small volume bleeds
Petechiae and ecchymoses common
**Petechiae and ecchymoses rare**
May bleed from multiple sites but often localised to one site
Haematomas uncommon
Usually bleeding from multiple sites

# Q3
Disorders of secondary haemostasis involve prolonged large volume bleeds, because when the coagulation cascade is impaired, fibrin cannot be generated.

TRUE

# Q4
Factor VII contributes to the extrinsic coagulation pathway

TRUE

# Q5
Warfarin is an irreversible inhibitor of vitamin K reductase

FALSE

# Q6
The difference between first and second generation rodenticides is that first generation rodenticides are reversible and second generation rodenticides are not

FALSE

# Q7
Arterial thrombi generally develop at sites of blood stasis

FALSE

# Q8
Vitamin K deficiency or antagonism will result in impairment of the intrinsic and common coagulation pathways but not the extrinsic pathway

FALSE

# Q9
Which of the following coagulation factors has the shortest half life?

7

# Q10
Place the following events in order for the formation of a thrombus

1.  platelets adhere to exposed subendothelial collagen (using collagen receptors+/- von Willebrand factor)

2. platelets become activated, releasing molecules (e.g. ADP and thromboxane A2)

3. platelets aggregate via binding of soluble fibrinogen

4. local activation of the coagulation cascade

5. bound soluble fibrinogen molecules converted into an insoluble, cross-linked fibrin polymer

# Q11
List three factors that predispose to thrombus formation

• Blood stasis or turbulence
• Endothelial damage
• Hypercoagulability of blood

# Q12
The anti-coagulant activity of warfarin is due to
decreased synthesis of thromboxane
**decreased formation of clotting factors**
glycoprotein receptor antagonism
inhibition of platelet activation
increased activity of antithrombin

# Q13
Why are the anticoagulant effects of heparin seen both in vivo and in vitro, whilst warfarin’s anticoagulant activity is seen only in vivo?

Warfarin does not affect active clotting factors, but instead inhibits the reduction of vitamin K for vitamin K-dependent clotting factors

# Q14
The anticoagulant activity of aspirin is

due to competitive inhibition of cyclooxygenase
directly proportional to the dose administered
dependent on platelet glycoprotein receptors
impaired in Vitamin K deficiency states
**the result of reduced thromboxane synthesis**

# Q15
A venous thromboembolus arising in a segment of gut is most likely to lodge in the

**Liver**
Lungs
Heart
Kidneys
Brain

# Q16
Match each term with it's definition

Ischaemia: hypoxic or anoxic tissue injury resulting from a local reduction in blood flow.

Infarction: the process by which ischaemic necrosis of a localized area of tissue develops.

Infarct: the area of tissue which has undergone infarction.

Embolism: the blockage of a downstream vessel by an embolus arising upstream.

# Q17
List four factors that contribute to the outcome of infarction in an organ

Vascular supply- presence of alternative supply
Time course of occlusion
Size of vessel occluded
Vulnerability of the affected organ’s cells to hypoxia

# Q18
Which of the following statements about venous thrombi is **incorrect**?

There is usually rapid propagation of venous thrombi
Venous thrombi are usually occlusive
Venous thrombi are typically pale with prominent laminations
**The surface of venous thrombi tends smooth surfaced and moist**

# Q19
A 6 month old male entire puppy is rushed to your clinic collapsed. The owner reports that she caught him playing with a wasps nest and you immediately recognise diffuse urticaria. You suspect a severe anaphylactic reaction. Which classification of shock does this belong to?

Obstructive shock
Metabolic shock
**Distributive shock**
Hypovolemic shock

# Q20

Which of the following statements about indirect measurement of systemic blood pressure is correct?

**Lowering the limb below the level of the heart will increase recorded pressures in the limb**
Intensity of Korotkov sounds corresponds with pulse amplitude in the artery
Korotkov sounds are heard when the cuff pressure exceeds systolic pressure
Parks Doppler method of blood pressure measurement detects diastolic pressure

# Q21
The following measures of blood pressure are recorded in a cat:

Systolic pressure 150mmHg •Diastolic pressure 90mmHg   Based on these readings, this cat is likely to be:

Normotensive
Hypotensive
**Hypertensive**

# Q22
Match the terms

Cardiogenic shock: Failure of the heart to provide forward flow.

Hypoxemic shock: A decrease in oxygen content in arterial blood.

Metabolic shock: Derangement of cellular metabolic machinery.

Obstructive shock: Inability of cardiac filling.

Hypovolaemic shock: Decrease in circulating blood volume.

Distributive shock: A marked decrease in systemic vascular resistance (vasodilation).
