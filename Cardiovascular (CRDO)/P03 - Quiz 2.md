Question 1

1 / 1 pts

Which of the following elements is required to maintain the viability of tissue in an organ bath preparation?

  Hydration with a buffered salt solution (Krebs) 

  Appropriate temperature, maintained by a warm water jacket 

  oxygenation 

Correct!

  all of the above 

Question 2

1 / 1 pts

When recording heart rate in the organ bath preparation, heart rate is computed in the Powerlab using moment by moment changes in tension in the atrial tissue that are measured with an isometric force displacement transducer 

Correct!

  True 

Yes- thats correct!  The Powerlab interpolates HR from the interval between contractile events. 

  False 

Question 3

1 / 1 pts

Which of the following would be a valid reason to dilute the dose of a drug prior to administration?

Correct!

  the patient is very small and the appropriate dose of the "stock" solution could not be accurately titrated 

Yes!  IN veterinary medicine we care for patients of very varied sizes- from grams to tonnes in weight!

Managing dilutions is a part of every day clinical life for veterinarians

  the patient is very large and so large volumes of teh stock solution wold be required 

  you are unsure of the likely effect of the drug on the patient 

  you suspect that the drug is toxic 

Question 4

1 / 1 pts

You have been provided with 0.1ml of an anaesthetic drug and have been asked to prepare  a 1 in 10 dilution of it for administration to a pet mouse. 

How much saline would you add to the 0.1ml of drug, in order to achieve a 1 in 10 dilution?

Correct!

0.1ml in .09ml, equates to one ml  in ten mls

Question 7

1 / 1 pts

When constructing dose response curves, cumulative additions of drug are made to the organ bath, starting with the **lowest** concentration of drug. 

In this experiment the drug concentration of Noradrenaline in the  "stock" solution is 1 X 10-5  M.   What volume of this stock solution will need to be added to an organ bath with a volume of 25mLs to achieve a bath concentration of 1 X 10-8  M?

  100 microlitres 

  500 microlitres 

Correct!

  25 microlitres 

Correct-  1 X 10-8  M is one thousand fold MORE dilute than 1 X 10-5  M. If we add 25 uL to a 25 mL organ bath  this represents a one in one thousand dilution

  2.5 microlitres 

  250 microlitres 

Question 8

0 / 1 pts

Which of the following receptor types are expressed on the Sino-atrial node?

  muscarinic, nicotinic and beta adrenergic 

  muscarinic, nicotinic and alpha adrenergic 

Correct Answer

  muscarinic, and beta adrenergic 

You Answered

  muscarinic, and alpha adrenergic 

Question 9

1 / 1 pts

Phentolamine is an antagonist at which of the following receptors?

  beta adrenergic receptors 

  muscarinic receptors 

Correct!

  alpha adrenergic receptors 

  alpha and beta adrenergic receptors 

  No answer text provided. 

  histamine receptors 

Question 10

1 / 1 pts

Noradrenaline is selective for beta receptors in the cardiovascular system. 

  True 

Correct!

  False 

No- noradrenaline is NON selective- in other words it wil bind to both alpha and beta receptors in the Cardiovascular system and elicit an effect.
