## CRDO - L01

What are the roles of the cardiovascular system?
?
Exchange of molecules,  delivery of substrates, removal of waste
Distribution of messengers such as hormones and defence mechanisms
Temperature regulation

What are the 4 core components of the cardiovascular system
?
Heart -> driving force
Arterial system -> distribution channels
Microcirculation -> exchange vessels
Venous system -> blood resevoirs, return blood to the heart

Outline the composition of intracellular and extracellular body water composition::1/3 extracellular (1/4 plasma, 3/4 interstitial), 2/3 intracellular

What are the roles of the capillaries?
?
Exchange
A single layer of endothelial cells
Located close to every cell in the body (30-100 um distance)
reduced diffusion distance increases the rate of diffusion per Fick's law

Outline movement across capillary walls
?
Diffusion 
- Lipid across EC
- Lipid insoluble through ECs and through pores
- Rate of diffusion described by Fick's law
Transcytosis or pinocytosis
- Movement of macromolecules across ECs in vesicles
Bulk flow via Starling's Forces - driving force
- Bulk flow of fluid through channels in capillary wall - molecules moving together in bulk

Outline filtration at the arterial end of the capillary
?
Hydrostatic forces favouring filtration are greatest at the **arterial ends of the capillaries**
**Oncotic osmotic pressure predominates that the venous ends** of the capillaries
Excess fluid collects in the lymphatic system

Outline the differences between single vs dual circuit systems
?
Single circuits
- Advantages
  -** Blood passing through the gills is fully oxygenated when it moves into the tissues**
- Limitation
  - **In passing through the gills, blood loses much of its pressure developed by the contraction of the heart. This limits the rate of oxygen delivery to the rest of the body**
Dual circuits
- Effectively two heart pumps and two circulations
- The flow must be matched in the two circulations
- **More efficient, higher rate of oxygen supply to tissues**

Outline dual circulation
?
The LEFT side of the heart pumped OXYGENATE blood to the SYSTEMIC circulation
The RIGHT side pumps DEOXYGENATE blood to the PULMONARY circulation
Two separate vascular loops - both originate and terminate at the heart
The single direction of flow

Systemic veins, R atrium, R ventricle, Pulmonary Arteries, Lungs, Pulmonary veins, L Atrium, L Ventricle, Systemic arteries, capillary beds, systemic veins

PULMONARY VEINS CARRY OXYGENATE (multiple choice)

Outline the flow of blood
?
Flow THROUGH a tube requires a pressure difference -> fluid flows high to low pressure
Friction against blood vessels resists flow through blood vessels (tubes)
The force required to move a given volume of fluid through the tubes (in a specified period of time is the vascular resistance)

Outline the flow equation
?
Flow = pressure difference/resistance
Q = $\Delta$ p / R
Flow can be modified by changing pressure differences
Changing vascular resistance

Flow is proportional to the pressure difference. Not absolute pressures but is based of changes in pressure

Outline the resistance for a blood vessel
?
Resistance = $(8 * length * viscosity)/(\pi * radius^4)$
Resistance is inversely proportional to the radius of the vessel
Therefore, as vessel radius decreases resistance increases

Poiseilleus Law
?
$\Delta$ P $\pi$ $r^4$ / (8LV)

BLOOD VESSELS ARE ARRANGED IN SERIES AND PARALLEL

The total resistance of series
?
TN = T1 + T2 + ...

The total resistance in parallel
?
1/RT = 1/R1 + 1/R2
Lower than individual resistance

Outline resistance in networks of vessels
?
The total resistance in a series of blood vessels is equal to the sum of individual resistances of each segment
The greatest pressure drop will occur in the segment with the greatest resistance
Vascular beds in organs are often arranged in parallel
In a parallel network, the total resistance is lower than the resistance of individual segments

Outline the role of the heart
?
Two muscular pumps
Passive flow through organs
Right provides energy to push through pulmonary vessels
The left heart pump provides energy to push blood through systemic organs
Each side has an atrium and ventricle
Systole is the phase when the muscle cells are contracting
Diastole is when muscles relax
Left and right pumps are arranged in series

Outline the coordination of the pumping of the heart
?
Efficient pumping requires coordinated contraction of cardiac muscle cells
Action potential sweeps over the cell membrane
Achieved via gap junctions
Sinoatrial node is the pacemaker
