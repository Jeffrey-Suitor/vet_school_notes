## Intended Learning Outcomes
- be aware of the variation in size, shape and position of the heart in the main domestic mammal species

- be able to identify the external and internal anatomical features of the heart
- be able to identify the different parts and branches of the aorta within the thorax

## CRDO - L02

Thoracic cavity
- Cone shaped
- The truncated apex, the narrowest part is a thoracic inlet
- Bounded caudally by last ribs, 13th in dog and cat
- Diaphragm is convex and bounds inward
- Oriented craniodorsally to caudal ventrally
- The base of the heart near the first rib
- The apex of the heart neat last diaphragm
- The tricep muscle partially obscures the heart so need to draw the leg forward
- Sits slightly further to the left side because the right lung is larger than the left lung
- The heart sounds louder on the left side
- Lies in the mediastinum, form a complete wall
- Plicae vena cava envelopes caudal vena cava on way to heart

Outline the size of the heart
?
0.6% of total body weight
Post-natal increase in heart mass - mainly achieved by hypertrophy
Comparative aspects: cone-shaped in horses and ruminants, more globular in small animals
Slightly flattened cone
- Base - low dome, formed by left and right atria
- Great veins/arteries - enter/emerge from the base
- Apex - tapered portion of cone formed by left ventricle

Outline the structure of the pericardium
?
Serous sac enclosing the heart
Inner wall 
- A single layer of flattened mesothelium
- visceral pericardium
Outer wall 
- Inner parietal pericardium
- Outer fibrous pericardium
Pericardial cavity
Occupied y thin film of serous fluid-lubricant

What are the functions of the pericardium
?
Protective
Help maintain position
Minimise friction during cardiac cycle
Prevent over-distension of the heart
Pericardial effusion -> Overfilling
Pericarditis -> usually leads to right-sided heart failure
Pericardiocentesis normally taken at 4th or 5th intercostal space

What are the external features of the heart
?
Base - thin walled atria
Coronary groove
- Demarcates atria from ventricles
- Contains the main coronary vessels - often concealed by fat
The atrium has a free appendage - the auricle
Right and left auricles curve around the origin of the pulmonary trunk
Right auricle - most cranial part of the heart
Thicker walled right and left ventricles form a firm cone
position of the interventricular septum is marked by
- Left interventricular groove
- Right interventricular groove
- Apex - tip of the cone - part of the left ventricle

Outline the surfaces of the heart
?
The left lateral surface of the heart
- Left atrium and left ventricle
- The right ventricle and right auricle extend around the cranial border
The right lateral surface of the heart
- The right atrium and right ventricle
- left ventricle and left atrium extend around the caudal border

Outline the borders of the heart
?
Right ventricle lies as much cranially as to the right to the left ventricle
Cranial border of right ventricle is convex
Caudal border of left ventricle
- Carnivores - slightly convex
- Horse - almost straight
- Ruminants -slightly concave

Internal features of the heart
?
Right atrium
- Four main openings
  - Cranial vena cava
  - Caudal vena cava
  - Coronary sinus
  - Right atrioventricular opening
- Other variable openings
  - Small coronary veins
  - Azygous vein (in some species)
- Right atrium - the surface is smooth
Right auricle
- Surface is interlaced with pectinate muscles
- Vestiges of the fetal circulation
- Fossa ovalis
- Intervenous tubercle
Right ventricle
- Lumen - crescent-shaped
- Opening - guarded by the tricuspid valve
  - Three thin flap-like cusps
  - The free edge of cusp - restrained by chordae tendineae
  - Chordae tendineae arise from papillary muscles
  - Under normal circumstances, the interventricular septum, which divides the ventricles, contracts as part of the LV
  - Contracts base to apex
Right Ventricular Cavity
- Crossed by the right septomarginal trabeculae
- irregular surface - presence of trabeculae carneae
- Three papillary muscles:
  - Two from septum
  - Large one from the outer wall
- Outflow channel
  - Funnel-shaped conus arteriosus
  - Directs blood into the pulmonary trunk
  - Smooth walls
- The root of the pulmonary trunk increased in diameter

What are the features of the pulmonary valves
?
Pulmonary valve
- 3 semi lunar valvules - pockets
- 3 bulges in the wall of the pulmonary trunk - sinuses of the pulmonary trunk
- The pulmonary valve leaflets are much thinner structures than the aortic valve leaflets

What are the features of the left atrium
?
Usually 6 pulmonary veins (2 to 4)
Small coronary veins
Left A-V orifice into the left ventricle

What are the features of the left ventricle
?
Opening guarded by mitral valve (2 cusps)
2 papillary muscles, arising from the outer wall
Root for the aorta increased in diameter - aortic bulb

What are the features of the interventricular septum
?
2 components
- Thick muscular portion
- Thin membranous portion
  - Site of closure of the embryonic interventricular foramen

Outline the structure of the heart wall
?
Endocardium: Lines the lumen of the heart chambers
Myocardium: Is the thick middle layer of the heart. Composed of cardiac muscle
Epicardium: External surface layer of the heart - also called the visceral pericardium

What are the features of the aortic valves - 3 semi lunar valvules
?
The left coronary artery opens from the left aortic sinus
The right coronary artery opens from the right aortic sinus
Valvules of the left A-V and aortic valves thicket than in the right ventricle

Outline the cardiac skeleton
?
Plate - 2 triangular areas - trigones
reinforced by cartilage or bone
- Ox - 2 bones; Sheep - 1 bone (os cordis)
- Cat, Dog, Pig, Horse - Cartilage
You can feel it on the outside

Where to listen for the heart sounds
?
Left side is louder because closer to body wall
- 3rd = pulmonary valve
- 4th = Aortic valve
- 5th = Mitral valve
Right side
- 4th = Tricuspid
In horse the heart is positioned within 3rd to 6th ribs
Frediopericardial ligament in dog and cat, sternum and diaphragm
Heart ins horse almost vertical within the sternum with the long axis in a dorso ventral, only on the sternum

What are the systemic arteries
?
Aorta
- Main systemic arterial trunk
- Arises from the left ventricle
- Divided into 3 main segments
  - Ascending aorta (moving cranially)
  - Aortic arch (bend where it moves caudally)
  - Descending aorta (Where it moves caudally)
Ascending Aorta
- Very short, arises from the left ventricle
- Passes dorsally and cranially between the pulmonary trunk and the right atrium
- Supplies blood to the wall of the heart
  - Left coronary artery
  - Right coronary artery
Aortic arch
- Aorta makes a dorso-caudal u-turn
- Penetrates the pericardium
- Ascends within the mediastinum
- Reaches ~ 7th thoracic vertebrae
- Supplies blood to> Head, neck, shoulders, forelimbs and thoracic wall

What are the branches of the aortic arch
?
1 to 3 major branches - species variation
Two major vessels arise from the aortic arch
- Brachiocephalic trunk
- Left subclavian artery

What is the brachiocephalic trunk?
?
Larger than Left subclavian artery
Short ~ 4 cm
Passes cranio-obliquely to right ventral to the trachea
Branches
- L common carotid
- R common carotid
- R subclavian
