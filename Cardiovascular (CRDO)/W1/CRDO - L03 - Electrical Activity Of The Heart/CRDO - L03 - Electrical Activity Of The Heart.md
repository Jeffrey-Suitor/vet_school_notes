## CRDO - L03

How does the heartbeat
?
Contractions are triggered by action potentials sweeping across the cell membrane
The heart beats rhythmically due to AP it generates itself this property is called 'autohythmicity'
Two specialised cells
- Contractile cardiac muscle cells: do the mechanical work of pumping. They do not normally initiate their own AP
- Autorhythmic (pacemaker) cells: specialised for initiating and conducting the AP that contract the contractile cardiac muscle cells. They do not contract

Outline the resting potential of the contractile cardiomyocytes
?
All cells have electrical potential across their membranes, caused by the separation of electrical charges across the membrane
Cardiac muscle cells
- Fixed proteins (negative charge) inside the cells
- Cell membrane permeable to K+ ions - these move freely to balance charge
- The balance of K+ is controlled by opposing electrical and concentration gradients
- This creates a membrane potential of -90 mv
- **Resting membrane potential depends on differing K+ concentrations across the membrane**
Resting membrane potential dependent differing k+ concentrations across the membrane
Ions channels can be receptor or voltage operated
Voltage operated
- Controlled by changes in membrane potential
- Na+ channels in the generation of AP
- Once the channel is open ions enter passively down a concentration gradient

Action potential of cardio myocytes
?
4 = resting poentital
0 = Fast Na+ channel opens,
1 = Some potassium channels open briefly to bring potential back down
2 = Ca++ and Calcium channels (L type) open
3 = K+ Channels open

Outline the refractory period: a special feature of cardiac myocytes
?
AP are long - one AP per contraction
Extended absolute refractory state
Voltage-operated Na+ channels were inactivated at the end of Phase 0
- They can not reactivate until membrane potential drops
Cardiac muscle cannot be restimulated until contraction is almost over
Sustained maximal contraction tetanus cannot occur
Pumping blood requires alternate phases of contraction and relaxation

Outline the cardiac autorhythmic cells display pacemaker activity
?
The hear contracts as a result of AP it generates itself
This 'autorhythmicity' is a function of specialised pacemaker cells
They initiate AP that spread through the hear tot trigger rhythmic beating (without nervous stimulation)
Sinoatrial node (SA node): located in right atrial
Atrioventricular node (AV node): located at base of right atrium
Bundle of His: originates at the AV node, enters the IV septum, then divides into left and right bundle branches
Purkinje fibres: small terminal fibres that extend from bundle of His

Outline the pacemaker cell action potentials
?
Pacemaker cells do not have a constant resting potential
Their membrane potential slowly depolarises (drifts) between action potentials
Cyclically initiate APs that are conducted through the heart to trigger rhythmic beating with no nervous stimulation
Pacemaker potential -> slow depolarization -> unique sodium channels, funny channels
Permeability in pacemaker cells changes the permeability over time
Voltage-gated calcium channels (Transient also called T type) bring the second half of pacemaker potential to depolarization
Opening of L-type calcium channels causes rapid increase, the decrease is when they close

Outline the two different types of action potentials
?
Pacemaker = slow
Myocyte = fast
Slow action potentials
- Slow depolarisation
- Shorter plateau
- Unstable resting potential
- No voltage-operated Na+ channels
- The threshold for depolarisation is more positive (deu to dependence on voltage-operated Ca channels)
- Permeability to K+ does not remain constant between APs

Outline the different rates of depolarisation between autorhythmic tissues
?
Sa > Av > bundle of His > Purkinje
Tissues with a faster rate of depolarisation generate action potentials more frequently
Cells in the SA node have the fastest rate of AP initiation
AP is transmitted through the conduction system and via gap junctions to the rest of the myocardium
SA node is the pacemaker of the heart - the entire heart beats at the pace set by the SA node

Outline the anatomy of the conducting system of the heart
?
SA node
- Lateral wall of RA
- Near the junction of CrVC 
- Mass of nodal myocytes
- Microscopic
AV node
- The floor of RA at junction of the interatrial septum
- Microscopic
Bundle of HIS / Atrioventricular (AV) bundle
- Runs from AV node to dorsal IV septum
- Immediately divides into R and L branches
Right crus (R bundle branch)
- Runs to the apex in the subendocardium of the IV septum
- Branches to papillary muscles, outer wall of R ventricle
Left crus (L bundle branch)
- Subendocardial branches over the surface of L ventricle 
- Runs to teh apex, up the outer wall of L ventricle
- Papillary muscles on the outer wall
Purkinje fibres
- Final extensions of R and L bundle branches
- Network of subendocardial fibres
- Fibre bundles enclosed in CT
- Fibres pass into cardiac muscle cells

Outline the conduction system histology
?
Purkinje cells
- Specialised cardiac myocytes, not nerve cells
  - Large diameter
  - The pale central area (glycogen)
  - The marginalisation of myofibrils around the periphery
  - Chains of Purkinje cells make Purkinje fibres

Outline the role of intercalated disks
?
Cardiac muscle cells are connected to form branching fibres
Adjacent cells joined by intercalated discs
- Desmosome - mechanically holds the cell together
- Gap junction - Area that allow action potentials to spread quickly between cells
Impulses generate din one part of the heart spread quickly across the heart
Conduction velocity varies across the different tissues - slower through AV node
**All the cells contract or none do**

Outline the control of heart rate
?
SA node depolarises independently
Heart rate is influenced by neural and hormonal factors
The heart is innervated by both divisions so f the autonomic nervous system
- Sympathetic stimulation will increase HR
- Parasympathetic stimulation (vagus nerve) will decrease HR
Circulation adrenaline (hormonal factor) also increases HR

Outline the effect of sympathy on the heart
?
- Increased rate of depolarisation in SA node. - decrease time to reach the threshold
- Increases in inwards movement of Na+ and CA2+
- Also increases contractile strength; so both HR and force of contraction increase
- Sympathetic activity dominates during exercise or during emergency situations

Outline the effect of parasympathetic stimulation
?
Parasympathetic stimulation increases permeability to K= in the SA node - Increases K+ leaving the cell - a longer time to reach the threshold
Mediated by ACh - regulated K+ channels
Parasympathetic action dominates at rest

Outline the balance of heart rate
?
HR determined by the balance of sympathetic and parasympathetic effects
At rest, parasympathetic is dominant
The activity of these two branches of the autonomic nervous system is controlled at the CV control centre in the brainstem
Note: adrenaline (a hormone secreted by the adrenal gland) also increases heart rate - this reinforces the effect of the sympathetic nervous system on the heart
