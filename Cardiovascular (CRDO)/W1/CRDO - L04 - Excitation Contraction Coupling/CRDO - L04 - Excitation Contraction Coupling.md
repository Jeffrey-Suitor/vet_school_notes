# CRDO - L04 - Excitation Contraction Coupling

## Intended Learning Outcomes

- Explain how the electrical and mechanical activity of the heart are linked to achieve effective pumping.
- In particular, at the end of this lecture you should be able to:
  - Describe the cellular and subcellular structures responsible for cardiac muscle cell contraction
  - Identify salient features of cardiac muscle tissue and conducting tissue in prepared histological specimens
  - Define and describe the excitation-contraction process

## CRDO - L04

Outline the cardiac skeleton
?
Simple 2D terms
FIbrous plate with five  holes
- One fibrous ring for each of
- Left AV valve
- Right AV valve
- Aortic semi-lunar valve
- Pulmonic semi-lunar valve
- The AV bundle
Functions of the cardiac skeleton
- Electrophysiological discontinuity
- Attachments for atrial and ventricular myocardium
- Strong yet flexible support for valvular openings
Plate - 2 triangular - trigones
Reinforced by cartilage or bone
- Ox - 2 bones
- Sheep - 1 bone (os cordis)
- Cat, Dog, Pig, Horse - cartilage

What are the layers of the heart?
?
Endocardium (Within)
- Endothelium
- Inner subendothelial
- Outer subendothelial layer
Myocardium (muscle)
- Bundles of cardiac muscle cells
Epicardium (upon/above)
- Mesothelial cells of the visceral pericardium
- Subepicardial connective tissue

Fat is found on epicardium but not endocardium

What's special about cardiac myocytes
?
Abundant mitochondrial
Dependent on aerobic respiration
- No rest periods
- No oxygen debt possibly

Histology of cardiac muscle
?
How does it differ from skeletal muscle
- Intercalated discs
- Central nuclei (usually one but sometimes two) with perinuclear space
- branched fibres
- Good blood supply

Intercalated discs
?
Intercalated discs
- Structurally attached at desmosomes
- Electrically connected at gap junctions
Cell membrane invaginations: T tubules
Sarcoplasmic reticulum in apposition with T tubules
Purkinje fibres: specialised conducting cells

Outline the relationship between calcium and excitation-contraction coupling
?
20% of the rise in intracellular Ca enters cells through VO channels
80% of the rise in intracellular Ca contributed by release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum

Outline excitation-contraction coupling
?
Action potential conducted across the myocyte membrane and down T tubule leads to:
- Opening of VO Ca channels
- Entry of Ca to cell
- Increase in intracellular Ca that
Stimulates release of Ca from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (Ca sensitive release channel - ryanodine receptor channels) that initiates contraction

Outline the generation of tension in cardiac myocytes
?
Regulatory protein complex
- Tropomyosin
- Troponin
- Prevent interaction between actin and myosin
Calcium switch
- Increased intracellular calcium
- Ca causes tropomyosin to move aside
- Myosin-actin cross-bridges form
Contraction (power stroke)
- Energy (ATP) supplied by ATP bound to myosin

Outline Ca release from SR
?
Ca release from SR contributes to the plateau phase of the AP, and hence to the refractory period

Outline relaxation of the heart
?
Active pumps return Ca to 
- Sarcoplasmic reticulum
- Extracellular fluid (less important)
Calcium exchanged for extracellular Na
Intracellular Calcium concentration falls
Myocyte relaxes

Outline how tension generation is related to Ca++ release
?
The amount of Ca++ release (and hence the force of contraction) depends on how much Ca++ release (and hence the force of contraction) depends on how much Ca++ is stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum and the number of release channels activated
The tension generated is directly related to intracellular calcium levels
The tension generated also depends on the length of the myocyte prior to contraction

What are the contraction types in cardiac muscle
?
Isotonic contraction: activating an unrestrained muscle causes it to shorten without force development, as it has nothing to develop force against. Under these conditions, a muscle shortens with maximal velocity
Isometric contraction: the muscle develops at a fixed length - a measure of the muscle's maximum ability to develop tension (eg. cardiac contraction before valves open)

Outline the effect of cell length and contraction force
?
Cell length determines the overlap of thick and thin filaments
The length of the relaxed cell is determined by the amount of blood in the ventricle
At a certain length overlap between thick and thin filaments is optimal and for a given rise in Ca will result in maximal tension
Normal cell length is less than maximal

Outline the length-tension curve

Outline contractility
?
The amount of tension that can be developed at any given stretch of cardiac
Contractility can be adjusted - physiologically and pathologically
Inotropes are agents (physiological or pharmacological) that alter contractility

Contractility is increased by an increase in  intracellular calcium concentration
Intracellular calcium can be modulated by
- Receptor-operated Ca channels on the cell membrane
- Ryanodine channels on SR
Modulation can be 
- Physiological (Noradrenaline, adrenaline at B receptor)
- Pharmacological (ionotropic drugs)
