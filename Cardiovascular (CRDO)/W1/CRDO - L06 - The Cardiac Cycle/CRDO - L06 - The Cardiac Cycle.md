## CRDO - L06

Outline the role of heart values
?
Cardiac cycle: a sequence of coordinated electrical and mechanical events that ensure effective cardiac pump function
Ventricles must repetitively fill and empty
Blood must flow in a forward direction: valves ensure that this is the case

Where are the valves
?
Atrioventricular valves
- Between the atria and ventricles
- Right heart - tricuspid valve
- Left heart - mitral (bicuspid) valve
Outlet valves
- Between the ventricles and the major arteries
- Right heart - pulmonary valve
- Left heart - aortic semilunar valve
Movements of valve leaflets are essentially passive
Orientation of valves is responsible for unidirectional flow

Outline the function of heart valves
?
The valve opens when the pressure in the proximal chamber exceeds the pressure in the distal chamber
The valve closes when the pressure in the distal chamber exceeds the pressure in the proximal chamber
Papillary muscles do not help close the valvular orifice but prevent excessive bulging of valves into atrial chambers during ventricular contraction

Outline the steps of the cardiac cycle
?
SA node initiates action potential and hence heartbeat
Atrial systole - ventricular filling complete
Ventricular systole
- Isovolumetric contraction
- Rapid ejection
- Reduced ejection
Ventricular diastole
- Isovolumetric relaxation
- Rapid ventricular filling
- Reduced ventricular filling

Outline the end of diastole
?
All chambers relaxed
AV valves open (atrial pressure slightly higher than ventricular pressure)
Pulmonary and aortic valves closed (aortic and pulmonary arterial pressure higher than ventricular pressure)
Begins when SA node initiates an action potential
Results in P wave of atrial depolarization

Outline the atrial systole
?
Contraction of atria completes the ventricular filling
Up to 80% of ventricular filling occurs due to venous pressure 
Atrial contraction only 20% of ventricular filling at rest
As heart rate rises, atrial contribution rises, as less time in diastole for filling to occur
No valves between the atria and great veins, so some regurgitation occurs. The a wave of venous pressure reflects atrial systole
Contraction of atria completes ventricular filling
End diastolic volume - the volume of blood in the ventricle at the end of atrial systole (contraction)
End diastolic volume (EDV)

Outline ventricular systole
?
1. Isovolumetric
  - The onset of ventricular systole causes an increase in ventricular pressure
  - Ventricular depolarization is associated with the QRS complex of the ECG
  - A rise in pressure causes AV valves to close, but 0.2-0.3 seconds is required for the ventricle to build up pressure to open semi-lunar (aortic and pulmonary) valves against aortic pressure
  - Increasing pressure causes AV valves to bulge into the atria, causing an atrial pressure wave (c wave)
2. Rapid ejection
  - Ventricular pressure rises above diastolic arterial pressure, (80mm on left, 8 mm in right), semilunar valves open and blood flows into arteries
  - Flow into arteries is initially very rapid (50% of emptying occurs in the first quarter of systole)
3. Reduced ejection
  - Almost no blood flows from the ventricle to the arteries, yet the ventricle remains contracted
  - Aortic pressure begins to fall as blood leaves the aorta and large vessels larger than it is entered from the left ventricle
  - Eventually, flow briefly reverses causing aortic and pulmonary valves to close
  - Abrupt close of the aortic valve causes a transient dip in pressure, the dicrotic notch, as a small volume of blood flows back to fill the leaves of the valve
  - Active contraction ceases and muscle repolarizes associated with T wave of ECG
  - End of ventricular systole, build-up of blood (from veins) in atria, causes atrial v wave

What are the key terms associated with ventricular systole?
?
End systolic volume (ESV) = volume of blood in the ventricle at end of ventricular systole
End diastolic volume (EDV) = the volume of blood in the ventricle at the end of ventricular filling
Stroke volume (SV) - volume of blood ejected, SV = EDV - ESV
Ejection fraction (EF) = the proportion of EDV ejected: EF - SV/EDV

Outline ventricular diastole
?
Period of ventricular relaxation
At rest, diastole is twice the length of systole but this decreases with increasing HR
Isovolumetric relaxation
- Following the closure of outflow valves, ventricles relax rapidly, but ventricular pressure is still greater than atrial pressure so valves remain closed
Rapid ventricular filling
- Ventricular pressure falls below atrial pressure, AV valves open, and atrial pressure falls rapidly as ventricles fill
- This is assisted by the elastic recoil of ventricular walls effectively sucking blood in
Reduced refilling
Ventricles relax completely and refilling slows

Outline the pressure-volume loop
?
Describe changes in disease states

Outline pressure waves in the systemic arteries
?
Ejection of blood from the heart results in pulsatile flow in the arteries
Systolic pressure = peak pressure at the point of maximum ejection of blood from the ventricle
Diastolic pressure = pressure when outlet valves are closed
Pulse pressure = Systolic pressure - Diastolic pressure

Describe the right heart
?
The heart has a single electrical system, so similar mechanical events occur simultaneously in both sides of the heart
Right and left pumps are arranged in a series of flows and stroke volumes must be equal
The major difference is in the magnitude of systolic pressures. Lungs have much lower resistance to flow, so less arterial pressure required
Atrial pressure waves are transmitted in a retrograde fashion to the great veins and can be useful in clinical assessment

Outline the heart sounds
?
The first and second heart sounds mark the beginning and end of ventricular systole
First sound - associated with the closure of AV valves (reverberation due to sudden cessation of blood flow, reverse flow and vibrations of chordae tendinae)
Second sound. - closure of outlet valves
Third sound
- Generally weak and difficult to hear except in horse
- Mid diastole (filling)
- The vibration of the ventricular wall due to the entry of blood to the ventricle
Fourth Sound
- Occurs with atrial contraction
- In the rush of blood to the ventricles with atrial contraction
- Similar to the third heart sound

Outline abnormal heart sounds
?
Murmurs
- Caused by turbulent blood flow
- Murmurs can reflect valve defects
Stenosis
- Valve produces a narrowing of the orifice, so that flow through the narrowed orifice is turbulent
Incompetence
- The valve leaks blood while closed, and this regurgitation is heard as a dull roar
Gallop rhythm
- A duplication splitting of the first or second heart sound, producing a triple instead of. double sound (in humans associated with severe disease. Normally in dairy cows, particularly if low HR)

Outline key measures of performance in the heart
?
Stroke volume (SV): The volume of blood ejected from the ventricle with one beat. EDV - ESV
Heart rate (HR): number of beats per minute
Cardiac Output (CO) The volume of blood pumped by the heart per minute (CO = HR x SV)

Outline the consequences of failing valves
?
The incompetence of valve -> regurgitation: backward flow of blood during systole
Stenosis of valve -> impaired filling during diastole
Both will produce murmurs - but may be at different times in the cardiac cycle

Outline pan-systolic murmur
?
This means it occurs at the same time as arterial pulse because regurgitation is occurring as the ventricles contract
Regurgitation will result in a reduced ejection fraction
Reduced stroke volume
Reduced cardiac output
Poor exercise tolerance due to poor cardiac output
Mitral valve issues
Mitral valve regurgitation leads to increased left atrial volume and left atrial pressure
Increased pulmonary venous pressure
Increased pulmonary venous capillary hydrostatic pressure
Increased net transcapillary filtration
Pulmonary oedema which explains increased respiration rate at rest
