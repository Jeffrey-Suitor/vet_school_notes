# Q1
In a blood vessel, flow is directly proportional to pressure gradient along the vessel.

In a blood vessel, flow is directly proportional to radius of the vessel.

Blood velocity is lowest in capillaries.

Most solutes move out of capillaries by diffusion.

The forces increasing net filtration in a capillary are capillary hydrostatic pressure and interstitial oncotic pressure.

The forces increasing net reabsorption into a capillary are interstitial hydrostatic pressure and plasma oncotic pressure.

Capillary hydrostatic pressure is greater at the arterial end of the capillary than the venous end.
