# CRDO - L05 - Observing The Electrical Activity Of The Heart

## Intended Learning Outcomes
- Describe the cellular
- Describe the concept of Einthovenâ€™s triangle, vector analysis and the mean electrical axis of the heart.
- State the relationship between the electrical events of cardiac excitation and the P, QRS, and T waves, the PR interval and the ST segment of the electrocardiogram.
- Define the terms arrhythmia, bradycardia, tachycardia, flutter, fibrillation, and AV block, and understand in general terms, their mechanisms.

## CRDO - L05

What is the basis of the electrocardiogram?
?
The body acts as a volume conductor
When cardiac muscle depolarises, extracellular currents between depolarised and resting cells cause potential differences that can be measured
Current flows from negative to positive
The wavefront of depolarisation can be thought of as a series of electrical dipoles (regions of charge separation)
Each individual dipole is orientated in the direction of the local wavefront movement
The net dipole movement at any instant in time points in the general direction of wavefront movement at that instant
The magnitude of the dipole depends on 
- How many cells are depolarising at that instant
- Vector analysis of simultaneous dipoles

Outline Einthoven's hypothesis
?
Electrical forces of the heart originate in a small area at the centre of a homogenous volume conductor
The attachments of the arms and legs to the trunk are points equidistant from each other
The limbs behave as a linear conductor connected to the trunk so that an electrode placed anywhere on an extremity is equivalent to one placed at the junction with the trunk
Electrodes placed on each arm and leg are then considered to be located at the apices of an equilateral triangle, with the heart at its centre
Differences in potential recorded between these points represent the project of vector forces originating from a dipole in the heart, onto lead lines drawn between its apices

Outline the ECG leads
?
Lead 1 = right arm -ve, left arm +ve
Lead 2 = right arm -ve, left leg +ve
Lead 3 = left leg +ve, left arm -ve
Refers to particular configuration not individual electronics on patient
The +ve electrodes are placed so that depolarisation typically spreads toward
By convention, positive current flow indicates current flow from a negative to a positively charged area
The trace records the difference in potential between two electrodes
Amplifier and chart recorder

What is the limitation of Einthoven's hypothesis
?
The body does not form a true homogenous electrical conductor, so the dispersion of electrical currents is uniform
The heart is often not in the centre of an equilateral triangle, so recording electrodes are not equidistant from the heart
In quadrupeds
- Limb arrangement is much less like an equilateral triangle
- The anatomical attachment of forelimbs to the body is different
- Moving limbs alters the amplitude and direction of potentials

Outline the waveform of the ECG
?
Represents the net vector of depolarisation and repolarisation of the heart over time
The shape of the trace depends on the net direction of the wavefront of depolarisation and the amount of tissue that is depolarising

Outline the mean electrical axis of the heart
?
Is the orientation of the ECG vector at its maximum amplitude
Direct + Mass of tissue determines the orientation

Outline the alterations in heart rhythm
?
Arrhythmia - alteration in rate or rhythm
Bradycardia - slowing of heart rate
Tachycardia - increase in heart rate
Sinus Bradycardia - slowing governed by SA node (due to increased vagal tone)
- Observed ins sleeping individuals, and well-trained athletes
Sinus tachycardia - increases in HR governed by SA node (due to increased sympathetic tone)
- Normal during exercise, anxiety states, fever
Sinus arrhythmia
- Variation in heart rate synchronous with respiration
- HR increases towards end of the inspiration
- HR decreases towards end of the expiration
- Common and normal observation at rets
- At higher heart rates sinus arrhythmia disappears

Outline abnormal rhythms resulting from block in impulse conduction
?
Sinoatrial block: impulse blocked before it enters atrial muscle so no P wave
Atrioventricular block
 - Transmission through AV node either slowed or completely impeded
 - P waves are not always related to QRS complex

Outline atrioventricular blocks
?
First degree
- Usually slows conduction through AV node
- Detected by abnormally long Pr interval
Second degree
- Some but not all impulses are transmitted through the AV node
- The atrial rate is often faster than the ventricular by a certain rate
- Depending on the ventricular rate may not be a serious problem
Third degree
- Complete block, with complete dissociation of P and QRS complex
- Some area in the ventricles (often in Bundle Branch) assumes the pacemaker role
- Ventricular rate likely to be slower than normal

Outline abnormal rhythms caused by premature beats
?
Premature atrial contractions 
- An area of the atria escapes normal pacemaker domination and initiates a heartbeat
- May or may not be followed by a ventricular contraction
Premature ventricular contractions (VPCs)
- Not preceded by a P wave
- Often followed by missed beat as muscle is refractory when the impulse arrives
- Premature beat has reduced stroke volume, delayed but larger than normal stroke volume

Outline Paroxysmal Tachycardias
?
A tachycardia arising from an ectopic pacemaker
Onset and termination are normally abrupt
May rise in 
- Atria or AV node
  - Called supraventricular as they are indistinguishable
- Ventricles
  - Called Paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia
  - More serious: ventricular filling and contraction incomplete
  - May progress to fibrillation

Outline fibrillation
?
Rapid. and completely disorganised conduction pathways
Atrial fibrillation leads to 
- Disorganised atrial activity and conduction
- irregular ventricular rhythm
- No P waves on trace
- Reversible with medication
Ventricular fibrillation
- Much more serious
- May result from electric shock, major myocardial infarction, (loos of blood supply) certain anaesthetic agents, handling the heart during surgery
- Loss of consciousness within a few seconds
- Resuscitate with electric shock - place entire myocardium in refractory state and give SA node change to take over as pacemaker again
