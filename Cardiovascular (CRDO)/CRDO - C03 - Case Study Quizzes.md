Question 1

1 / 1 pts

What is a "pulse deficit"?

  An abnormally weak pulse 

  An abnormal variation in the pulse rate 

Correct!

  Lack of a pressure pulse for each heartbeat 

  An abnormally low pulse rate 

Question 2

1 / 1 pts

Which of the following is a potential explanation for Jack's pale gums?

  Anaemia (low haemoglobin concentration in the blood) 

  Hypoxaemia (low partial pressure of oxygen in the blood) 

  Poor tissue perfusion as a result of low cardiac output 

  Vasoconstrictionof blood vessels in his gums 

Correct!

  All of the above 

Question 3

1 / 1 pts

Based on the point of greatest intensity of Jack's  heart murmur, which heart valve is the most likely to be involved?

  Aortic 

  Pulmonic 

Correct!

  Mitral 

  Tricuspid 

Question 4

1 / 1 pts

What do you think is the most likely cause of the "crackles" heard on thoracic auscultation?

  Referred gastrointestinal noises. 

Correct!

  Opening of the small airways on inspiration that have been compressed by fluid accumulation in the interstitial space. 

  Air in the pleural cavity
  
# Quiz 2
Question 1

1 / 1 pts

Myocardial failure results in decreased contractility of the heart. Decreased contractility results in a reduction in **stroke volume**. What is stroke volume?

  The volume of blood pumped out by the heart in a minute 

Correct!

  The volume of blood pumped by the ventricle wth each time it beats 

  The volume of blood contained within the venous system 

Question 2

0 / 1 pts

Cardiac output = stroke volume x heart rate, so as a result of a reduction in stroke volume there is a corresponding reduction in cardiac output. As cardiac output falls, does the blood pressure tend to:

You Answered

  Increase? 

Correct Answer

  Decrease? 

  Stay the same? 

Question 3

1 / 1 pts

The change in blood pressure leads to compensatory mechanisms, that lead to water retention. This results in an increase in the amount of blood returning to the heart, which is known as an increase in:

Correct!

  preload 

  afterload 

Question 4

0 / 1 pts

Over time this increase in volume leads to ongoing stretch of the myocardium and the development of hypertrophy (increase in size of the cardiac muscle cells). This in turn leads to an increase in end-diastolic diameter and end-diastolic volume within the ventricles. What does the Frank-Starling Law of the Heart predict as a result?

Which of the following statements is true?

Correct Answer

  The more the heart muscle is stretched during filling, the greater the force of contraction and the greater the quantity of blood pumped into the aorta. 

You Answered

  The more the heart muscle is stretched during filling, the smaller the force of contraction and the smaller the quantity of blood pumped into the aorta 

Question 5

1 / 1 pts

In the short term an increase in cardiac output occurs, but over time the myocardial failure may become so severe that the cardiovascular system can no longer compensate and pressure within the ventricles increases.

If the pressure increases in the ventricles, then what happens to the hydrostatic pressure in the capillary beds upstream (i.e. the blood in the organs draining into each ventricle)?

Correct!

  It increases 

  It decreases 

  It stays the same 

Question 6

1 / 1 pts

As a result of these hydrostatic pressure changes, there is net fluid movement out of the capillaries and pulmonary oedema results as seen with Jack.

The diagram below shows two representations of the Frank-Starling curve - which curve represents the normal heart and which curve represents the failing heart?

![](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/189965/files/15182413/preview)

Correct!

  Curve A is normal, curve B is failing 

  Curve A is failing, curve B is normal 

Question 7

0.5 / 1 pts

What reasons are there for the mitral valve deficiency and the consequent heart murmur in cases of dilated cardiomyopathy?

You Answered

  The mitral valve becomes deformed as a result of abnormal blood flow 

Correct!

  As the ventricle gets bigger, the cardiac skeleton is distorted and so the valve leaflets do not meet in the middle 

Correct!

  The papillary muscles also become deformed by the increase in ventricular size pulling the valve leaflets out of place 

Question 8

1 / 1 pts

How does ventricular tachycardia cause a severe drop in cardiac output?

Correct!

  The rapid ventricular rate does not allow adequate ventricular filling 

Correct!

  Atrial contractions are no longer coordinated with ventricular contractions 

Correct!

  Ventricular depolarization no longer occurs in a coordinated manner 

Question 9

1 / 1 pts

What are the three most serious life-threatening problems that Jack is facing (select 3)?

  Kidney failure 

Correct!

  Arrhythmia 

  Fluid accumulation in the abdomen (ascites) 

Correct!

  Pulmonary oedema 

Correct!

  Myocardial failure
