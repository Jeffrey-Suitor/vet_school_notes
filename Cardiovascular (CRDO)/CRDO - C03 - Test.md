Question 3

1 / 1 pts

When positioning a dog for a ventrodorsal chest radiograph, the dog's sternal surface will be in contact with the table.  

  True 

  False 

Question 4

1 / 1 pts

In a lateral chest radiograph, which of the following parts of the cardiac silhouette makes the greatest sternal contact?

  right ventricle 

  left ventricle 

  left atrium 

  right atrium 

Question 5

1 / 1 pts

Fractional shortening is a measure of  

  contractility 

  cardiac output 

  stroke volume 

  cardiac filling 

Question 6

1 / 1 pts

Ventricular premature complexes 

  do not significantly impact on cardiac output. 

  originate in the atrioventricular node rather than the sinoatrial node. 

  represent depolarisation of the ventricles that originates in an ectopic pacemaker. 

  originate in ventricular myocytes but follow normal conduction pathways. 

Question 7

1 / 1 pts

Which of the following parameters is a physiological determinant of stroke volume?

  end diastolic volume 

  QRS amplitude 

  cardiac output 

  heart rate 

Question 8

1 / 1 pts

Ventricular tachycardia has little impact on cardiac output, because 80% of cardiac filling occurs without the contribution of the atria.  

  True 

  False 

Question 9

1 / 1 pts

The primary functional defect that resulted in decline in cardiac output in Jack's case could best be described as

  reduced contractility of cardiac myocytes leading to reduced ejection fraction 

  ventricular tachycardia leading to weak pulse and pulse deficits 

  mitral valve regurgitation leading to reduced ejection fraction 

  Pulmonary congestion leading to poor oxygen exchange 

Question 10

1 / 1 pts

The improvement in Jack's condition when he was administered furosemide can be explained by which of the following mechanisms?

  improved gas exchange as a consequence of reduced pulmonary congestion 

  increased stroke volume 

  reduced total peripheral resistance and hence reduced afterload 

  increased venous return that boosts cardiac output 

Question 11

1 / 1 pts

Which of the following changes in cardiac function would result directly from Jack's treatment with the inotrope pimobendan?

  a reduction in ejection fraction 

  a decrease in preload 

  an increase in preload 

  an increase in fractional shortening 

Question 12

1 / 1 pts

When Mrs Daniels revisits with Jack two weeks after commencing his treatment, she reports that his respiratory rate when asleep is 30 breaths per minute.  This is within the normal range for respiratory rate in dogs.  

  True 

  False
