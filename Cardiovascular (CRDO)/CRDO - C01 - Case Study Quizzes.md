# Quiz 2

Question 1

1 / 1 pts

What part of the GI tract is most likely to be affected by a penetrating metallic gastro-intestinal foreign body? Give a reason for your answer (record in your wiki).

Correct!

  reticulum 

  rumen 

  omasum 

  abomasum 

  small intestine 

  large intestine 

Question 2

1 / 1 pts

Which of the following best explains the distension of the jugular veins observed in this cow?  

  High blood pressure related to the increase in heart rate 

Correct!

  Elevated venous pressure as a result of compression of the right ventricle 

  Compression of the left ventricle due to inflammatory discharge into the heart chamber 

  Stretching of the pericardium as a result of inflammation 

Question 3

1 / 1 pts

Oedema may result from  

  a decrease in plasma protein levels 

  a decrease in output from the right heart 

  an increase in vascular permeability 

Correct!

  all of the above 

Question 4

1 / 1 pts

Which of the following is not a function of the pericardium?  

  stabilisation of the heart in the thorax 

Correct!

  

contributing to cardiac filling by means of "cardiac suction"

  minimising friction during contraction 

  providing protection for the heart 

Question 5

0 / 1 pts

Because of its relationships within the thorax, the right ventricle is more susceptible to external compression than the left ventricle.  

You Answered

  True 

Correct Answer

  False 

Question 6

1 / 1 pts

The clinical signs of traumatic reticulopericarditis relate to right heart function because  

  foreign bodies are more likely to penetrate the right side of the heart 

  the right heart is closer to the reticulum and rumen 

  it is easier to recognise the clinical signs of right heart failure than left heart failure in a cow 

Correct!

  the right heart wall is thinner and more easily compressed

Question 1

1 / 1 pts

Place the following events in their correct sequence to explain the development of submandibular oedema in this cow 

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Display Order|Correct Order|
|## **1. increased fluid content in extracellular space- oedema**|8|
|## **2. penetration of pericardial sac by foreign body**|1|
|## **3. increased net filtration in capillary beds**|7|
|## **4. increased hydrostatic pressure in great veins leading to distension of the jugular vein**|6|
|## **5. reduced filling of right ventricle during diastole**|5|
|## **6.inflammatory response to contaminated foreign body**|2|
|## **7.fibrinopurulent discharge accumulates in pericardial space**|3|
