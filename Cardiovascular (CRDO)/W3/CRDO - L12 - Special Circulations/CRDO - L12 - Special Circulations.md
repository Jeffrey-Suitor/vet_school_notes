## CRDO - L12

What are the special circulations?
?
Coronary
Pulmonary
Cutaneous
Cerebral circulation

Outline coronary circulation
?
Supplies oxygen to the heart - critically important
Must deliver oxygen at a. high rate or meet myocardial demand (dramatic increase during exercise)
Left and right coronary arteries
- Each has circumflex and interventricular branches
The coronary arteries are the first branches of the aorta
- The left coronary artery opens from the L aortic sinus
- The right coronary artery opens from the R aortic sinus

Outline the left coronary artery
?
opens from the left aortic sinus
passes laterally beneath the left auricle
Divides into 
- Left (paraconal) interventricular artery
  - Lies in the left IV groove
- Left circumflex artery
  - Lies in the circular coronary groove

Outline the right coronary artery
?
Opens from the right aortic sinus
Passes laterally beneath right auricle
Divides into 
- Right (or subsinuosal) IV artery
  - Lies in the right IV groove
- Right circumflex artery
- Lies in the circular coronary groove

Outline the differences in coronary circulation between species for dogs and ruminants
?
Origin of the right interventricular artery (dog and ruminants or horse and pig)
R interventricular artery arises from L coronary artery
Left coronary artery supplies:
- All IV septum
- All L ventricle
- Regions of the R ventricle adjoining the L and R interventricular groove
The right coronary artery supplies the remainder of the right ventricle
L coronary carries 80% of coronary arterial flow

Outline the coronary species variation for horse and pig
?
A right interventricular artery from the RIGHT coronary artery
Left coronary artery supplies
- Most of the IV septum
- Most of the L ventricle
- Little of the R ventricle
Right coronary artery supplies
- Part of IV septum
- Regions of the L ventricle adjoining the R interventricular
- Most of the right ventricle
Both coronary arteries similar in size

Outline the microcirculation of the heart
?
Most vascular part of the myocardium
- Subendocardial plexus -> extensive network of arterioles and capillaries

Outline how myocardial papillary density is important
?
very high density
Reduced diffusion distance: facilitates rapid O2 transport
Coronary blood flow/gram tissue: 10 times the whole body average

Outline venous drainage of the heart
?
Great cardiac vein and coronary sinus
Great cardiac veins: ascends L IV groove around L coronary groove -> coronary sinus on R side
Coronary sinus:
- Opens into R atrium
- Carries 75% of total coronary flow
Small coronary veins
- Numerous, small, open directly into all four chambers of the heart

Outline control of coronary blood flow
?
Increased oxygen required at increased cardiac work rates supplied by increased coronary blood flow
metabolic (active) hyperaemia: Coupling of blood flow to demand for oxygen
- The myocardium releases metabolic by-products in proportion to the work rate (adenosine)
- Acts as a local vasodilator -> increased coronary blood flow
- Sympathetic NS stimulation causes coronary vasculature indirectly by increasing cardiac work rate (increase heart rate and increase contractility)

Outline systole obstruction of coronary blood flow
?
2/3 of coronary arteries are intramural
Intramural vessels compressed during systole
Especially during the isovolumetric contraction phase
80% of coronary blood flow occurs during diastole

Outline the use of beta blockers in heart disease
?
Especially in cats
Slows heart rate -> reduces cardiac oxygen demand; and
Lengthens the interval of good perfusion of coronary arteries

Outline pulmonary circulation
?
Pulmonary circulation receives the output of the right ventricle
Supplies the alveolar capillaries involved in gas exchange
Control mechanisms exist to perfuse each alveolus in proportion to the gas supply
Blood flow matches the local gas supply
Blood flow will distribute preferentially to well-oxygenated regions of the lungs

Outline pulmonary circulation
?
Pulmonary arteries
Pulmonary trunk
- Arises from conus arteriosus of R ventricle
- Bends caudally over the base of the heart
- Divides caudal to the aortic arch
- Gives rise to L and R pulmonary arteries
Pulmonary veins
- Only veins carry oxygenated blood
- Conduct blood to the left atrium
- Have no valves
- The pattern of disturbing usually corresponds to the number of pulmonary lobes

How does pulmonary circulation differ from systemic
?
Pressure is low due to low pulmonary vascular resistance
- vessels more compliant
- Arteries and arterioles shorter and thinner walled
- The basal tone is low
- Sympathetic vasomotor nerves play no major role
- Metabolic vasodilation has no role
  - Alveolar perfusion vastly exceeds the metabolic demand
Alveolar hypoxia is a potent constrictor of small pulmonary arteries
- Blood flow to poorly ventilated alveoli decreases
- Blood flow to better-ventilated areas of the lung increases
- Optimises local ventilation:perfusion ratios
- Note in the systemic circulation, local hypoxia causes vasodilation

Describe cutaneous blood flow
?
Cutaneous blood flow plays an important role in thermoregulation -> regulates core temperature
Heat is lost by radiation, conduction, convection and evaporation of sweat
Dermis well vascularised, and the epidermis is avascular
Supplied by
- Superficial
- Middle
- Deep vascular plexuses
Superficial and deep vascular beds
- Counter-current heat exchange mechanisms
Warm conditions: blood perfuses superficial capillary beds -> heart loss via superficial veins
Cold conditions: peripheral vasoconstriction -> flow to deep capillaries and deep veins: countercurrent heat exchange between arteries and veins conserves heat
Arteriovenous anastomosis causes more heap loss

Outline arteriovenous anastomosis
?
Can feel cats hear to feel and see different levels of anastomosis

Outline the cerebral blood flow
?
The brain accounts for nearly 20% of resting oxygen consumption
due to high oxygen -> exquisitely sensitive hypoxia
- Consciousness lost after a few seconds of ischaemia
- The primary role of cerebral circulation is to maintain oxygen delivery to the brain at all costs

Outline the common carotid arteries
?
Extend up the neck along the trachea
Branch at the atlantooccipital joint into 
- Internal carotid -> intracranial circulation
- external carotid -> extracranial circulation

Outline the vertebral arteries (L and R)
- The first branch of subclavian
- Extends cranially through the transverse foramen of the anterior 6 cervical vertebrae
- Fuses with occipital artery -> cerebrospinal artery

Outline the circle of Willis
?
Cerebrospinal arteries (L and R) fuse to form the basilar artery
Circle of Willis
Basilar artery anastomoses with the internal carotid artery, forming the Circle of Willis
The Circle of Willis supplies the brain with oxygenated blood
Artery-to-artery anastomosis: provides collateral circulation 
Preserves cerebral perfusion if a carotid artery or vertebral artery (or their branches) are obstructed
Safeguard arterial supply of brain
Brain microcirculation consists of functional end arteries -> Blockage causes local ischaemia

Outline how the cerebral capillaries form tight blood-brain barrier
?
BBB functions to 
- Protect the cerebral neurons from interference from circulating solute and pathogens
- Maintain a tightly controlled pH
- Prevent washout of neurotransmitters
Lipid soluble molecules (oxygen, carbon dioxide, general anaesthetic drugs) diffuse freely across capillaries
Created by specialised endothelial junctions
Endothelial cells have closed intercellular tight junctions
Thick basement membrane
Surrounded by 'end feet' from astrocytes

What are the major veins of the head
?
External jugular
Internal jugular
Vertebral vein
All drain -> cranial vena cava -> right atrium

Outline the external jugular vein
?
Begins near the angle of the jaw with the union of
- Maxillary vein: drains deeper and caudal structures of the heads
- Linguofacial vein - drains superficial and rostral structures
Superficial - passes down the neck in jugular groove
Commonly used for venipuncture
