1. Hole in blood vessel wall
2. Vasoconstriction (Instant)
3. Primary plug (Sec/Min) -> Endothelial cells
4. Definitive Plug (Min/Hr) -> Longer lasting and stays on longer, made of fibrin, coagulation and clotting cascade. More stable and longer lasting
5. Fibrinolysis and Repair (Days)

Reduces flow but doesn't stop it
Endothelin from the endothelial cells
Nociceptor pain receptors lead to vasoconstriction

1. Platelets from everywhere are recruited to exposed collagen, basement membrane, but mostly collagen. Good circulation means platelets can't stick unless they have VWF (Von Wieban Factor). 
2. Activation -> Shape change -> aggregation

200 000 - 500 000 x 10^9 / L
Dense granules appear dark (chocolate)
Alpha and dense granules contain compounds important for the repair (Ca2++, ADP, Clotting factors)

T/F in low flow, low-pressure platelets do not need vWF::True
Damaged endothelial cells release vWF
Cats platelets carry vWF
Some in circulation with factor 8

GP1b to bind to vWF
Shape change releases alpha granules and expresses new receptors including
- 2B3A
- Fibrinogen (Factor 1)
Platelet aggregation is triggered by fibrinogen
Number of different agonists for platelet activation (vWF, Collagen, thrombin, Adrenaline)
Switching on phospholipase enzymes
Arachidonic acid leads to TXA2 which is a powerful vasoconstrictor

ADP release is an a very strong
Very strong attraction of other platelets
TB3A allows binding via fibrinogen
Activated platelets, swell, create spikes, and have over 50 000 binding sites for fibrinogen
Fibrinogen is circulating -> made by hepatocytes
Fibrinogen cleaved to fibrin

Negatively charged surface phospholipid complex
Complexes are key sites in the clotting cascade

You can reverse at this stage
At the same time clotting cascade is occurring
When the monomer fibrin makes polymers and cross-links you can't split it apart

Negatively charged complexes
Prothrombin to thrombin which cleaves fibrinogen to fibrin and that fibrin cross-links

Extrinsic is shorter than intrinsic
The common pathway is common to both
Intrinsic molecules are intrinsic to blood
Extrinsic starts with tissue factor, factor 3, tissue thromboplastin, inside cells, not circulating, need a vascular injury
Intrinsic: When you walk into a store 12 dollars equals 11.98
Extrinsic: 3 + 7 = 10
Common: 10 =5 x 2 x 1
Roman numerals are conventional with an "a" at the end to indicate active
No factor 12 or no factor 11 or no HWK (Height molecular weight kininogen which is a co-factor) due to genetics. Redundancy in the system covers these issues
- Factor 10 can be activated by the intrinsic or extrinsic pathway
- Activated platelets can activate factor 11 or factor 12
Blood with factor 11 of 12 can switch those on.
Intrinsic = contact pathway
The shorter extrinsic pathway is the main generator of fibrin in vivo and gets switched off very quickly (regulated by 10a concentration).  pathway will take over
Initially, thrombin formation is an amplifier and can act on factor 8, factor 11, and can activate factor 5
Thrombin = factor 2
Factor 13 does cross-linking

The tissue model of coagulation, with emphasis on short extrinsic pathway, showcases the role of amplifiers

Too much coagulation can lead to thrombosis
Partially or fully blocking a blood vessel
Need checks and balances
- Antithrombin system
- Protein C and protein S system
- Tissue factor pathway inhibitor
- Fibrinolytic system

Hepaaran sulphate expressed on the endothelial cell surface
Antithrombin 3 (major) in active circulation, found in hepatocytes
Binds to Hepaaran but only if thrombin in the area, the complex will go to the liver where it will be processed
Gets rid of thrombin and other clotting factors
Thought to be responsible for 4/5 of anticoagulation of bloodstream
Liver failure means not enough antithrombin produced which can lead to clotting issues

Dissolved C and protein S in blood, vitamin K dependent, produced by hepatocytes
Endothelial cells express thrombomodulin which with thrombin activates protein C to CA which activates protein S

TFPI switches off the extrinsic pathway which activates factor 10 which generates just enough thrombin to start the reactions
Concentration when activated 10 is high enough will bind to the TFP on endothelial cells and SM cells

Lysis of fibrin
Get rid of the secondary plug via fibrinolysis, broken down via plasmon -> breaks down fibrin into fibrin degradation products which will eventually be broken down
Plasminogen -> Plasmin, produced by hepatocytes
Liver failure can cause haemorrhage or thrombosis
Plasminogen activates moves plasminogen to plasmin
Plasminogen activates come from tissue (Eurokinarse plasminogen activators, macrophages in the peritoneal cavity, and mesothelial cells as well) and from vascular plasminogen activators which are activated by endothelial cells (damaged endothelial cells, don't want to overdo it)
Too much plasmin is taken away from alpha 2 antiplasmin which is also produced by hepatocytes, also there are plasminogen activator inhibitors
DIC can have an overabundance of plasmin
