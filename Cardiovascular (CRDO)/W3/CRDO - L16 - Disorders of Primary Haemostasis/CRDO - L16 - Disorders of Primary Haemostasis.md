Haemorrhage byrexis is by tearing
microscopic haemorrhage, in strategic locations can be important
Small amounts of haemorrhage by diapedesis if leakage from various sources such as inflammation

Haemoperitoneum - Abdomen
Haemothorax - Chest
Haemopericardium - Pericardium
Haematuria - Kidney
Haematisis - Coughing of blood
Epistacksis - Bleeding from nostrils
Haematomisis - vomiting of blood
Dystery - diarrhea with blood
Malena - Black poo with blood evenly mixed
haematochezia - Fresh blood in poo
Haemoarthritis - Blood in joints
Haephyma - Bleeding into inner chamber of eye

Can't palpate:
Petechae - micro haemorrhages
Perpura - larger haemorrhages
Echymosis - cm sized
Paint brush haemorrhages

Can palpate:
Haemotaema
Aural haematomas in dogs from heavy shaking
Other haematomas

Newer bruises are purple because of the blood
Middle has biliverdin (green)
Haemacitorin, golden brown colour

The location of the haemorrhage is important, a haemorrhage in the cranial vault increases intracranial pressure leading to death
Bleeding into pericardial sac can prevent right ventricle filling leading to death
Bleeding into the retina can cause blindness

Bleeding internally allows you to recycle iron

What are the causes of haemorrhage
?
Trauma
Viral
Haemostatic problems
Rupture of internal organs
Gut parasites
Well vascularized tumours

Protracted bleeding
Longer to stop bleeding

Not enough platelets
Platelets not working correctly - thrombocytopathy, von Lebrans disease

Epistaxis could be either primary or secondary but always assume trauma first

If it has traits of both primary and secondary it is likely DIC

Most common presentation in dogs and cats is thrombocytopenia

```
Bone marrow issues (common in cats)
Platelet destruction (more common in dogs, immune-mediated)
Consumption of platelets (from heartworm) leads to reduce platelet, haemangioma sarcoma
Big spleens, neoplastic spleens, big livers, neoplastic livers

```
FeLV is really common, RBC WBC, FIDV
Bone marrow could be excess lymphocytes, neutropenia in advance

Colostrum ingestion on some piglets can disrupt platelets as they inherited epitopes from the boar

Thrombopathies can be inherited
Needs to be confirmed by specialist labs

Platelet disease often by drugs, chronic renal disease, FIV, chronic liver disease, lupus, plasma cell tumour, multiple myeloma
NSAIDs, Cardiprin, Flunix, Aspirin -> mild and temporary

von Willebrand connects to activated platelets to the collagen
High-pressure, high-velocity areas
Can be reduced or absolutely missing
Type 1 = not as bad
Type 2 = middle
Type 3 = bad
Type 1 is most common (Dobermans), but not as bad
Scottish terrier has type 3
All autosomal recessive
Rarely spontaneous
Prolonged bleeding at oestrus
More deaths in young pups because of umbilical cord
Don't often see fine petechiae because von Willebrand only needed at major vessels
Usually protects factor as it is complexed and normally has a protective effect against proteases so von Willebrand disease could reduce facto r8

Rocky Mountain spotted fever, numerous small vessels are damaged
Viraemia causing petechiae
Anything that causes a vasculitis

Scurvy in pigs, primates, guinea pigs
Lack of vitamin C, no cross-linking, blood vessel fragility

```
Inherited collagen disorders
Poorly controlled diabetic leading to collagen breakdown and skin fragility
Very uncommon focus on other ones first
