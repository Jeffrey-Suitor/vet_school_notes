# CRDO - L14 - Perturbations of Flow, Hyperaemia, Congestion, and Oedema

## CRDO - L14

### Hyperaemia and Congestion

What are two variations in blood flow and perfusion?
?
Hyperaemia
Congestion
A local increase in blood flow within a tissue

What is hyperaemia
?
Active
Increased blood going into the tissue
Red-oxygenated blood

What is congestion
?
Passive
The outflow of blood reduced
Reddish-blue - not oxygenated

What is the appearance of hyperaemia
?
red colour - oxygenated colour
Warm to the touch

What are some causes of hyperaemia
?
Physiologic
- Digestion
- Exercise
- Dissipate heat
- Neurovascular response (blushing)
Pathological response
- Can be seen in eyes or gums, oedema from itching
- Parvovivral enteritis (hyperaemia of intestine)

Outline congestion
?
Passive engorgement of blood vessels
Decreased blood outflow
Appearance
- Dark red to blue/black colour - poorly oxygenated blood
- Cooler than normal
- Swollen
Potential causes:
- Rectal or vaginal prolapse
- Heart failure
Gross appearance
- Dark red to blue/black - depending on the degree of stagnation
- Cut surface ooze blood and often wet

What two factors determine the severity and consequences of congestion
?
Duration 
- Acute (sudden)
- Chronic (long-term)
Extent
- Localised - a discrete area is affected
- generalised - a systemic change

T/F arteries are more likely to collapse::False, the artery is thicker-walled

Vaginal prolapse is not as severe as anal prolapse because no sphincter

Outline the consequences of congestion in a live animal
?
Acute
- Engorged capillaries
- Oedema
Chronic
- Hypoxia - reduced O2
- Degeneration/necrosis

Outline generalized lung congestion
?
Inflated
Red in colour
Acute = sudden event, blood accumulates
Chronic = heart failure, black flow, 

Outline hypostatic congestion
?
Hypocalcemia after parturition
This can lead to hypoxia and necrosis
Dependent on congestion / hypostatic congestion
Often lying on one side
The top is red, the bottom is purple because of blood pooling

### Oedema

Accumulation of fluid in tissues

Which parameter in the artery changes over the capillary::plasma hydrostatic pressure, high to low from artery to vein

Outline the simplified model of fluid movement
?
Net loss of fluids from the blood vessel at the arterial end
High hydrostatic pressure
A small amount of fluid drains into lymphatics
Net gain of fluids into a blood vessel at the venous end
Plasma colloid osmotic pressure
The fluid movement affected by vascular permeability

What are the causes of oedema
?
Increased plasma hydrostatic pressure
Decreased plasma colloid osmotic (oncotic) pressure
Lymphatic obstruction
Increased vascular permeability
Sodium retention

Outline the effects of increased plasma hydrostatic pressure
?
Increased pressure at the venous leads to more fluid being pushed out of the vein and not returning
Caused by disorders that impair venous returns
- Venous obstruction or compression (Anal and vaginal prolapse, intestinal torsion, iliac vein obstruction during pregnancy)
- Ascites due to liver cirrhosis (hydroperitoneum caused by liver failure)
- Congestive heart failure (reaches the left side of the heart and circulates in the major heart
  - Left heart failure is in the lungs because blood from the lungs can't flow and pools
    - Lung parenchyma will be red or dark blue in colour and fluid-filled, fourth in the trachea
    - Alveolar capillaries are distended and fluid accumulation in alveoli
    - In cattle and pigs, you can see the interlobular area
    - Permanent congestion -> RBC in alveoli -> macrophages in alveoli consume RBCs -> Haemolysis of RBCs leaves dark brown pigments and macrophages containing these pigments are called centrophages or heart failure cells
  - Right heart failure is in the abdomen because blood from the abdomen cannot flow back in
  - - Fluid accumulation leading to ascites
  - Hepatic changes, acute and chronic, oozing of blood
  - Nutmeg appearance of liver, blood around the centrilobular area
  - Red - periacinar congestion +/- haemorrhage / necrosis / atrophy
  - Yellow - periportal and mid-zonal hydropic degeneration/lipidosis

Outline periacinar congestion
?
Lymph accumulates in the space of Disse
Drains to capsular lymphatics
Lymphatics overwhelmed
Ascites

What other structures in the abdomen can be impacted by congestion due to RSCHF
?
Spleen
Kidneys
Stomach and intestines
Pancreas
Associated mesenteries
Hydrothorax -> lung collapse
Hydropericardium

Outline a decrease in plasma colloid osmotic pressure
?
Decreased albumin production\
- Malnutrition/starvation
- Severe hepatic disease
Excessive albumin loss
- Protein-losing enteropathy -> Too much protein lost
- Protein-losing nephropathies
- Gastrointestinal parasitism
- Severe haemonchosis
- Severe burns
Chronic protein malnutrition leads to decreased albumin production
Advanced liver disease -> hypoalbuminaemia

Describe lymphatic obstruction as a cause of oedema
?
Poor lymphatic drainage -> lymphoedema
Poor lymphatic drainage -> ventral and preputial oedema
Lymphatic obstruction by nematodes

Outline how increase vascular permeability causes oedema
?
Mediators (histamine, bradykinin)
Cytokines (IL-1, TNF)
Causes
- Infectious agents
- Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP)
- Oedema disease in a pig (endothelial injury)
  - Bacterial organisms
  - Virus
- Hypersensitivity
  - To venoms, vaccines, allergens (swollen eyelids and swollen face, type 1 is IgE mediated)
  - Urticaria
- Trauma/burns
- Toxins - Uraemic toxins

Outline sodium retention as a cause of oedema
?
Exacerbates oedema formation caused by increased plasma hydrostatic pressure and decreased plasma osmotic pressure
Renin and angiotensin keep salt and water inside the blood
More fluid -> forces more out -> oedema
Indirect salt poisoning
- Water intake restricted -> dehydrated but in equilibrium
- Water intake restored -> influx of water into brain -> acute oedema
