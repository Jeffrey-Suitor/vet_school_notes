## CRDO - L09

The greatest decrease occurs in arterioles

Relating the flow equation to cardiovascular performance
?
Flow (Q) = pressure difference (delta P) / resistance (R)
Q = cardiac output (litres/minute)
Delta P = pressure gradient (equivalent to MAP)
Resistance. = Resistance to flow through the vascular tree is mainly determined by resistance in the arterioles

Outline the measures of cardiovascular performance
?
Maintenance of a pressure gradient is critical to maintaining the flow and perfusion of tissues
Mean arterial pressure = cardiac output x resistance
Pressure (mean arterial pressure) is maintained by modulating resistance and cardiac output
MAP: mean arterial pressure = diastolic pressure = pulse/pressure/3
Systolic pressure: peak pressure as blood is ejected
Diastolic pressure: pressure when the aortic valve is closed
Cardiac output = Hr x SV, amount of blood pumped per minute
Stroke volume = EDV - ESV, the volume of blood ejected with each heartbeat
Total peripheral resistance (TPR), is overall resistance to flow through the entire circulation

What is preload::force stretching a relaxed myocardium

What is afterload::force opposing shortening of the myocardium during contraction

Outline the determinants of stroke volume
?
Venous return determines the end-diastolic volume
- Increasing muscle length (Frank-Starling principle)
Sympathetic drive which modifies contractility
- The force generated for any given length (Increasing intracellular Ca during contraction)

Outline the effect of cell length on stroke volume
?
Cell length determines the overlap of thick and thin filaments
The length of related cells is determined by the amount of blood in the ventricle
At a certain length overlap between thick and thin filaments is optimal and for a given rise in Ca will result in maximal tension
Normal cell length is less than maximal

Outline the physiological significance of the Frank-Starling relationship
?
The length-tension relationship of the heart muscle allows for the equalisation of output from the left and right sides of the heart
Increased output from the right side of the heart leads to increased filling of the left ventricle (increased EDV), hence increased stretch of cardiac muscle fibres, increased force development in the left ventricle and increased left ventricular output
Increased arterial blood pressure leads to higher afterload and a reduction in the volume of blood ejected from the heart with each beat. (ejection fraction)
The resultant increase in end-systolic volume and end-diastolic volume increases cardiac muscle stretch, thereby increasing the force of contraction and stroke volume

Outline the role of positive inotropes
?
A positive inotrope is any agent that increases peak isometric tension at a fixed length
Inotropes act by modulating Ca levels in cardiac muscle cells.

Outline how increasing the force of contraction in cardiac muscle
?
In skeletal muscle - force is increased by increasing
- Frequency of action potentials
- Number of fibres stimulated (recruitment)
In cardiac muscle
- Action potential frequency is determined by SA node -. beat 
- All fibres contract with. each heartbeat
Increased force of contraction (any given fibre length) depends on intracellular Calcium concentration
Intracellular calcium concentration:
- Depends on the entry of Ca through VOCC
- Release of Ca from the sarcoplasmic reticulum 
- both of these are modulated by cell surface receptors
Depends on the stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system

What are the results of the binding of noradrenaline to the beta-adrenergic receptor on cardiac myocyte leads to 
- Activation of adenyl cyclase
- Increased intracellular cAMP
- Phosphorylations of VOCC
- Increased inward movement of Ca
- Increased Ca release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and over time more Ca stored in SR
- Increased actin-myosin cross bridging 
- Increased force of contraction 

Outline the increasing force of contraction in cardiac muscle
- Drugs can also be used to increase (or decrease) the force of contraction
- Positive and negative INOTROPES

Why does Frank have poor exercise tolerance?
?
Regurgitation through an incompetent valve leads to reduced stroke volume
This leads to reduced cardiac output -> reduced exercise tolerance
Bad preload and increased EDV are not matched by increased CO

Increased respiratory effort = lungs = left side heart problems = mitral valve regurgitation
