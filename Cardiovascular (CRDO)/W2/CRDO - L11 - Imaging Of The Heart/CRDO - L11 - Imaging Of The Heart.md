# CRDO - L11 - Imaging Of The Heart

## Intended Learning Outcomes
- List the different methods available for imaging the heart  
- Understand the basis of the images that they produce (two- or three-dimensional; composite or slices)  
- Recall the radiographic anatomy of the canine and feline heart  
- Understand how radiology and sonology may be used for the assessment of the cardiovascular system  

## CRDO - L11

What are the different methods of imaging the heart?
?
Radiography
Ultrasonography
Echocardiography
CT, MRI, Angiography

How do we position for thoracic radiology
?
Chemical, Physical restraints can be used
Lateral projection
Ventrodorsal projection
Dorsoventral project
Marker on the left side but the right side of the image

Outline the radiographic appearance of the heart is influenced by
?
Positioning VD or DV
- VD = heart along the spine, DV = heart along sternebrae
- Poorly positioned thoracic radiography
Phase of respiration
- Inspiration = smaller, expiration = larger
The phase of the cardiac cycle
Conformation
- Differences in hearts are significant
Sternal and pericardial fat
- Check BCS because the fat may be changing orientation

What is the difference between the cat and dog heart?
?
Cat heart sits more cranially
Right-hand side is most of cranial border

What is heart disease::Any abnormality of the heart, encompassing everything from valvular regurgitation to a persistent left CVC

Heart failure::End result from severe heart disease and is a clinical syndrome seen as congestion and oedema, poor peripheral perfusion or systemic hypertension

Heart disease::is always present when heart failure is present however heart disease can be present and never lead to heart failure

What are the changes associated with heart disease?
?
Alteration to size and or shape of the cardiac silhouette
Alteration to the size of the pulmonary vasculature
Radiographic signs of cardiac failure
- Pulmonary oedema
- Peritoneal effusion
- Pleural effusion (cats)

Metrics of a healthy heart in the dog
?
To assess trachea position::Line from trachea and vertebrae, must be less than 40 degrees
Heart no more than 2/3 height of the thorax
No wider than 2.5 to 3.5 intercostal spaces
The caudal border of the heart should be flat, and should not be straight

Metrics of a healthy cat heart
?
5th to 7 and make sure the heart is not as wide
Heart height no taller than 3 sternebrae

What is the vertebral heart score
?
2 lines across the heart cranial to caudal, apex to base
Drawn from T4 vertebrae going caudally
Add them together, normally is less than 10.7 in dogs
Variation in dogs

Outline the vertebral left atrial size (VLAS)
?
Measured from the cranial margin of T4
The tracheal border at the caudal dorsal border the caudal vena cava
A VLAS >= 2.3 - 3.5 can be used as an indicator of LA enlargement
Used in MMV

Pulmonary veins are central and central

Outline cardiac disease vs cardiac failure
?
The heart can cope and employ compensatory mechanisms to function
When it can't  = heart failure
- Pulmonary oedema
- Pleural effusion
- Peritoneal effusion (ascites)

What is echocardiography
?
ultrasound assessment of cardiac function and chamber size
B mode
M mode
Doppler - colour and spectral
Common right hands side views
- Right parasternal short axis view
  - See all chambers
  - ![[Screenshot 2023-08-04 at 13.39.13.png]]
- Right parasternal long axis view
- (4 chamber and 5 chamber)
- Left atrium to left aorta comparison with normal being less than 1.6
