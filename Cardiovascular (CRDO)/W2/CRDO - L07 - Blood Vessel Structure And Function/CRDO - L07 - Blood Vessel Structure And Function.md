Tunica media - middle layer: mechanical strength and contractile power
Tunica adventitia - outer layer: tethers vessel to surrounding tissues

Outline the arterial wall structure
?
Tunica intima
- The flattened endothelial cell layer
- Basement membrane

Outline conducting arteries
?
Elastic arteries - large and thick-wallet
Very distensible - lots of elastin in their wall
Recoil when stretched:

- Arterioles
- Meta-arterioles
- Capillaries
- Post-capillary venules
- Sinusoids

Outline arterioles
?
Regulate total peripheral resistance
Control flow of blood to capillary beds (together with meta-arterioles)
Wall structure:
- Tunica intima
  - Non-fenestrated endothelium
  - Supported by basement membrane and a few c.t. cells
- Tunica media
  - Only 1-2 layers of smooth muscle cells
- Tunica adventitia
  - Composed of loose c.t.

Outline the meta-arterioles
?
Regulate total peripheral resistance
Cooperate with smaller arterioles to control flow of blood to capillary beds
Wall structure
- Tunica intima
  - Single layer of non-fenestrated endothelium
  - Supported by a basement membrane and a few ct..t fibres
- Tunica media
  - Varies from single intermittent layer of smooth muscle cells to none being present
- Tunica adventitia - poorly recognised

Outline peripheral vascular resistance
?
Blood pressure decrease in consecutive segments of the vascular tree
Largest drop in the arteriolar segment
Pulsatile flow also disappears
Resistance is the opposite to flow
Flow = pressure/resistance
Resistance = difference in mean pressure needed to drive one unit of flow (increase resistance = increase difference)
The biggest pressure drop occurs across arterioles -> main site of resistance to blood flow (resistance vessels)

Outline the resistance vessels
?
Decrease blood pressure, loss of pulsatile flow
Decrease blood flow velocity
Increased cross-sectional area (reaches a maximum in exchange vessels)
The rate of blood flow (L/min) remains the same across all vascular segments

Outline total peripheral resistance
?
Total peripheral resistance is the resistance to flow through the entire systemic circulation
TPR = (mean aortic pressure - vena caval pressure) / cardiac output
Mean aortic pressure (Pa) = Co x TPR (vena caval pressure close to zero)
TPR is an important determinant of arterial pressure

Outline the determinants of arterial pressure
?
Mean arterial pressure: average pressure driving blood through organs
MAP = CO x TPR 
Cardiac output = SV x HR
MAP = diastolic pressure + 1/3 pulse pressure

Outline the exchange vessels
?
Outline metabolic exchange takes place across walls
Metabolic exchange takes place across walls: oxygen, carbon dioxide and metabolites
Low resistance, high cross-sectional area
Includes capillaries, sinusoids and post-capillary venules

Outline capillaries
?
Classification based on 
- Position in the vascular bed
- Nature of endothelial lining
  - Continuous with thick endothelium
  - Continuous with thin endothelium
  - Fenestrated (glomerular capillaries in the kidney)
Wall structure
- Two essential components
  1. Thin endothelial cell layer
  2. Basement membrane
- External to this
  - A sparse network of c.t.
  - Often a pericyte

Outline sinusoids
?
Exchange vessel
Endothelial channel
Irregular bulging vessel: Greater capacity than slender capillary
Wall structure:
- Discontinuous endothelial lining
- Endothelial cells - multiple fenestrations
- Basement membrane - fragmentary or absent
Enable interchange of fluids and macromolecules and easy movement of cells across the endothelium
Characteristic of haemopoietic tissues

Outline post-capillary venules
?
Exchange vessels
Resemble large capillary
Drain several capillaries
Wall structure:
- Continuous endothelial cells layer
- Supported by a basal lamina
- Surrounded by a few pericytes some c.t.
- No or few smooth muscle cells
- Joins between cells 'leaky' - promotes migration of WBC

Outline arteriovenous shunts
?
Simple arteriovenous shunt
- Connects arteriole with a muscular venule
- A thick ring of smooth muscle cells in walls - sphincter-like action
Thoroughfare channel
- Connects meta-arteriole to post-capillary venule
Glomeriform arteriovenous anastomosis
- Role in thermoregulation

Outline capacitance vessels
?
Large volume and low pressure
Return blood to the heart
Includes muscular venules and veins

Outline the wall structure of veins
- Tunica intima
  - Same as arteries except for NO internal elastic lamina
- Tunica media
  - Relatively small amounts of SMC and elastic fibres
  - Usually abundant collagen fibres
  - No external elastic lamina
- Tunica adventitia
  - Many large collagen fibres in the c.t.
  - Often the thickest layer

Outline veins as capacitance vessels
?
Veins are: thin-walled, contractile and voluminous
Contain about 2/3 of the total blood pool
Act as a reservoir of blood
Crucial role in stabilising and regulating the venous return of blood to the heart

Outline venous tone
?
Venous tone influences cardiac filling and stroke volume
The largest volume of blood is stored in veins of systemic Organs (peripheral venous pool)
Blood also stored in great veins of the thorax and R atrium (central venous pool)
Constriction of peripheral veins: blood moves peripheral - central venous pool
This increases cardiac filling and stroke volume

Outline factors controlling the venous return
?
Smooth muscle contraction (sympathetic NS)
Skeletal muscle pump effect
One way valves
Thoracic and cardiac pressure (includes pressure gradient between veins and heart)

Outline the valves in blood vessels
?
In the lumen of veins
Composed of two cusps
Valves present in medium-sized veins - especially in limbs
Reduce the hydrostatic pressure and aids the 'muscle pump'
