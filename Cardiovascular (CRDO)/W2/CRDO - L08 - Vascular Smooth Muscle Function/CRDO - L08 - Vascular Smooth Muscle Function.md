## CRDO - L08

Outline the vascular smooth muscle cells
?
Three types: skeletal, cardiac and smooth
Vascular smooth muscle cells present in the tunica media of some blood vessels
Changes in their contractile tension (tone) constrict and dilate vessels
Spindle-shaped cells wrapped around vessels
Overlapping actin-myosin filaments are the contractile units
Thin filament (actin) is longer -> enables greater shortening
Poorly developed sarcoplasmic reticulum -> rely primarily on Ca2++ ions from ECF to initiate contraction
Actin filaments anchored to **dense bodies** (instead of Z disks) in the cytoplasm and **dense bands** in the cell membrane
Not aligned across the cell -> no striations
Appear to wrinkle on contraction

Outline vascular smooth muscle contraction
?
Contraction triggered by a rise in intracellular Ca2+
Most of the increase in Ca2+ arises from the influx of extracellular calcium; a relatively small contribution from intracellular stores
Two broad groups of excitation-contraction coupling:
1. Electromechanical coupling: depolarisation of the VSM cell -> opening of L-type voltage gated calcium channels
2. Pharmacomechanical coupling: Binding of a signalling molecule to a receptor leads to an increase in intracellular Ca2+ either 
  - Via G protein-coupled release of intracellular stores
  - Opening of receptor-operated calcium channels (no membrane potential change)

Outline how to go from the rise of Ca2+ to a contraction in smooth muscle
?
Increase in Ca2+
Ca2+ + calmodulin complex
Ca-calmodulin - Myosin Light Chain Kinase
Phosphorylation of Myosin Light Chains
Myosin forms a cross-bridge with actin
Contraction of Smooth Muscle Cells

Outline the role of amlodipine
?
Ca2+ channel blocker -> causes VSM relaxation
Used to reduce hypertension (high blood pressure)
Normally monitor cat blood pressure

Outline the differences in vascular smooth muscle
?
Contracts slowly maintain tone for long periods of time
Low energy requirements (low ATP utilisation)
Poorly developed sarcoplasmic reticulum
Cell-to-cell conduction via gap junctions (as for cardiac muscle)
No troponin, no voltage-operated Na channels

Outline vascular tone
?
Vascular tone is the state of contractile tension in vessel walls
The basal vascular tone produced by vascular smooth muscle contraction is sustained continually -> This maintains arterial blood pressure
Tone increase = vasoconstriction
Tone reduction = vasodilation
Can be maintained by spontaneous depolarization
Changes in tone modify resistance and therefore flow
A number of factors modify this tone -> fine control of tone

Outline the mechanisms controlling vascular tone
?
1. Intrinsic mechanisms
  - Regulation by factors entirely within the vasculature
    - Myogenic response
    - Vasoactive metabolites
    - Endothelial secretions
  - Intrinsic mechanisms are responsible for autoregulation, active and reactive hyperaemia
2. Extrinsic mechanisms
  - Regulation by factors outside the vasculature
    - Neural control (vasomotor nerves)
    - Hormonal control (vasoactive hormones)
- Extrinsic mechanisms can override intrinsic mechanisms to meet the needs of the animal

Outline the myogenic response
?
Vascular smooth muscle contracts in response to stretch and relaxes with a reduction in tension
Important because
- Contributes to basal tone
- Stabilises tissue blood flow if arterial pressure changes
Particularly prominent mechanism in cerebral, coronary and renal arterioles
Change in diameter of rat cerebral artery upon raising intraluminal pressure (P)
Initial passive stretch followed by active contraction
Mediated by depolarisation and Ca2++
Depolarisation initiated by stretch-activated channels
Response sustained by tension sensitive channels

Outline vasoactive metabolites
?
Metabolic products released into interstitial fluid cause alterations in local blood flow
Function to match blood flow to metabolic demands of tissue
Vasoactive metabolites contribute to metabolic (active) hyperaemia and reactive hyperaemia

Outline metabolic (active) hyperaemia
?
Metabolic by-products act as local vasodilators -> increased coronary blood flow
Increase blood flow in response to increased metabolic rate

Outline reactive hyperaemia
?
Temporary increase in blood flow following a period of reduced blood flow
This leads to rapid restoration of O2 supply and wash out of accumulated waste products
Blood flow is stopped by clamping the femoral artery (dog) for 15,  30, and 60 seconds
Release after the 60s resulted in peak blood flow y70% greater than control flow, returning to normal after around 2 mins
Peak flow and duration of hyperaemia proportional to the duration of occlusion

Outline the role of endothelial cells
?

Describe endothelial secretions
?
![[Screenshot 2023-08-02 at 20.20.14.png]]
Endothelium-induced flow-dependent relaxation
Increased flow -> increased shear stress -> ECs produce NO

Outline NO-induced vasodilation
?
Nitric oxide is a labile gas molecule produced by ECs
NO signalling
- activates guanylyl cyclase (GC)
- GC converts GTP to cyclic GMP (cGMP)
- cGMP activates kinases that promote relaxation

What is nitroprusside
?
Nitric oxide donor
Given IV, given CRI
Rapid and significant dilation
Heart failure, reduce afterload

Outline autoregulation
?
Autoregulation: vascular resistance changes that tend to maintain a constant blood flow
Constant flow desperate range of perfusion
Pressure-flow relationship: skeletal muscle (dog)
Closed circles = flows immediately after abrupt changes in perfusion pressure (experimental)
Open circles is normal blood flow
![[Screenshot 2023-08-02 at 20.28.27.png]]
Achieved by:
- Myogenic response
- Flow-induced endothelial relaxation
Preserves tissue flow in the face of changing arterial pressure
Protects capillaries from excessive hydrostatic pressure

Outline control of arterial tree
?
Different mechanisms control different vascular beds
![[Screenshot 2023-08-02 at 20.30.24.png]]

Outline neural control of vascular smooth muscle
?
Neural control of vascular tone involves two types of autonomic nerves:
1. Sympathetic nerves - predominantly vasoconstrictor
2. Parasympathetic nerves - vasodilator
Vasoconstrictor and vasodilator refer to the effect of an increase in nerve activity
Reduction in vasoconstrictor activity can cause vasodilation

Outline sympathetic vasoconstrictor nerves
?
Postganglionic sympathetic fibres terminate in the outer border of the tunica media
Fibres release vesicles containing noradrenaline (NA)
NA activates alpha adrenoceptors causing vasoconstriction
- Arterioles (all organs)
- Veins (abdominal organs)
Increased sympathetic activity:
- Increases peripheral resistance (increases TPR)
- Reduces local blood flow
- Displacement of blood from peripheral to central veins
![[Screenshot 2023-08-02 at 21.04.38.png]]

Outline parasympathetic vasodilator nerves
?
Parasympathetic fibres release vesicles containing acetylcholine (Ach)
Ach activates M3 muscarinic receptors on ECs -> synthesis of NO dilation
- Coronary arterioles
- Genital arterioles
- Salivary gland arterioles

Outline hormonal control of vascular tone
?
Adrenaline
Antidiuretic hormone (ADH)
Angiotensin
Insulin
Thyroxine
Oestrogen
Paracrine/autocrine
- Serotonin
- Histamine
- Bradykinin
- Thromboxane

Outline extrinsic control overriding intrinsic control in haemorrhage
?
Atrial baroreceptor and volume receptor
Sympathetic activation
Increased TPR, reduced local blood flow, contraction of veins -> displacement of blood to central veins
Partial restoration of cardiac filling pressure
