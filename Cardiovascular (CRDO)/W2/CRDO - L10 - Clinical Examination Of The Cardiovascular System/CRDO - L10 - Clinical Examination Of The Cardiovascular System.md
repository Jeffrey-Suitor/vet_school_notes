# CRDO - L10 - Clinical Examination Of The Cardiovascular System

## Intended Learning Outcomes

- Identify key aspects of a general clinical examination pertinent to assessing the function of the cardiovascular system;
- Describe what dynamic changes during the heart cycle create each of the normal heart sounds (S1, S2, S3, S4);
- Know where anatomically to clinically auscultate the major heart valves;
- Know what changes to the normal heart sounds may be detectable on cardiac auscultation;
- Be able to identify the key factors used to characterise murmurs;
- Appreciate the respiratory signs and pulmonary auscultation findings that may be associated with cardiac failure.

## CRDO - L10

What are the key elements of the clinical examination?
?
Appraisal of body condition
Observation of respiratory rate and effort
Mucous membrane colour and capillary refill time
Jugular vein examination m
Pericardial palpation
Arterial pulses
Arterial auscultation
Pulmonary auscultation and percussion
Abdominal palpation

Outline body condition appraisal
?
Appropriately grown for age
Loss of muscle mass
Non-thoracic abnormalities

Outline observation at rest
?
Respiratory rate and effort
- Can be difficult in a consultation setting
- Train owners to monitor at home
The increased rate can indicate congestive heart failure

Outline mucous membranes
?
Mucous membrane colour
- Normal healthy pink
Capillary refill time 
- Normal: <2 sec

Outline cyanosis
?
Blueish tinge to mucous membranes or skin
Generally indicates respiratory compromise
Cardiac causes
- Pulmonary oedema, pleural effusion
- Right to left PDA
  - Differential cyanosis
- Pulmonic stenosis or pulmonary hypertension with ASD or VSD 
  - Generalised cyanosis

Outline examination of systemic
?
Jugular vein most commonly assessed
Distension
- Hepatojugular reflux
- Increased filling pressure (often right-sided CHF)
- Thrombosis or extramural pressure
Pulsation
- Tricuspid valve insufficiency
- Cardiac tamponade
- Pulmonary hypertension
- Other signs of increased right-sided pressures

Outline Precordial palpation
?
precordial thump
- Feel the heart hitting the body wall
Precordial thrill
- Vibration associated with turbulent blood flow
- Auscultation will reveal a murmur

Outline arterial pulses
?
Palpation simultaneous with auscultation
Pulse pressure = systolic pressure -diastolic pressure
- Bounding pulse
  - Quick decay diastolic pressure
    - PDA
    - Aortic valve insufficiency
  - Weak pulse
    - Ejection impedance
    - Cardiac tamponade
    - Shock (cardiovascular collapse)
    - Aortic stenosis
- Pulse deficit?

Outline cardiac auscultation
?
Patient preparation important
- Quiet 
- Still, standing
- Not panting or purring
- Forelimb held/placed forward
Through auscultation over entire precordium

Outline the heart sounds 
?
 
| Sound | Aetiology                       |
| ----- | ------------------------------- |
| S1    | Closure of the AV valves        |
| S2    | Closure fo teh semilunar valves |
| S3    | Rapid early ventricular filling |
| S4    | Atrial contraction              |

S3 and S4 are normal in large animals

Outline heart murmurs
?
Abnormal sounds - turbulent blood flow
Described by: 
- Timing
- Intensity
- Point of maximal intensity
- Radiation
- Quality/character

Outline murmur characterisation by timing
?
Systolic murmur
- Holosystolic -> S1 + S2 and lasts whole time
- Pan systolic -> whole time and hides S1 + S2
Diastolic murmur
Continuous murmur
To and fro murmur
- Two separate problems

Outline heart murmurs: Intensity
?
Grading system: 1 - 6
 
| Grade | Description                                                                                                      |     |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- |
| 1     | Just detectable after prolonged auscultation; very localized                                                     |     |
| 2     | Quite a localised murmur is heard immediately once the stethoscope is placed over the point of maximum intensity |     |
| 3     | Moderately loud; easily heard                                                                                    |     |
| 4     | Loud murmur heard over a wide area with no palpable thrill                                                       |     |
| 5     | Very loud murmur with an associated precordial thrill                                                            |     |
| 6     | Very loud murmur with thrill; may be heard with stethoscope just off the skin surface                            |     |
Grade not proportional to severity of disease
- Size and velocity of turbulent jet
  - Smaller ventricular septal defect louder murmur
- Contact with heart wall
  - Mitral regurgitation directed to middle of atrium vs atrial wall
